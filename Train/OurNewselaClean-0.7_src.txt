"Amtrak\'s living on a shoestring," said Steve Ditmeyer, a former associate administrator for research and development at the Federal Railroad Administration.
The fatalities included a U.S. naval midshipman and an employee of The Associated Press.
As seen from TV news footage and pictures posted to social media, pieces of the train were strewed around the track, which bends in a sharp curve in Northeast Philadelphia.
Ditmeyer said a Northeast Corridor improvement project in the late 1970s and early 1980s was supposed to straighten out curves, but that got cut from the budget.
Numerous curves, bridges and tunnels restrict the speed of all trains on the Northeast Corridor.
Part of the train overturned, and one car was reduced to a twisted heap of shredded metal.
"They\'re well over a hundred years old.
The system, called positive train control, is designed to prevent trains from exceeding speed limits as they approach curves.
On Tuesday night, an Amtrak train derailed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, killing at least seven people.
However, the system of overhead wires and supports that supplies power to the trains dates to the 1930s.

Some feel it receives too little money to fully meet its needs.
Amtrak President Joe Boardman has said the tunnels need to be replaced soon.
However, the system of overhead wires and supports that supplies power to the trains dates back to the 1930s.
Amtrak says 62 percent of the overhead wires and 42 percent of the steel supports need to be replaced.
The accident occurred along the heavily traveled Washington-to-Boston route known as the Northeast Corridor.

When Olivia Hernandez was a middle schooler in Oxnard, California, she became hooked on K-wave \u2014 the global phenomenon of South Korean pop music, television and culture.
She and other students are learning grammar basics and the honorifics used to address elders and bosses.
According to a recent national study, enrollment in Korean language courses at U.S. colleges and universities showed the largest percentage growth of any foreign language.
The number of students in Korean classes nationwide \u2014 12,230 \u2014 is well below the most studied languages, including Japanese, Chinese and Arabic.
"There\'s no doubt that Korean popular culture in film and music has captivated the minds of young people," said Rosemary Feal, executive director of the Modern Language Association.
According to university officials and professors, some of the interest in Korean is coming from the children and grandchildren of Korean immigrants.
Some were drawn by the K-pop dance moves of Psy in his 2012 international video hit "Gangnam Style" or by the English-subtitled TV series "Queen of Housewives."
He became more proficient in Spanish, which he studied in high school.
Among the exercises were sentences with connective contrasts, which instructor Jae Eun Im wrote on the board and had the class repeat aloud.
They included Korean translations of "The food is cheap but it doesn\'t taste good" (Eumsiki ssande masi eobseoyo) and "It is winter but it is not cold" (Gyeourinde an chuwoyo).
She and other members of a campus club of K-pop fans recently visited Koreatown.
Although it\'s still hard for her to read Korean lyrics fast enough, a more important lesson was reinforced: learning another language, she said, "breaks down barriers between people and teaches them to look beyond surface level."

Los Angeles "is a great place to study Korean," said UCLA humanities dean David Schaberg, who is a Chinese language and literature scholar.
And it is a way to connect back with the culture," said Hahn, a political science major in the heritage class.
Learning sentence structure, diction and vocabulary, he said, also will help him in what he hopes will be a career in law.

Currently, just 154 colleges offer Korean classes, but that is 70 percent more than a decade ago.
Students are taking science and business classes, at the expense of humanities like history and philosophy.

Andrew Hahn, a senior at UCLA, said his first language at home was Korean but that he did not get much beyond a childhood level.
Learning sentence structure, pronunciation and vocabulary, he said, also will help him in what he hopes will be a career in law.
They included Korean translations of "The food is cheap but it doesn\'t taste good" and "It is winter but it is not cold."
She became a fan of such K-wave groups as the boy band Super Junior and the group Big Bang.
They shopped at a music store, ate at a Korean restaurant and sang along to Korean music at a karaoke club.
Learning another language, King said, "breaks down barriers between people and teaches them to look beyond surface level."
President Barack Obama urged the nation Tuesday night to "turn the page" on years of economic troubles, terrorism and lengthy wars, arguing that his presidency had ushered in an era of smarter American leadership and a growing U.S. economy.
"It\'s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come," Obama said in excerpts released ahead of his State of the Union address.
In two potential areas of compromise with Republicans, he was to call on Congress to pass cyber security legislation and a new authorization for military action in the Middle East.
It wants to set up its own country governed by Islamic law.
The morning after the State of the Union, Obama was headed to a pair of conservative-leaning states to promote his agenda for his seventh year in office: Idaho and Kansas.
Russia, Singapore and South Korea were also on the list.
The polling site is less than a half-mile from the Canfield Green apartment complex where Brown was killed.
Bell, an advocate for community policing, said that whomever interviews for the police chief\'s job "better be doing his homework."
Smith lost to Wesley Bell.
Whoever interviews for the police chief\'s job "better be doing his homework," Bell said.
Smith is a top all-women college that costs $63,950 each year, not including books.
The poorest students, like Olmos-Govea, have only a 1 in 10 chance of graduating in six years.
I started talking to her like I would any other homesick student," said Marge Litchford, a top official at Smith, who started the program for first-generation students.
However, some small private colleges are trying to change that.
At Smith, nearly 9 out of 10 first-generation students graduate within four years.
As a new student, Olmos-Govea did not feel very comfortable.
She is the first one in her family to go to college.
"New Planet Found" is about as exciting a headline nowadays as "Dog Bites Man," which is to say, not very.
It is part of our own solar system\u2014a place you would think we had explored pretty well by now.
But the evidence is strong enough that other experts are taking very serious notice.
This was a case where we had our noses buried in the data, never stepping back and looking at the solar system from above.
The directionality of the orbits was an even stronger hint that something was physically herding these distant objects.
When the scientists turned to the "crazy" notion of a planet, however, their simulations generated just the right kind of aligned orbits.
The mood of the astronomical community is perfectly captured, Laughlin says, by something British astronomer John Herschel said to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in a talk on Sept. 10, 1846.
Referring to the mystery object, Hershel said: "We see it as Columbus saw America from the shores of Spain.

The planet that best fits the data would be on the order of 10 times as massive as Earth.
It would put the new planet in the so-called "Super Earth" category, which includes many planets around other stars, but none, until now, in our own solar system.

In 2014, Trujillo and Scott Sheppard, of the Carnegie Institution for Science, argued that there might be something planet-sized out there.
In the last 20 years, astronomers have identified about 2,000 new worlds using a telescope in space.
"Sadly," Brown says, the scientists haven\'t actually detected it yet.
It includes many planets around other stars but none, until now, in our own solar system.
Even at that enormous distance, Planet Nine might be seen with a telescope.
This new planet, though, is a very different story.
This new planet could be 10 times bigger than Earth.
Under a blazing sun and amid a sea of Venezuelan flags, thousands gathered Saturday afternoon in a Doral, Fla., park in solidarity with anti-government protests in Venezuela.
"I\'m here because we are tired of the government we have," said Maria Archer, a Venezuelan who has lived in the United States for 15 years.
Carlos Tagliafica, one of the many South Florida volunteers, said the rallies were to support the students in Venezuela who have been leading protests there.
The protests have been characterized by some media observers in Caracas as the biggest since Maduro replaced President Hugo Chavez, who died March 5 last year.
Prominent opposition figure Leopoldo Lopez also has been jailed on charges of fomenting violence, sparking outrage among supporters and criticism by human rights groups.

Workers began erecting the 1.1 million pounds of scaffolding in May 2014.
Members of Congress worry about spending money, and unrelated issues often get thrown into the decision-making.
The trucks that enter the grounds and hundreds of workers have to be screened every day, cutting into working hours.
In addition to just under $60 million for the dome repairs, the phased project includes $16 million to refurbish the interior and $21 million for work on the soaring rotunda.
The rotunda has largely remained open to visitors and staff, closing for only a few weeks in April 2014 to hang the cloth canopy.
In addition to just under $60 million for the dome repairs, the phased project includes $16 million to refurbish the interior and $21 million for work on the soaring rotunda.
Workers have begun removing some of the scaffolding and plan to finish in time for the 2017 inauguration.
The nearly $60 million project started with a coffee can full of rust.
He wanted to make sure that tourists who climbed near the top on tours with members of Congress would not shake anything loose.
He then ordered that workers rebuild ornaments, strip away layers of paint from more than a century ago, and replace some heavy glass windows.
In addition to just under $60 million for the dome repairs, the project includes $16 million to fix up the interior and $21 million for work on the soaring rotunda.
"We\'ll see if that can be maintained," she said of the repair cost.
Since then rust has built up.
He used to carry the can to meetings held by lawmakers, to show them that the dome was crumbling above them.
Many of the bolts that held the iron dome together had fallen off.
The dome had not been repaired in more than 50 years.
Lofgren said that they cannot let the dome fall apart.

Brady gave the union his approval later Tuesday for a lawsuit to be filed on his behalf, according to a person familiar with the situation.
Nevertheless, Goodell concluded that Brady\'s actions harmed "the integrity of, and public confidence in, the game of professional football."
He completed 19 of 27 passes for 182 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions last season.
New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady and the players\' union are headed to a legal clash with the National Football League (NFL) over "Deflategate."

New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady and the players\' union are headed to a legal clash with the National Football League (NFL) over "Deflategate."
The Patriots defeated the Indianapolis Colts 45-7 in that game and went on to win the Super Bowl against the Seattle Seahawks.
In his ruling, Goodell wrote that the evidence showed that Brady participated in the scheme to let air out of the footballs.
Yee pointed out that no quarterback was ever suspended for four games in connection with deflated footballs.

Staff performers must follow rules about what they wear, how they act and how they get dressed.
The characters also cannot reveal to children at the park that they are really actors.
However, she feels the current policies take things too far.
She does not think it is reasonable to forbid staff from posting anything online about their character identities at work.
Dalton wondered if workers could be disciplined if their family members post pictures or information about the characters.
It was also questioned whether Disney entertainers would get in trouble if they used the information on their resumes to get other entertaining jobs.

A coalition of Tunisian workers, business owners, rights activists and lawyers won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for intervening at a crucial time to push the North African country that sparked the Arab Spring revolutions toward democracy and away from civil war.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet "for its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy" following Tunisia\'s 2011 revolution that overthrew its long-time dictator.
"It established an alternative, peaceful political process at a time when the country was on the brink of civil war," the committee said in its citation.
The prize is a huge victory for small Tunisia, whose young and still shaky democracy suffered two extremist attacks this year that killed 60 people and devastated its vital tourism industry.
Mohammed Fadhel Mafoudh, head of the Tunisian Order of Lawyers, called the Nobel Peace Prize a message to all parties embroiled in political conflicts.
Tunisian broadcast media interrupted coverage to excitedly announce the news, and social media exploded with celebratory commentary.
Tunisian protesters sparked uprisings across the Arab world in 2011 that overthrew dictators and upset the status quo.
But it is the only country in the region to painstakingly build a democracy, involving a range of political and social forces to create a constitution, a legislature and democratic institutions.
Nobel committee chairwoman Kaci Kullmann Five said the prize was meant to encourage the Tunisian people and to show an example for other countries in the region, where the pro-democracy struggle has come to a standstill.
"We hope we will contribute to safeguarding democracy in Tunisia and those who seek to promote peace in the Middle East and North Africa," she told The Associated Press.
Kullmann Five said the 8 million Swedish kronor ($960,000) prize was for the quartet as a whole, not for the four individual organizations.
It was formed after the July 2013 assassination of left-wing politician Mohammed Brahmi plunged Tunisia into crisis, with opposition parties boycotting the Parliament.
A national dialogue led by the quartet helped negotiate a transition from the elected Islamist-led government to an interim government of technocrats tasked with organizing new elections for a permanent government.
Houcine Abassi, the leader of the Tunisian General Labour Union, said he was "overwhelmed" as he found out about the award from an Associated Press reporter.
French President Francois Hollande said he was "happy for all the Tunisians" and added the prize marks the success of the former French colony\'s transition to democracy.
"That is an encouragement to support Tunisia even more through all the hard times it faces, as we\'ve seen with terrorist acts in the last weeks and months," Hollande said in Paris.
The prize comes the day after unidentified assailants shot repeatedly at a lawmaker and a prominent sports magnate in the Tunisian city of Sousse, which depends heavily on tourism.

Other shark experts claim the actual population is several times larger, a legacy of state and federal laws curbing pollution, banning near-shore gill netting, protecting sharks and halting the slaughter of marine mammals they prey on.
The census was conducted from 2006 to 2008 on sharks that gather around Tomales Point, near Bodega Bay, and the Farallon Islands off the San Francisco coast from late July until late January.
"It\'s a lot easier counting elephants and lions," Block said, referring to animal counts in Tanzania\'s Serengeti region.
Eric Martin, educational co-director of the Roundhouse Aquarium at the end of the pier, recalled a weekday last July when a fisherman hooked a 7-foot white shark.
They get caught in nets called "gill nets."
Officials have been studying the health of the great white population since last year.
The groups did this after the first census of the sharks came out in 2011.
The census was conducted from 2006 to 2008 on sharks that gather off the San Francisco coast from late July until late January.
His long-term monitoring of white sharks suggests the actual population is much larger.
Other scientists are finishing a separate census study that will show there are more than 2,000 adult and younger white sharks off Central California.

The first new edition was published in March and includes news and an interview with Governor Brian Sandoval, as well as a modern version of the so-called "sagebrush humor" Twain helped make famous before he became America\'s favorite man of letters.
Thompson has high hopes for the paper, which began with a circulation of 2,500 copies.
She has spent recent months researching Twain and the time period in which he wrote and is ready to try and match, if not precisely the wit, then at least the spirit of those days, and said she thinks Twain would be pleased.

"The people that guessed 90, 70, 120, they\'ve already lost," says Stephen Kendrot as he drives along a Wicomico County, Md., back road.
The nutria project leader is coming back from a site in Quantico, Md., where four of his trappers are roaming the Wicomico River in jon boats.
It has taken longer than expected but, finally, the state is almost free of the invasive rodents.
A study in the 1990s proved that, even with other contributing factors, nutria were largely responsible.
In Louisiana, the nutria population reached 20 million in 20 years, creating a problem that is now too large for eradication.
The team is confident they can get rid of the nutria in Maryland.
They have pioneered various detection approaches that help them track, trap and kill the nutria, and the team has also collected a huge amount of information about the creatures.
During the first year of trapping on the peninsula, the team caught 5,000 nutria at the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge and in adjacent private lands, Kendrot said.
Kendrot said the line of work is controversial but justified when considered from an environmental point of view.
Led by Kendrot, the project has cleared marshes up and down the Delmarva Peninsula over the last 12 years.
The wetlands in the Chesapeake region have experienced more marsh loss than most other wetlands around the world, Kendrot said.
They have established colonies in states throughout the Southeast and Pacific Northwest.
During the first year of trapping on the peninsula, the team caught 5,000 nutria at the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge and in adjacent private lands, Kendrot said.
There are probably between 200 and 500 nutria remaining in the area, Kendrot said.
But there are other places that can never fully recover.
It\'s to save the marsh," Kendrot said.

"Bringing on Misty Copeland is the best decision we\'ve ever made," said Adrienne Lofton, senior vice president of global brand marketing for Under Armour, the Baltimore-based sportswear giant.
Copeland has performed many principal-level roles recently, including the female leads in "Romeo and Juliet" and "Firebird," but at the rank of soloist.
The film rights for her best-selling memoir, "Life in Motion," were optioned by New Line Cinema last summer.
She also has become a sensation on social media, peppering her more than 500,000 followers on Instagram and Twitter with pictures of her performing or relaxing in Under Armour tops and tights.
"Every time I step onto the stage, it\'s not only proving to the audience that I\'m capable but to myself."
"We\'ve always had powerful female athletes, but we\'ve never had a story as dynamic as Misty\'s, with that underdog mentality she has ... bucking up against all these traditional norms, showing men, women and kids that athletes come in all shapes and sizes."
Copeland, whose new role will start August 1, was widely expected to be among the three women selected as principals this year.
When it came to my childhood\u2014growing up in a single-parent home, often struggling financially\u2014my mother definitely instilled in me and my siblings this strength, this will, to just continue to survive and succeed."

Misty Copeland made history on Tuesday when she was promoted to principal dancer of the American Ballet Theatre (ABT).
She is deeply respected and admired for her unlikely rise in an arts world notorious for showcasing only slim white ballerinas.
Copeland, whose new position starts August 1, was widely expected to be among the three women selected as principals this year.
Earlier this spring, Copeland made her American debut in the lead role of Odette/Odile in "Swan Lake" at the Kennedy Center in Washington.
"I haven\'t come from the typical path or background of someone who would make it to this level as a ballerina," she told a newspaper at the time.
She has also performed in concert with Prince and judged contestants on Fox television\'s "So You Think You Can Dance."
The film rights for her best-selling memoir, "Life in Motion," were bought last summer.
The retailer now calls that ad campaign its most successful in history.
And yet, as Copeland said, her accomplishments are still as important personally as they are publicly.

Extending their protests into the workweek, Hong Kong democracy activists continued occupying major thoroughfares Monday, forcing the closure of some schools, banks and other businesses in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.
Without a cohesive group of leaders directing things, "it\'s very difficult to predict" how the situation will evolve, said Chi-Keung Choy, professor of comparative politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
No one can convince them, unless the government makes big concessions."
In addition, many of the youths who make up a forceful component of the demonstrators have little sense of connection to mainland China and instead embrace a strong identity as Hong Kongers.
Hong Kong has a rich tradition of protests, but demonstrations are typically well organized and calm, with people gathering in designated parks and marching along pre-planned routes with official permits.
The free-form and unpredictable nature of the last few days of protests have surprised local residents \u2014 and spurred many of them into the streets in solidarity.
"It\'s shocking to see armies of police equipped with tear gas guns, rifles and batons," said Nan Hie In, who joined demonstrators on the streets Sunday night.
Even so, Ip said he remained undaunted because "we\'re fighting for the future of Hong Kong.
Leung had said over the weekend that local officials would soon launch a new round of consultations over the 2017 election rules.

After all his calculations, only two dumplings went down his gullet, while 52 went into a takeout box.
He has even conducted a time-study of how the structure of xiao long bao changes upon leaving the steamer and starting to cool in a bid to determine the ideal window in which to devour the hot little pouches before the skin thickens too much.
Since late 2013, he has worked his way across this sprawling city of 24 million, paying surprise visits to 52 purveyors of these delicacies on a quest for the ideal xiao long bao.
"They were (angry)," St. Cavish recalls, glancing through the front window to see whether the older woman who had to hand-make his infuriating 54-dumpling order is behind the counter today.
"It\'s a funny experiment; I don\'t want people to take it too seriously," he says, sitting in a booth at Zun Ke Lai, his measuring paraphernalia and three baskets of dumplings in front of him.
But at the same time, he says, the index gives restaurant-goers \u2014 and himself \u2014 a way to think more deeply and talk more precisely about the architecture behind what makes a food satisfying or even delicious.
"I\'m not sure if xiao long bao has benefited from this analysis, but I\'ve benefited."

Before coming to China, St. Cavish did not know a lot about science and had never even eaten a Chinese soup dumpling.
Even today, he says they are not his favorite food, and he does not cook them at home.
He wanted to weigh and measure food, and compare the measurements to find out which food was best.

(Only a few creatures, including dragonflies, move their wings in the relatively simple up-down motion that many people expect.)
The researchers wanted to build something that can be built small, but simply, and still remain stable in the air without too much thinking.
The design could be useful for the military, Ristroph said, though he was more excited about civilian applications.
Theoretically, he said, mini flying jellies could be tossed into the air from a building and float around as environmental sensors, taking data and adjusting their position when necessary.
A team from New York University has designed a flying jellyfish-like robot that uses four flapping wings to stay aloft.
A team from New York University has designed a flying jellyfish-like robot that uses four flapping wings to keep itself aloft.
The jellyfish, in some ways, appears ideal for this task since they are very simple creatures.
Their bodies resemble an umbrella or a bell-shaped figure with tentacles dangling down.
"It\'s an excellent example of bio-inspired engineering," said Caltech University professor John Dabiri, who attended the Pittsburgh meeting and is an expert on how jellyfish swim.
"I wanted to think of something very different," said Leif Ristroph, a mathematician at New York University.
The Irukandji jellyfish, on the other hand, can be less than an inch wide.
Designs modeled after animals and bugs with wings are "a great place to start in terms of building a flying machine," said Ristroph.
Jellyfish may not look very athletic, but they swim through the water without wasting too much movement.

Alan Friedlander, chief scientist of the National Geographic Pristine Seas Program, told a recent forum at the East-West Center in Honolulu that dredging kills off a reef.
All the countries that border it have claims; China says its sovereignty extends over almost the entire sea, on the basis of a map that was drawn up right after World War II.
On Monday May 11, a touring group of journalists from the United States and 11 countries that lie on or near the South China Sea visited the Foreign Ministry here in Beijing.
Ouyang Yujing, director general of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs, said China was entirely within its rights, and within the law, in building the new islands.
She said her agency is working on transplanting some reefs, and a government lab is developing techniques to regrow coral.
When Adm. Harry Harris accused China of building a "Great Wall of sand" by creating artificial islands in the South China Sea to bolster its territorial claims there, one of the things he mentioned was that the Chinese were dredging sand and dumping it on reefs of living coral.

Thousands more students could be eating school lunch completely free starting next fall, thanks to a 4-year-old federal program that is finally expanding to all 50 states.
The expansion comes through the so-called Community Eligibility Provision, passed by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010 as part of a [broader school nutrition measure](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch).
Originally, districts had until the end of June to decide, but the federal government extended the deadline into August to give districts more time, especially after some delays in publishing the list of schools or districts eligible.
Schools where 40 percent or more of the students automatically qualify for the school lunch program, because their families are already receiving food stamps, for example, are eligible to use community eligibility.
At that point, she said, "It really becomes easier to give everyone the free meals."
She said some unrelated funds, like per-student aid from the state based on free-lunch enrollment levels, are tied to paperwork that could be more difficult to collect if no application is necessary for the free lunch program.
Thousands more students could be eating school lunch completely free starting next fall, thanks to a 4-year-old federal program that is finally expanding to all 50 states.
Certain schools in three states (Illinois, Kentucky and Michigan) were eligible first, based on need and their data-sharing capabilities.
As a result, not all school districts are expected to participate.
In Fort Wayne, Indiana, for example, officials will offer the expanded lunch program at all elementary and middle schools starting this fall.
The district had some elementary and middle schools that already had 95 percent or more of their students covered by the free-lunch program, said Krista Stockman, a spokeswoman for the district.
Thousands more students could be eating school lunch completely free starting next fall, thanks to a 4-year-old federal program that is finally expanding to all 50 states.
There are more than 28,000 such schools nationwide.
In Fort Wayne, Indiana, for example, officials will offer the expanded lunch program at all elementary and middle schools starting this fall.
St. Paul, Minnesota, is another district that is moving slowly.
This fall, a free lunch could be coming to thousands more students around the country, thanks to a 4-year-old federal program that is finally expanding to all 50 states.
There is no cost to them \u2014 no application necessary and regardless of household income.
In most states, hundreds of schools are eligible, according to a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Schools where 40 percent or more of the students automatically qualify for the school lunch program are eligible to use community eligibility.
Officials wanted to wait and see the effects in neighboring districts, district spokeswoman Tamyra Kelly said.
Leslie Fowler is the executive director of nutrition support services for Chicago schools.
She said that to make the new program work, they had to be sure enough students would qualify under existing rules.
They reached their set level of enrollment under older free lunch rules, 62.5 percent of all students in the district.
Without it, the funds could be more difficult to collect if no application is necessary for the free lunch program.

In Fort Wayne, Indiana, officials will offer the new lunch program at all elementary and middle schools starting this fall.
She said that to make the new program work, they had to be sure enough students would be able to join under existing rules.
"It doesn\'t make sense to do district-wide if you don\'t get to that threshold."
The government moved the deadline into August.
It wanted to give school districts more time to decide.
Nobody knows for sure how many new districts will join this year.
"Everyone\'s got a great meal that they can get at no charge," said Madeleine Levin of the Food Research and Action Center.
Under the new program, the government pays for only a fraction of the new schools getting the meals.
Some schools have four out of 10 students who can get a free lunch.
Without a major change in how teachers are taught, America will continue down the same path, raising generation after generation of students who do not understand what it means to be an American, who equate freedom of speech with "selfies," who believe freedom of religion requires purging religion from the public square, who think our Founding Fathers \u2014 denigrated in popular culture as dead old white men \u2014 are irrelevant.
To successfully teach U.S. history and government, so students understand and appreciate the principles that define our American character, teachers need to rely less on textbooks and more on the writings and thinking of those who shaped our country.
Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or its editors.
The result is that our country has continued \u2014 although often belatedly \u2014 to correct past mistakes in its 239-year quest to create a more perfect union.
As Peter Levine, an associate dean for research at Boston\'s Tufts University, recently pointed out: "Requiring students to pass a citizenship exam will reduce both the amount and quality of civic education in our schools."
In the Baltimore area, where I live, the highlights of rich local history become even more fascinating when linked to those of the nation.
In civics \u2014 the test covering the subject of U.S. government \u2014 the scores were somewhat better.
Still, slightly less than one-fourth of all high school seniors performed at or above the "proficient" level.
Teachers spend too much time learning how to teach \u2014 the mechanics of pedagogy \u2014 and not enough time learning what to teach.
Teaching government and history involves more than just stringing together an agreed-upon chronology of significant dates and events and connecting them with names.
It involves more than cursory familiarity with a handful of historically significant documents, such as the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights and Emancipation Proclamation.
By all means we should recognize ours flaws at home and costly mistakes abroad.

Applied across the U.S., this approach can make history come alive.
If this continues, how can we expect them to affirm and defend these principles as adults?
It involves more than superficial familiarity with a handful of historically significant documents, such as the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights and Emancipation Proclamation.
Instead they should rely more on the writings and thinking of those who shaped our country.
Stuffing in more American history and civics classes is exactly the wrong way to accomplish that worthwhile mission.
Typically classes teach about the U.S. crimes against Native Americans, Mexicans, African-Americans, Irish and Italian immigrants, women and most recently, the lesbian, gay and transgender communities.
As Peter Levine of Boston\'s Tufts University recently pointed out: "Requiring students to pass a citizenship exam will reduce both the amount and quality of civic education in our schools."
Instead, history and government courses are too often taught in public schools as a series of human rights abuses.
It forces students to spend numerous hours each month away from the classroom.
The National Assessment of Educational Progress has shown consistently that many students are not even mastering the basics of U.S. history and government.
Teachers spend too much time learning how to teach, and not enough time learning what to teach.
Our Founding Fathers are already belittled in popular culture as dead old white men.
They also may end up associating Washington and Lincoln as having something to do with Presidents Day, a holiday when everybody goes shopping.
To successfully teach U.S. history and government teachers need to rely less on textbooks.
It would also include Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation, Gettysburg Address and "Resolution Submitting the Thirteenth Amendment (outlawing slavery) to the States."
Teaching teenagers to be better citizens would be better left to parents and other family members, and local schools.

But we should also recognize that our founders were wise and exceptionally well-educated.
They created a system of government that corrects itself.
For example, the most recent NAEP U.S. history exam was in 2010.
Teachers spend too much time learning how to teach and not enough time learning what to teach.
These kids will think freedom of speech means the right to take "selfies."
Our Founding Fathers are already commonly referred to as dead old white men.

They might just think the Fourth of July is a day for fireworks and a cookout.

Some even are being made to attend re-education sessions to ensure they are learning liberal ideas.
Uriana had helped arrange that marriage as part of his function as palabrero, a title that literally means "the word."
When it comes to matrimony, Uriana said that freedom of choice is not a legitimate option within the Wayuu culture: "All our marriages are arranged by the families and the couple has to live by that."
His other tasks include resolving land disputes, monitoring debt payments and dividing lumber and other community assets.
School director Nelson Iguaran says these bilingual schools are essential to preserving the Wayuu way of life and shielding students from outside pressures.
Not long ago, most Colombians looked down upon palabreros and other Wayuu customs.
Colombians are gaining a newfound respect for the Wayuu and other native groups.
Part of the reason for this change is a new Language Law that was passed in 2010.
The ministry also included the languages used by Afro-Colombians and criollos (people of Spanish descent).
This time, the ministry used the information to produce a computer program.
At one of these schools, first- through eighth-graders from the Wayuu community are taught by instructors who speak both languages.

"It reduces the forces that are keeping the fault clamped together \u2014 leading to more small earthquakes during dry periods of time," said Colin B. Amos, assistant professor of geology at Western Washington University, the study\'s lead author.
Other scientists studying a seismically active area of southern Monterey County near Parkfield observed that there are often more earthquakes during dry months than during wet months.
The groundwater theory introduced by Amos and his colleagues gives one possible answer.
He called the suggestion that groundwater depletion could lead to more earthquakes "somewhat controversial" and that more study is needed elsewhere in California and around the world to see if the findings can be replicated.
Groundwater has been slowly depleted in the Central Valley to quench the thirst of farms and cities since the mid-1800s.
The study published Wednesday does not suggest the next Big One to hit Los Angeles or San Francisco will be caused by human activity, Amos said.

In contrast, sections of the San Andreas closer to San Francisco and Los Angeles are much stronger and more locked.
The number of earthquakes there every year has roughly doubled between 1984 and 2005.
Parkfield was the starting point of a magnitude 7.9 earthquake that hit the San Andreas fault in 1857.
"It won\'t necessarily happen that way" again in our lifetime, she said.
The San Andreas fault is a major source of earthquakes.
U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Susan Hough said the idea that groundwater depletion can trigger earthquakes is very possible.
He called the suggestion that groundwater depletion could lead to more earthquakes "somewhat controversial."
Other scientists studying a seismically active area of southern Monterey County observed that there are often more earthquakes during dry months than during wet months.

In the 1930s, water rerouting prompted the disappearance of Tulare Lake, once the largest body of fresh water west of the Mississippi River.
Groundwater has been slowly drained in the Central Valley to quench the thirst of farms and cities since the mid-1800s.
The study does not suggest the next Big One to hit Los Angeles or San Francisco will be caused by human activity, Amos said.
That fault was so massive that shaking lasted from 1 to 3 minutes.
That means not much change in pressure is needed to loosen the fault and cause earthquakes.
That fault was so massive that shaking lasted from 1 to 3 minutes.

"I was already frustrated at how addicted to texting my daughter was," said the San Clemente, California, father of four, who at the time had just learned a grim statistic: More than 7,000 Americans had died from texting and driving the previous year.
In the process, the organization plans to gather several thousand signatures from drivers who pledge to avoid texting while operating their vehicles for the next 12 months.
NASCAR drivers Kyle Busch and Joey Logano and 100,000-plus others already have signed their names to the side of the yellow Text Kills bus that has been crisscrossing the United States since 2010.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140227_FOODLABELS.jpg" />WASHINGTON \u2014 On Thursday the Obama administration proposed the first major revamp of nutrition labels in more than two decades.
The revision is aimed, in part, at addressing serious public health issues.
The FDA should also display the amount of sugar as a percentage of recommended daily intake, argued Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
Jacobson noted that the American Heart Association recommends women consume no more than 25 grams of added sugar per day and men no more than 35 grams per day.
To ensure compliance with the proposed requirement, companies would have to keep records of added sugar for FDA inspection.
The FDA proposal would also revise serving sizes to reflect the most recent data on consumer habits.
With the update, the serving sizes set in 1994 would increase for some products, such as ice cream, but would decrease for other products, such as yogurt.
This would provide a nutritional breakdown by both serving size and container size.
Administration officials said an economic analysis indicated the new labels could bring between $20 billion and $30 billion in benefits.

On the proposed new labels, the calorie count would appear in larger, bold typeface.
However, consumers often drink soda in 12-ounce cans or even larger bottles.
But the proposed rule would require the serving size to be at least 12 ounces.
"The half-cup of ice cream" or "2-ounce muffins and bagels," he said, haven\'t been seen in American eating habits "in decades."
This would provide a nutritional breakdown by both serving size and container size.
Administration officials said widespread obesity was one of the primary reasons for the update.
While acknowledging that the new labels alone would not solve the epidemic, they said they believe they could help curb it.

ATTLE - Suicide looms over Indian Country, claiming more lives of native youth than those in any other population.
The Spokane-based program for the past five years has helped 65 tribes across the country combat suicide, the second-biggest killer of native youth, after accidents.
"The car accident, the gun death, the overdose, there are a lot of suicides that are not reported as such," said Victoria Wagner, executive director of the Youth Suicide Prevention Program.
As in Washington, the suicide rate among native youth nationally is 2-1/2 times that of any other youth population, Bailey said.
Patricia Whitefoot, director of Indian Education for the Toppenish School District, said suicide prevention is a top priority identified by parents of students at Toppenish High School in Yakima County.
Native students embarked on a wellness walk last Friday to emphasize the positive role that culture can play in this, she said.
The Colville, Spokane and Yakama tribes also are using prevention grants and training through the Native Aspirations Program.
"The car accident, the gun death, the overdose, there are a lot of suicides that are not reported as such," said Victoria Wagner, executive director of the Youth Suicide Prevention Program.

Chicago also says computer science will eventually become a high school requirement.
"In the 21st century, computer science is just as foundational as biology, chemistry," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org, a Seattle-based national nonprofit that works to expand access to computer science and increase participation by women and minorities.
"We\'re not talking about turning everybody into a computer programmer or computer scientist," said Kafai.
Jim Taylor, author of "Raising Generation Tech," says there\'s no evidence at this point that coding or computational learning works or is even needed.
"Technology is the solution du jour for all our education problems.
"Just as important is the fact that computing is everywhere in our lives," Century said.
Among other efforts, an initiative of the National Science Foundation is seeking to have 10,000 well-trained computer science teachers in thousands of high schools.
"It\'s access that we didn\'t previously have," Sheward said, and ensures the kids will be as prepared as their peers are for the digital future, she said.

Supporters say it is not just about learning how to code, but learning how computers work.
It also exposes them early to the technology that will drive their future, supporters say.
Still, the argument in favor of teaching computer science is the same argument as for science and math, she said.

Researchers have done thousands of studies on gaming since the 1980s, often with unmistakably negative results.
Some associated video games with an increased risk of epileptic seizures, while others cautioned that the games could provoke dangerously elevated heart rates.
One recent project actually concluded that some children who play violent games are less likely than others to act like bullies.
Games can be this really important tool for teaching people what the right decisions might be.
Maybe one way to do that is showing what the consequences of wrong decisions would be."
Youth survey data she examined found that those who play video games for an average of three to six hours a day were healthier than those who played less.
That theory made sense to Dan Wojtowicz, 18, a student at Andrew High School in suburban Tinley Park, who spends up to seven hours a day on "StarCraft II," "League of Legends" and other games.
The most intriguing studies might be coming from neuroscientists, who are using MRIs and other high-tech devices to learn how gaming affects the brain.
Now that he\'s 21, he spends up to four hours a day battling enemies in the virtual arena of "Dota 2."

When a new generation of scientists more familiar with a technology comes along, different results often appear in studies, said Christopher Ferguson, a psychology professor at Stetson University in Florida.
One recent project actually concluded that some children who play violent games are less likely than others to be bullies.
Another take on video game violence came from University of Buffalo communications professor Matthew Grizzard.
He found that those who played the bad guy role in shooter games often felt guilty.

After French-born Islamic radicals shocked the country with three days of terror attacks in January, the French government launched a new effort.
Valls held a special government meeting to tackle this divide in society.
Twenty people, including the three gunmen, were killed in the attacks on a kosher market and satirical paper Charlie Hebdo.
Many in the suburbs of Paris understood why some children did not observe the moment of silence, even if they condemn the terror attacks.
"People were killed in the housing projects by police, and there was no minute of silence" for them, said Aly Sacko, a 28-year-old working in Clichy-sous-Bois.
Soaring unemployment, a high crime rate and even a lack of access to public transportation to get to jobs fed a deep sense of inequality.
The model assumes that all colors, races and creeds will blend into a single people.
When he was president, Nicolas Sarkozy made fixing the suburbs a priority.
It included $728 million to create new trains and tramways, an expansion of "second-chance schools" for dropouts, and professional guidance for thousands of youths wanting to start a company or get on a job track.
For example, take the housing project that was home to Amedy Coulibaly, one of the gunmen in the Paris attacks in January.
It remains a different universe from the government palaces of the capital, just a few miles away.
After French-born Islamic radicals shocked the country with three days of terror attacks in January, the French government launched a new effort.
Concern about schools jumped to the forefront of national debate after some children refused to observe a minute of silence for victims of the Jan. 7-9 attacks.
Unrest first broke out in 1990.
The big wake-up call came in 2005 with fiery nationwide riots.
But here on the gray concrete of the projects, he added, "there isn\'t any."

The Obama administration has stopped short of saying openly that North Korea was involved in the intrusion.
Senator John McCain, Republican from Arizona, who called Sony\'s decision to cancel the movie\'s release "profoundly troubling," has long demanded the U.S. step up cyber operations and said the Obama administration was slow to respond to the attack.
Earnest insisted that responses under consideration may be ones "that we wouldn\'t want to telegraph in advance."
North Korea is "really working on their cyber capability; it gives a poorer nation international reach," retired Brigadier General Michael McDaniel, a former Pentagon official, said.
In June, the nation called the plot of "The Interview" an "act of war."
Still, it lauded the hacking as a "righteous deed of supporters and sympathizers."
Earnest insisted that responses under consideration may be ones "that we wouldn\'t want to telegraph in advance."
President Barack Obama, in an interview Wednesday on ABC News, acknowledged that the attack against Sony shows the United States has more work to do to strengthen its information security.
With U.S. intelligence analysts quietly pointing to North Korea as having a hand in the destructive hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment computers, Obama administration officials scrambled Thursday to consider what, if anything, they should do in response.
The hackers demanded that the movie studio cancel the release of its film "The Interview."
Experts now say the cyber attack seems likely to have originated from North Korea.
Existing sanctions were imposed in an attempt to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.
In response to the cyber attack and threat against movie theaters, Sony canceled the Christmas Day release of "The Interview."
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that responses under consideration are ones "that we wouldn\'t want to telegraph in advance."
So far, administration officials have given somewhat differing accounts about the degree of its involvement.
One senior administration official, speaking anonymously, said intelligence agencies have linked North Korea to the attack.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has not confirmed that the North Korean government, directly or through a second source, was behind the hacking operation.
Last year, South Korea concluded the North was behind a hack of banks and news organizations known to be critical of North Korea.
He said the FBI should know more about the cyber attack in coming days, and that the United States will work hard to prevent further attacks.
"But for now," the president added, "my recommendation would be that people go to the movies."
Right now their options seem limited.
They make it difficult for the country to buy from and sell to other countries, and for North Koreans to travel.
In part this is because it is unwilling to reveal what information it does have.
Still, it praised the hacking as a noble deed carried out by "supporters and sympathizers."
Such computer attackers are called hackers.
"The Interview" was already attracting attention before the cyber attack.
North Korea is an extremely poor country.
However, experts believe the country does have a small group of skilled hackers working for it.
It shows that the United States must do more to keep its computer systems safe.
His advice for Americans, the president said, "would be that people go to the movies."

In a country where Fidel Castro once proposed breeding mini-cows for pasturing in backyards, it should be no surprise that Cubans have become masters of improvisations and inventions in the face of their myriad scarcities.
Cubans have been "resolviendo" \u2014 loosely translated as "making do" \u2014 since shortages of all types began hitting the island in the early 1960s, shortly after the U.S. government slapped the first trade sanctions on the Castro government.
"The revolution injected Cubans with inventiveness to survive the shortages created by the Americans, and now the Cubans use it to survive the deficiencies of the revolution," Oroza said.
With gasoline becoming scarce and expensive, some Cubans worked out ways of converting their car and truck motors to natural gas, and put the potentially explosive containers in the trunks of their vehicles.
Other inventions are simply ingenious.
Oroza recalled that in the early years of the Castro revolution, there was even a group designed to promote the improvisations and inventions, the National Association of Innovators and Rationalizers.
A year later, the two entities published a second book with the ideas for gadgets, work-arounds and herbal medicines that had been sent in by readers, proudly titled "With Our Own Efforts."
In a country where Fidel Castro once proposed breeding mini-cows for pasturing in backyards, it should be no surprise that Cubans have become masters of improvisations and inventions in the face of their myriad scarcities.
But the reality is that there have been so many shortages, a super-precarious economic situation," said Cuban-born Miami designer Ernesto Oroza, who has collected the inventions since the mid-1990s.

In a country where Fidel Castro once proposed breeding mini-cows for pasturing in backyards, it should be no surprise that Cubans have become masters of improvisations and inventions in the face of their myriad scarcities.
The state-controlled media regularly praise the virtues of Cuban ingenuity.
"And now the Cubans use it to survive the deficiencies of the revolution."
The Cuban revolution of 1958 resulted in a much lower standard of living for the Cuban people, as well as shortages and little freedom.
In one of his notoriously failed attempts at improvisation, Castro proposed in 1987 breeding cows down to the size of dogs.
With gasoline becoming scarce and expensive, some Cubans worked out ways of converting their car and truck motors to natural gas.
They put the potentially explosive containers in their trunks.
Bare electrical wires connected to cans or short pieces of pipe were used as water heaters for showers.

Oroza recalled that in the early years of the Castro revolution, there was even a group designed to promote the improvisations and inventions.
Even in 1991, he added, the Cuban military and the Federation of Cuban Women printed a book on "making do."

Some or all of the art, estimated to be worth $1.3 billion or more, was thought to have been looted by the Nazis more than 70 years ago.
Robert Edsel wrote a book which chronicles the search for art looted during World War II.
The German government told reporters Monday that it was notified of the haul several months ago by Bavarian officials in southern Germany.
Focus said that Gurlitt sold off individual pieces when he needed money.
In one instance, he was able to put a painting by German Expressionist Max Beckmann up for sale at an auction.
He was reputed to have a truckload of art, and he said, \'It\'s all rumors, all of it was destroyed, I just have a few paintings from my dead father and my sister,\'" Webber said.
His name could not be found on any government lists, such as for paying taxes or receiving social services.
That would no doubt trouble Holocaust survivors and their descendants who have campaigned to have their family treasures returned to them.

When a million people descend on San Francisco in early February for the Super Bowl, they can see a performance by Alicia Keys, a fireworks display and art by local artists.
The free fan village will feature concerts, interactive games and player appearances at the foot of Market Street across from the Ferry Building, and will be among the main images broadcast of San Francisco.
"When a lot of cameras are going to be pointed on the city, they want to have an image of the city that does not include poverty," said Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director at the San Francisco-based Coalition on Homelessness.
The Super Bowl host committee is donating $13 million of the $50 million raised to San Francisco area charities that are mainly aimed at alleviating poverty, said spokesman Nathan Ballard.
"The tremendous safety enhancements that have been made over the past 30 years were put into play in this tragic event," said Larry Rooney, executive vice president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations, a trade association of professional pilots.
"It was a tragic loss of life but nowhere near what you would have anticipated."
The Boeing 777 that crashed July 6 has a record "of being one of the safest airliners in the sky," said Kevin Hiatt, president and chief executive officer of the Flight Safety Foundation.
He now operates AirSafe.com, a Web site that provides information for travelers on safety and security.
The airplane that struck the seawall at San Francisco International Airport, breaking off its tail, had its maiden flight on Feb 5, 2006, so it was manufactured when safety features developed in the late 1980s and 1990s were being incorporated into new airliners.
Firefighters entering the aircraft found the seats toward the front of the aircraft "almost pristine, like you could fluff the pillows and almost go out," National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said in a press briefing.
"In a fire that burns through the top of the aircraft, the heat is extremely intense," said Hiatt of the Flight Safety Foundation, "but if you can slow that down to a point where you can get the aircraft evacuated, it makes all the difference in the world."
In an era when U.S. airline accidents are rare, the crash landing of Asiana Flight 214 has given two decades of safety improvements a chance to demonstrate its worth.
"Accidents are very rare, and this one will be closely looked at," said Todd Curtis, who worked on safety features of the 777 at Boeing.

Acquaintances counseled the professor to keep a low profile, stay away from his university campus and consider taking a vacation abroad, he recalled.
"It is a history ignored, mentioned as part of a plot to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, or as Zionist propaganda with exaggerated figures."
Dajani has advocated publicly for Holocaust education among Palestinians and has devoted part of his own classes to the subject.
The trip to Auschwitz was arranged as part of a reconciliation research project sponsored by the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany, which also included a visit by Israeli students to Deheishe, a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank.
The itinerary included a trip to Krakow, where participants learned about Jewish life before the Holocaust, visiting former Jewish neighborhoods and synagogues.
"I visited the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem three years ago, but here it was different," said Salim Sweidan, a former graduate student at Al Quds who joined the trip.
Nasser al-Qadi, a master\'s degree candidate in American studies at Al Quds, said he\'d joined the trip because it was "our humanitarian duty, regardless of our rift with the Israeli side."
"We went there for education, and we believe that there are no restrictions over education," al Qadi added.
Abdullah Dweikat, a columnist, wrote on the Palestinian news website Watan: "We reject the extermination of any human being because of his religion, nationality or political views, but our humanity also rejects disregarding the wounds and pain of our people, who are being slaughtered every day at the hands of the occupiers.

Dajani said that the treatment of his father and other Arab patients at an Israeli hospital changed his attitude toward Israelis.
These days, municipal authorities are carting off the seaweed to five processing depots, where the water is extracted and the material is dried, then processed into animal feed, fertilizer or a medicinal supplement known as hutai sugar, which is said to help lower blood sugar, according to a report in the Qingdao News.
In the other direction, a backhoe was scooping great piles of it into dump trucks.
On Saturday, Lejun and his 69-year-old grandpa had helped gather globs of it from the sea, plopping it into plastic bags with other volunteers.
One user of the microblog Weibo posted a recipe for a hutai dish that resembled guacamole.
It can be fried with peanuts or shrimp, mixed into spring rolls, or made into pancakes with tofu, egg and flour.

Sen. Rand Paul, the maverick first-term senator who rode a tea party wave from a Kentucky ophthalmology practice to Congress, on Tuesday formally announced a bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
We have come to take our country back!"
Big government and debt doubled under a Republican administration.
"White, black, brown, rich, poor, with tattoos and without tattoos, with earrings and without earrings," Paul told a room packed full of young people in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland.
Paul has been looking to broaden his appeal outside of Washington as well, with some of his more notable libertarian stances inching into more traditionally conservative territory as he prepared to run for president.
He has been meeting with evangelical pastors to woo the faith community in the important states of Iowa and South Carolina; last month, he told a group of pastors that a moral crisis is leading people to believe that same-sex marriage is acceptable.
Paul will publish two books this year: "Taking A Stand" will come out May 26, and "Our Presidents and Their Prayers" will be released in the fall.
"It\'s time for a new way, a new set of ideas, a new leader," Paul said at CPAC in February, in footage he used in a video released Sunday night.

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry released a video purporting to show a truck carrying the Buk missile launcher it said was used to fire on the plane with one of its four missiles apparently missing.
The ministry said the footage was filmed by a police surveillance squad at dawn Friday as the truck was heading to the city of Krasnodon toward the Russian border.
The road into it from Donetsk, the largest city in the region, was marked by five rebel checkpoints, with document checks at each.

Tom Brady has been an NFL golden boy, with movie-star looks, a supermodel wife, four Super Bowl championship rings, and a regular-guy-makes-good back story \u2014 he went from being a sixth-round draft pick to one of the greatest quarterbacks in league history.
The punishment comes days after the league announced results of an investigation that found Brady was "likely generally aware" that equipment assistants employed by the team had conspired to deflate the Patriots\' footballs for last season\'s AFC championship game, making the balls easier to throw and catch.
Brady\'s agent, Don Yee, called the Wells report "an incredibly frail exercise in fact-finding and logic" and said the quarterback would appeal.
Kraft called the investigation "one-sided" and complained that scientific evidence that cold weather accounted for the deflation had been dismissed.
"It\'s a good thing the @nfl suspended Tom Brady now everyone knows that NOBODY is above the system," former NFL linebacker Shawne Merriman wrote on Twitter, concluding with the hashtag #FairGame.
The Patriots have been accused of cheating in the past, and in 2007 were caught breaking league rules by videotaping the sideline hand signals of New York Jets coaches.
That incident, nicknamed Spygate, cost New England coach Bill Belichick $500,000 and the league docked the Patriots a first-round draft pick.
The $1 million fine imposed on the Patriots matches that given to San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo in 1999 for his role in a failed Louisiana riverboat gambling scheme.
However, not all NFL rule breaking results in a substantial penalty.
In 2012, the San Diego Chargers were fined $20,000 for failing to immediately surrender illicit, grip-improving "Stickum" towels when officials asked for them.
"Each player, no matter how accomplished and otherwise respected, has an obligation to comply with the rules and must be held accountable for his actions when those rules are violated and the public\'s confidence in the game is called into question," NFL Executive Vice President Troy Vincent wrote to Brady in a letter explaining the punishment.
This latest scandal comes after the most tumultuous NFL season on record, when the headlines were dominated by the domestic violence incidents involving star running backs Rice and Adrian Peterson.

Brady\'s agent, Don Yee, called the Wells report "an incredibly frail exercise in fact-finding and logic" and said the quarterback would appeal.

In the Deflategate scandal, Brady refused to give investigators access to his email and text messages.
"Each player, no matter how accomplished and otherwise respected, has an obligation to comply with the rules," NFL Executive Vice President Troy Vincent wrote to Brady in a letter explaining the punishment.
To some, that highlighted the arrogance of the Patriots, although others argued both sides.

After considering nearly five months of testimony, a Fulton County jury convicted all but one of the dozen former Atlanta teachers and administrators on trial in the largest test-cheating scandal in the nation.
On Wednesday afternoon, 10 former teachers and school administrators were handcuffed and taken to jail, where they will await sentencing, perhaps to decades in prison.
Two others, including former Superintendent Beverly Hall, died of cancer before they could be tried.
The case capped what began in 2008, when the Atlanta Journal-Constitution broke the first of several stories highlighting suspect test scores in Atlanta Public Schools and other Georgia districts.
Special investigators aided by scores of Georgia Bureau of Investigation agents interviewed hundreds of Atlanta Public Schools employees and obtained admissions of cheating.
The investigative report released in July 2011 concluded that cheating was pervasive and that thousands of schoolchildren were deprived of the education they deserved.
The report said the system was primed for cheating by the severe consequences meted out for failure, including firings, demotions and public humiliation.
"I think every teacher understands now the downsides of bad integrity," he said.
But Richard Quartarone, a father of two students in an Atlanta school, said the verdict brings his city no closer to absolution.
Prosecutors focused on 2009 but said cheating had gone on for years, denying thousands of an education.
Angela Williamson, a former teacher at Dobbs Elementary School in southeast Atlanta who was convicted of prompting kids with correct test answers, could spend the most time in prison.
She was convicted on racketeering and four other counts, more than any of her co-defendants, with the other charges carrying incarceration sentences of five years or more.
Twenty-one others accepted pleas, and many of them testified at trial.
After considering nearly five months of testimony, a Fulton County jury convicted all but one of the dozen former Atlanta teachers and administrators on trial in the largest test-cheating scandal in the nation.
Students in a fourth-grade class at Dobbs Elementary School in southeast Atlanta had a 1 in 288 septillion chance of doing as well as they purportedly did.
"I have always felt the whole thing was tragic," said Erroll Davis, who was interim superintendent between Hall and Carstarphen.
Gerald Griggs said his client, Williamson, the former teacher, whispered to him that she could not believe she had been convicted on all five counts against her.
The Atlanta school system released a statement calling the case a "sad and tragic chapter" that is now over and said Carstarphen and the school board are collaborating to "create a new culture."
After considering nearly five months of testimony, a Fulton County jury convicted all but one of the dozen former Atlanta teachers and administrators on trial in the largest test-cheating scandal in the nation.
A jury convicted 11 former Atlanta teachers and administrators on trial in the largest test-cheating scandal in the nation.
The teachers, principals and their bosses were convicted of changing student test scores to make the district look better.
Many in Atlanta had originally criticized Howard for bringing charges against teachers.
"I have always felt the whole thing was tragic," said Erroll Davis, who served as the superintendent temporarily between Hall and Carstarphen.

A jury convicted 11 former Atlanta teachers and administrators on trial in the largest test-cheating scandal in the nation.
Eleven former Atlanta teachers and administrators were found guilty of cheating and might have to go to prison for decades.
The 11th teacher was at home because she is about to have a baby.
Only one former teacher, Dessa Curb, was found innocent.
The teachers did not just cheat the system.
If students got bad test scores, teachers were fired and embarrassed.
"I have always felt the whole thing was tragic," said Erroll Davis, who replaced Hall as superintendent.
Richard Quartarone is a father of two children in an Atlanta school.
Fulton County Judge Jerry Baxter made it clear he will show little sympathy to the convicted teachers.
They do not reflect the experience of the average family with school-age children."
And, Loveless continues, media reports about increasingly overburdened children are real but atypical.
Some schools have policies, such as the Quaker Valley elementary schools in western Pennsylvania, where kindergarten homework is limited to 10 to 15 minutes a night, growing to 40 to 60 minutes in grade 5.

In the 2012 college freshmen survey, students were asked how much they spent per week on various activities in their last year of high school.
That percentage is less than in 1986, when 49.5 percent of college freshmen said they spent six or more hours a week studying and doing homework in their last year of high school.
"The bottom line: regardless of how the question is posed, NAEP data do not support the view that the homework burden is growing, nor do they support the belief that the proportion of students with a lot of homework has increased in recent years," the Brookings report stated.
Nearly two-thirds said they spent six or more hours a week socializing with friends.
Amma Ababio, of Highland Park, is an 11th-grader at Pittsburgh Allderdice High School who is taking advanced classes.
She figures she does homework from about 5 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. on school nights.

The 2012 college freshmen survey questioned students about their last year of high school.
It also trailed exercise or sports and working for pay.
Back in 1986, the percentage of students who spent at least six hours a week on schoolwork was larger: 49.5 percent.
The percent of students with more than two hours of homework was almost the same in 2012 as it was in 1984.
"The bottom line," Loveless says, is that the "homework burden" does not seem to be growing.
He figures that on schooldays he spends "maybe an hour on homework tops."

And with each double-winning horse who falls short at Belmont Park, known as the "Test of the Champion," the racing community is left to wonder whether the three-race sweep will ever be achieved again.
Trainer Art Sherman said that with all the attention he was getting, he felt like Willie Nelson.
Other trainers with Triple Crown aspirations likely have felt the same.
But Steven Brandt, a Frederick native who owns Preakness entrant Kid Cruz, said horses have changed since Affirmed pulled off the feat.
Coburn lamented that trend after the Preakness, saying, "there are trainers out there that train horses just to upset the apple cart."
"I honestly believe that if the Triple Crown is not won this year by California Chrome, I will never see it in my entire lifetime," California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn said.
I know, right now, we\'re running on a high, but I think when we get to Belmont, this horse is going to run big."
Other trainers with Triple Crown aspirations likely have felt the same.
Several Derby horses skip the Preakness and instead wait for the Belmont to give them a better chance on five weeks of rest.
Coburn lamented that trend after the Preakness, saying, "there are trainers out there that train horses just to upset the apple cart."
As long as they do, there likely will be a large audience for those races at Belmont.
So I think it makes it tougher.
To be a Triple Crown winner, a horse must win three races in the same year \u2014 the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes.
Coburn lamented that trend after the Preakness, saying "there are trainers out there that train horses just to upset the apple cart."
The Triple Crown races are prestigious on their own, but the storylines that develop during Triple Crown season attract casual race fans such as Glenn Moyer.
Since Affirmed last won the Triple Crown in 1978, 12 horses have completed the Derby-Preakness double without adding the third jewel.
California Chrome jockey Victor Espinoza rode War Emblem to victory in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in 2002.
Each time, the racing community is left to wonder whether the three-race sweep will ever be achieved again.
They already have also experienced the pressure of being the Derby winner at Pimlico Race Course.
Owners and trainers prefer more rest for their horses between races.
Horses who run at Churchill Downs and Pimlico also face steeper competition in New York at the Belmont.

A verdict in the city of Jacksonville is again raising the issue of self-defense and race in Florida, just seven months after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin.
Following an argument over loud music coming from the car that Davis was in, Dunn said he shot at the car with his 9 mm handgun \u2014 he said he was afraid and thought he saw a shotgun in the car.
"Although I don\'t think the evidence supports this, it is possible that the jury felt that Dunn was proper to stand his ground as to Davis, but his shooting of the others in the car was excessive," said Kenneth Nunn, a law professor at the University of Florida.
Nunn and other experts said Sunday that it\'s possible the jury was confused regarding first-degree murder and the concept that it must be "premeditated."
But the Florida Supreme Court could reduce the total sentence to 20 years if it decides that consecutive sentences are not appropriate when the sentences arise from one criminal episode, said Weinstein.
Michael Dunn, a white 47-year-old software developer, could face 60 years in prison following his conviction Saturday on multiple counts of attempted murder for shooting into a carful of teenagers outside a Jacksonville convenience store in 2012.
But in each case, jurors were told by the judges that they should acquit if they found the defendant had no duty to retreat and had the right to "stand his ground."
A verdict in the city of Jacksonville is again raising the issue of self-defense and race in Florida, just seven months after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin.
Like Zimmerman, Dunn said he felt his life was in danger when he fired the shots.
Zimmerman told police he shot Martin only after the African-American teenager physically attacked him.
Zimmerman told police he shot Martin only after the African-American teenager physically attacked him.
State laws call for a minimum sentence of 20 years on each second-degree attempted murder conviction.
"I basically told him to stay strong," attorney Cory Strolla said Saturday night, "and we\'re still going to fight."

The shooting came after an argument over loud music coming from the car that Davis was in.
Dunn could agree to  a sentence of less than 60 years and not appeal.

At an emotional briefing Tuesday, staff members from French publication Charlie Hebdo described the motivation behind their latest issue due out Wednesday, the first since the deadly attacks last week on the satirical paper.
Gerard Biard, the editor in chief, said the new edition was produced "with pain and with joy," and noted that 3 million copies will be published in multiple languages, in contrast to the usual run of 60,000 copies per week.
Luzier referred to a firebombing attack on Charlie Hebdo in 2011, saying he chose Muhammad as the subject because "he is a character that got our offices burned, and a character who at first got us treated as the great white knights of the freedom of the press because the offices had burned down.

"This Muhammad is so much nicer than the ones the terrorists brandish," Biard said, holding the cover aloft.
It was one of the few light moments during the emotional briefing, during which Luzier repeatedly choked up and paused, or rubbed tears from his eyes.
"We trust people\'s intelligence, their sense of humor.
People who committed this attack are just people who lack humor," he said.

That also was the day the gunmen who had attacked Charlie Hebdo were killed by police.
Many of his co-workers are still struggling emotionally with what happened, he said.

A evidence shows that a famous ancient skeleton is related to Native Americans living today, scientists announced recently.
The discovery was reported in the scientific journal Nature.
In 2004, after nearly 10 years in court, the tribes ultimately lost and research continued on the bones.
They compared his DNA to sections of DNA of people from Asia and the Americas.
Kennewick Man "shares by far the most with other Native Americans," Rasmussen said.

Astronomers can usually figure out which one it is by measuring how much that distant starlight gets stretched, "redshifted," from higher-energy light such as ultraviolet down to optical and then infrared wavelengths.
To narrow in, they used the MOSFIRE infrared spectrograph at the Keck I telescope in Hawaii to search for a particularly reliable fingerprint of hydrogen in the starlight known as the Lyman-alpha line.
Early galaxies\u2014such as EGS-zs8-1 \u2014 are "probably the source of ultraviolet radiation that ionized the whole universe," Illingworth said.
"Big Hero 6" has been a critical and commercial hit for Walt Disney Animation Studios, winning an Oscar and taking in more than $500 million at the box office.
The software, called Hyperion, simulates the physics of light, which can make animated films more lifelike or give them an otherworldly look.
Disney Animation\'s sister company, Pixar, has long been a trailblazer, producing the first feature-length computer-animated film, 1995\'s "Toy Story."
The metropolis, a mash-up of San Francisco and Tokyo, is situated on a shimmering bay and teems with towering skyscrapers and pulsing neon lights.
The software is now being used by Disney Animation for its forthcoming movie "Zootopia," which will be released in March 2016.
It also was deployed for "Frozen Fever," a short that features the characters of "Frozen" and debuts in March; and "Feast," the Oscar-nominated short that premiered alongside "Big Hero 6."

Emergency-response robots have long suffered from having a range of mobility and dexterity comparable to a 1-year-old child and a level of autonomy generally limited to completing a single task at a time.
Nowhere was this more painfully obvious than in Japan four years ago, after a small squadron of robots was sent to assist workers at the devastated Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.
The machines spent a good deal of time on the sidelines, leaving humans to do the most hazardous work.
The world will see just how far robots have advanced in the subsequent years when the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hosts the final round of a robotics competition aimed at building autonomous machines that can step \u2014 or roll \u2014 in when disasters strike.
A total of 25 international teams will compete June 5 and 6 to win one of three cash prizes totaling $3.5 million.
The course is designed to simulate a disaster area too dangerous for humans to enter.
When robots arrived in Fukushima in March 2011, they found the facility contaminated by radiation and deluged by tons of corrosive seawater.
Responders soon found that the need for radiation shielding on the robots, in combination with other factors, created disruptions in communication that left the machines operating without instruction for periods of time.
"The robots that you\'re going to see at the challenge are very far from fieldable systems" that could be sent into a situation such as earthquake-stricken Nepal, Pratt said.
The development of fully mobile, dexterous, multitasking machines that can serve as fully functioning responders will take many years.

Emergency-response robots have long suffered from having a range of mobility and dexterity comparable to a 1-year-old child and a level of autonomy generally limited to completing a single task at a time.
In addition, they typically can perform just one single task at a time.
Nowhere was this more painfully obvious than in Japan four years ago, after a small squadron of robots was sent to assist workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.
The competition is aimed at building self-contained machines that can step \u2014 or roll \u2014 in when disasters strike.
As an added challenge, DARPA will make sure robots and their operators have a difficult time communicating with each other, to create a scenario closer to the one responders experienced in Japan.
When robots arrived in Fukushima in March 2011, they found the facility contaminated by radiation and filled with tons of damaging seawater.
The previous round of the DARPA Robotics Challenge required robots to press an emergency shutoff switch, get up from a reclined position and travel 10 meters (about 33 feet) without falling.
The final competition will feature similar \u2014 but not the same \u2014 challenges.
"But we know that we have to develop technology to help us to address these kinds of disasters."

As military helicopters ferry search and rescue teams over the Pacific Northwest, below them are scenes of devastation from a giant earthquake that could strike the region at any time.
Federal, state and military officials have been working together to draft plans to be followed when the "Big One" happens.
Ships would likely be needed to assist with the delivery of emergency supplies and to assist with the evacuation of displaced and injured people.
Military and civilian engineers would be sent in to begin repairing an infrastructure that could be shattered in the western \u2014 and most populated \u2014 third of the Pacific Northwest.
Base camps would be set up for emergency responders coming in from across the country, planners say, as well as areas for the distribution of critical supplies such as water, food, tents, blankets and medical supplies.
Seattle, Portland and other urban areas could suffer considerable damage, such as the collapse of structures built before codes were updated to take into account a mega-quake.
Specially trained urban search and rescue teams would be sent to look for survivors in the ruins of destroyed buildings.
As military helicopters ferry search and rescue teams over the Pacific Northwest, below them are scenes of devastation from a giant earthquake that could strike the region at any time.
Emergency medical facilities to treat the injured would be set up because hospitals on the coast would probably be too damaged to use.
Hotels, motels, college dorms, sports arenas and government facilities would be used as temporary shelters for evacuees.
The main coastal highway, U.S. Route 101, would suffer heavy damage from the shaking and from the tsunami.
Traffic on Interstate 5 \u2014 one of the most important thoroughfares in the nation \u2014 would likely have to be rerouted because of large cracks in the pavement.

Still, he said, "it\'s a little unsettling to know that in five minutes I might have to grab that playbook and call the governor," among others.
Buildings, bridges and roads lie in ruins.
Survivors are stranded on rooftops, cling to floating debris or are trapped inside wrecked buildings.
"That playbook is never more than 100 feet from where I am," said Andrew Phelps, director of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management.

Scientists fear the possibility of such scenes and say a great crack in the 650-mile-long offshore fault running from Northern California to British Columbia and the tsunami that follows could come in our lifetime, so emergency officials are busy preparing for the worst.
Federal, state and military agencies are working together to draft plans to be followed when the "Big One" happens.
Since 2013, Braun has led a team working on a military response plan for Washington state that will be coordinated with other government agencies.
Then progressively smaller aircraft would be used to get workers and supplies to smaller airfields close to devastated areas.

When he goes out to dinner, he keeps the playbook in his car.
The planners see the deployment of civilian and military people and equipment that would be greater than any response to any natural disaster that has occurred in the U.S. "The response will be greater than that for Hurricane Katrina or Super Storm Sandy," said Lt. Col. Clayton Braun of the Washington State Army National Guard.
Tens of thousands of soldiers, mortuary teams, police officers, firefighters, engineers and medical workers would be called in.

Then the Alaska nursing home served up musk ox meatloaf to its elderly Inupiat residents and their visiting family members.
"It opens doors for our tribes and their citizens to continue having access to traditional foods," said Leslie Wheelock, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s (USDA) office of tribal relations.
The Birds Springs chapter of the Navajo Nation in Arizona is developing a 20-bed nursing home it hopes to open next year, and the tribe hopes the menu will include elk, deer and other staples like squash and beans from Navajo farmers.
Boosting the new endeavor in Kotzebue, however, is a new plant down the road that is processing and storing the meat of animals donated by local hunters, forging a partnership with the 18-bed nursing home that is unique for the time being.
But it costs up to $100 to purchase a 40-pound case of ground beef, plus 78 cents a pound to fly it from Anchorage, so using ground musk ox or other donated meat instead is expected to add up, officials said.
While many Western foods are picked at or left on plates, subsistence meals tend to be gobbled up, according to Cyrus Harris, whose job with Maniilaq includes hunting for the needs of elders.
Many vacationers will tread on runaway invasive plants, wait in long lines at park entrances and miss out on campfire talks.
Many had to cut staff and shorten hours when state revenues plunged during the recession.
The smaller workforce will result in less frequent mowing, sand-covered bike paths, messier restrooms and fewer interpretive programs.
California was able to keep open all of its 280 state beaches, reserves and parks, thanks to more than $3 million raised by private donor groups and discovery of a misidentified $20.5 million state account.
A new entrance fee \u2014 $10 per day and $30 for an annual pass\u2014has generated only about half of the projected revenue, requiring other reductions to meet the legislature-imposed cuts.
We\'re going to do less with less," said park spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge.
National parks in 2011 generated $13 billion in visitor spending in their nearby communities, supporting 162,400 local jobs, a study commissioned by the Park Service found.
Local businesses from tourism-dependent towns of Jackson and Cody, Wyoming, came to the rescue when Yellowstone National Park officials announced they would wait an extra two weeks to open two snowy park entrances.
The two communities, which reap $334 million a year in spillover economic benefit from 3.6 million Yellowstone visitors, figured the two-week closure could cost them as much as $4 million in lost hotel, restaurant and other revenue.
Yosemite National Park is absorbing much of its $1.8 million reduction by leaving about 20 management vacancies open, said park spokesman Scott Gediman.
To deal with a $359,000 cut, the Gulf Islands National Seashore in Florida and Mississippi will shutter three visitor centers a few days per week and close some restrooms.
Most trash cans are history, replaced by a pack-out-your-own-garbage policy.
Because of a $700,000 cut, Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming has canceled Junior Ranger programs and reduced campfire programs and interpretive walks.
Waits could be longer for medical or accident response and backcountry searches, said spokeswoman Jackie Skaggs.
Almost 8,000 state parks attract more than 741 million visitors a year.
At Grand Canyon National Park, for example, the visitor center will open an hour later and close an hour earlier, and fewer entrance workers will lead to longer lines at the gates.
National parks in 2011 generated $13 billion in visitor spending in their nearby communities, supporting 162,400 local jobs, a study commissioned by the Park Service found.
The chambers of commerce and businesses raised $175,000 for snowplowing to open the roads on time.
Other national parks around the country also have had to make budget-related changes: At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, a $1.2 million cut means that six buildings, including the house where Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, will be closed.
The Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky has absorbed a $324,000 cut by leaving four jobs vacant, including the park electrician.
Long response times for any electric problem deep in the cave means that tours to the remotest sections \u2014 which attracted 28,000 people last year \u2014 will be canceled.
Waits could be longer for medical or accident response and backcountry searches, said spokeswoman Jackie Skaggs.
As for backcountry closures, "We\'ve already started hearing from the people who go there, people who have their beloved secret places," she said.
In states that are still struggling, those cuts have not been reversed.
In a normal summer, the Park Service hires an additional 10,000 people to handle the larger crowds.
But this year, it will reduce that number by 1,000.
It also trimmed 5 percent from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, which helps states fund their state parks.
Four-hundred and one national parks, monuments, battlefields, historic sites, seashores and other national sites could all be affected.

U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday night that recent diplomatic steps offer "the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons" inside Syria without the use of force, but he also insisted the U.S. military will keep the pressure on President Bashar Assad "and be ready to respond" if other measures fail.
But events took another unexpected turn this week.
The president sought to deal methodically with what he said were questions asked by lawmakers and citizens who took the time to write him with their concerns about U.S. military action.
I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo.
Kerry said that any agreement must include binding consequences if Syria fails to comply.
Other casualty estimates are lower.
Earlier, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky became the first congressional leader to come out against legislation giving the president authority for limited strikes.
U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday night that recent diplomatic steps offer "the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons" inside Syria without the use of force, but he also insisted the U.S. military will keep the pressure on President Bashar Assad "and be ready to respond" if other measures fail.
First Russia and then Syria reacted positively to a seemingly off-hand remark from Secretary of State John Kerry.
The president said he was sending Kerry to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday.
Assad has said the attack was launched by rebels who have been fighting to drive him from power in a civil war.
Russia supports Assad and has blocked U.S. attempts to rally the Security Council behind a military strike.
U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday night that poison gas weapons may be able to be removed peacefully from Syria, but he also insisted the U.S. military will keep the pressure on President Bashar Assad "and be ready to respond" if other measures fail.
The military strike would have a clear objective, Obama said.
U.S. officials say more than 1,400 died in the Aug. 21 incident.
Other death estimates are lower.
In Easton, Md., an untold story of free African-Americans is being discovered through bits of glass, shards of pottery and oyster shells.
Former slaves founded such settlements, where they enjoyed early emancipation and the chance at property ownership and commerce.
Other artifacts include bits of a blue opaline glass pitcher from the 1800s and a 1-cent coin featuring Lady Liberty, dated 1794.
More importantly, researchers have found evidence of making nails and raising chickens on the land \u2014 activities far more likely to have been carried out by free blacks who lived on the land than by the property owner.
Priscilla Morris, whose family has roots in Easton dating to the 1600s, is a regular visitor to the site.
"Nobody ever told us there was this extraordinary, large, free community."
In Easton, Md., an untold story of free African-Americans is being discovered through bits of glass, shards of pottery and oyster shells.

In Easton, Maryland, an untold story of free African-Americans is being dug right out of the ground.
During the first census in 1790, some 410 free African-Americans were recorded living on The Hill.
Woehlke showed off part of an olive-green glass bottle, decorated with cluster of grapes, that he said was probably used to hold wine.
Since the dig began, more than 500 people have visited.
Some have come on organized tours, but others have just wandered in after seeing "public archaeology excavation" signs posted around the block.
Priscilla Morris has family roots in Easton that date back to the 1600s, and she is a regular visitor to the site.
She said she finds the dig "thrilling" because no one quite knows or understands how people lived at The Hill two hundred years ago.
Most written histories skip over the experiences of free African-Americans, said Morris.
Morris explained that in the past, history was always told by slave owners rather than African-Americans.
In Easton, Maryland, an untold story of free African-Americans is being dug right out of the ground.
They are working in 5-by-5-foot squares, and the deeper they dig, the further back in history they go.

In Easton, Maryland, a new history about African-Americans is being dug right out of the ground.
He said that this project is not just a story about black people.
In communities like The Hill, they had the freedom to own property and trade goods.
This is much more than the 250 free African-Americans who lived in the port city of Baltimore at the time.
He believes it was made in the late 18th or early 19th century.
The diggers also found a 1-cent coin featuring Lady Liberty, dated 1794.
Professor Green said that the free African-Americans lived alongside white families at The Hill.
Records show that Price and three free African-Americans lived on the property.

Christmas gifts of years gone by meet a sad end at Absolute Green Electronics Recycling in California.
Computers are dismantled, the parts sorted into cardboard bins.
There are bins for cellphones, VHS camcorders, digital cameras, cables and network switches.
"Everything gets separated," Kianipay said.
Those substances are released when the waste is melted down to recover gold, silver and copper.
Spurred by environmental activists, Congress and state governments are trying to ensure that e-waste gets properly recycled here.
More than 1.5 billion pounds of video-display equipment has been collected directly because of the law since 2005, Oldfield said.
Industrial-scale shredders turn circuit boards and hard drives into huge bits of glass, metal and plastics.
"There are no smelters that do this in the U.S.," due to the environmental effects of the smelting process, Smith said.
But, environmentalists fear they are only losing ground because of the astonishing explosion of devices.
Corrosion, degradation and decay destroy a lot of history, but Massachusetts officials can thank the elements for helping uncover the past.
The copper or tin box, which measures 5-by-7 inches, was mortared into the cornerstone, which officials recently decided to remove while trying to prevent water from seeping into the aging statehouse.
One reporter on the scene for WBZ NewsRadio reported Thursday that several dimes from 1854 fell out of the cornerstone as workers tapped their way inside.
Less than half a mile away stands the Old State House, the oldest surviving public building in Boston, built in 1713.
A time capsule was recovered there three months ago.
Lion and unicorn statues on the building as a symbol of British rule were torn down and destroyed in a fire, said Heather Leet, director of development at the Bostonian Society, which was founded to restore the Old State House.
But the harsh harbor winds whipping down State Street forced officials to replace the replacements in 1901, with a silver-enameled unicorn and a gold-enameled lion, both made of copper, Leet said.
Those statues had to be restored after decades of punishment from those same New England winds, Leet said.
The Bostonian Society took suggestions from the city and beyond, then created a new Boston-centric time capsule for 2014.

My parents never took interest in my schooling," said Robinson.
"She wanted to believe what she said more than anybody but lacked a lot of the confidence in following what she knew what she wanted to do."
The youngest child by 27 years, though she grew up with both her parents in the Central District of Seattle, hers was hardly an ideal childhood.
Said Schloss: "If they are not attending school or their grades are low, or if they don\'t have enough credits, if they are not connected to their communities or schools, the dropout rate goes through the roof."
"My main focus was my parents and which, honestly, as a kid it shouldn\'t have been, but my main focus was like, wanting them to do what they had to do so I could go back home with them," she said.
"She was able to start connecting her high school graduation to her goals; she really was able to start to see how some of those classes she didn\'t like, like math and science, were necessary for her to get what she wanted.
Not like a real career," she said.

There are signs that many foreign fans are staying away, turned off by terrorist threats, expensive flights and hotels, long travel distances, a shortage of tourist attractions in the area, and the hassle of obtaining visas and spectator passes.
Sochi officials have refused to divulge how many tickets in total were put up for sale, saying the figure would only be released after the games.
By comparison, 1.54 million tickets were available for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and 97 percent (1.49 million) were sold.
Heiberg, who chairs the IOC marketing commission, said the Russians have cut down by 50 percent on the number of spectators originally planned for the mountain events for security reasons.
said Sochi resident Yana Ivolovskaya, who bought two tickets for bobsled for 2,000 rubles ($60).
Fans outside Russia buy tickets from authorized dealers appointed by their national Olympic committees.
Attracting foreign visitors has been a challenge amid all the headlines about Russia\'s law banning gay "propaganda," human rights issues and \u2014 particularly \u2014 the risk of terrorism.
Back-to-back suicide bombings killed 34 people last month in Volgograd, about 400 miles (640 kilometers) from Sochi.
"They had to get out their atlases."
"Some people are scared it costs too much and other people are scared because of security," senior International Olympic Committee member Gerhard Heiberg of Norway told The Associated Press.
Sochi organizers announced last week that 70 percent of tickets have been sold for the games, which run from Feb. 7-23 and represent a symbol of pride and prestige for Russia and President Vladimir Putin.
However, according to IOC marketing documents seen by the AP, Sochi had a total of 1.1 million tickets on offer.
That would mean about 300,000 tickets remained available.
Heiberg organized the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics, which stood out for the colorful atmosphere generated by passionate Norwegian fans.

"I expect it to be orange," Jeroen de Roever, manager of official Duch ticket seller ATPI, said of Sochi\'s speedskating venue.
Of course, there will be Norwegians there but not as many as we are used to."
More than half of all tickets cost less than 5,000 rubles ($150).
Many, however, complained that all the cheap tickets were already gone.
Die-hard winter sports fans, however, will not be discouraged.
They are turned off by a number of reasons: terrorist threats, expensive flights and hotels, long travel distances, a shortage of tourist attractions, and the hassle of obtaining visas and spectator passes.

That means there will be fewer people and probably less excitement than in Lillehammer, he said.
After years of prayers by Catholic nuns and controversy among Native American groups, Pope Francis announced Thursday that Junipero Serra, the Spanish priest who founded the string of California missions, will be canonized in September as a saint.
"Pope Francis is from Argentina and knows the history of the New World," Lopez said Thursday.

"But maybe he thinks it\'s more important that he brought Christianity to the New World than what happened to the native population.
Becoming a saint in the Roman Catholic Church is a long process with multiple steps.
Many Native Americans put to work by the Spanish died of European diseases, including chicken pox and measles, because they had never been exposed to them before, and had no immunity.
Castillo said it was outrageous that the Catholic Church, which has apologized for how the Indians were treated, would now "canonize one of their great monsters."
It was very intense," said Senkewicz, who co-authored a biography on Serra.

"It definitely feels different," said Navarro, of North Philadelphia, who was 11 when she emigrated from Honduras.
The story began in the Honduran countryside.
For Turcios and her husband, a machine operator, it was a chance to formalize their status through temporary protection offered to immigrants who are in the United States during such catastrophes in their home countries.
So, in 2002, she and her husband decided to send for her children to have them smuggled across the border for a shot at a better life.
Most of her siblings entered undetected, but one of her sisters traveling separately was not so fortunate.
"I didn\'t decide to come here, and many times I wished I hadn\'t come, because of all the pressure and the feeling of having no freedom at all and not being able to go anywhere or have the same future as the rest of my friends, or go to the same schools \u2014 having to work twice as hard just to go to a two-year college," she said.
Previously, undocumented individuals accused of any violation could be held in Philadelphia jails for immigration purposes.
For Sara Navarro, being undocumented used to feel a lot like being hunted.

The program protected from deportation some immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally by their parents before age 16.
"It definitely feels different," said Navarro, of North Philadelphia, who was 11 when she arrived here from Honduras.
Some of her relatives are U.S. citizens or have what is called temporary protected status, which protects them from being deported.
The proposed federal law would increase legal immigration, decrease illegal immigration and let a certain number of illegal immigrants who are already here stay permanently and begin earning the requirements needed to become a citizen.
So, in 2002, she and her husband decided to send for their children and had them smuggled across the border for a shot at a better life.
Most of her siblings entered undetected, but one of her sisters traveling separately was stopped at the border.
The rest of the family moved, and then moved again, trying to stay ahead of government authorities.
Although Turcios says she still lives in fear, the Philadelphia city government said its police cannot work with federal immigration authorities.
For Sara Navarro, being an undocumented immigrant used to feel a lot like being hunted.
Navarro felt hopeless, she said, because she had no way of staying here legally and considered dropping out of school.

They were waiting on this wind-swept tarmac at the company\'s plant in Palmdale, Calif., to catch a glimpse of the aircraft nicknamed "Lazarus" \u2014 the plane that died in a fire on the island of Guam only to be resurrected.
Many of them, mechanics such as Byrne, left their families in Palmdale and flew 6,000 miles to Guam to work seven days a week for months at a time to restore the stealth bomber.
\u2014\u2014\u2014 The military is quick to say that the B-2 is unlike any other aircraft in the U.S. arsenal.
Because of its stealth characteristics, it is the first bomber to be sent into heavily defended enemy territory to clear the way for other fighters and bombers by knocking out anti-aircraft batteries and radar installations.
It summoned the expert mechanics, engineers and other technicians from the company that know the bomber best.
Every seven years, the planes fly into the facility for a massive overhaul.
I had to look it up on a map and saw this tiny dot in the middle of the Pacific."
"The extent of the damage was surprising," said David G. Mazur, Northrop\'s vice president of long-range strike operations.
Last year alone, the Air Force spent more than $1.2 billion upgrading, maintaining and overhauling the fleet.
For each hour a B-2 was in the air, it spent 47 hours on the ground undergoing maintenance.
A B-2 mechanic has 750 technical manuals to reference to fix the plane.
Rebuilding the bomber depended on parts that were difficult to find; some components were discovered on shelves at air bases in the U.S. Parts that were no longer made were expensive to remake based on blueprints that were drawn when mechanics such as Byrne and McElhaney were in grade school.
It summoned the expert mechanics, engineers and other technicians from the company that know the bomber best.
Hundreds of parts would have to be replaced."
Once there, the aircraft would undergo a complete restoration at a cost of about $37.2 million.
The repairs required more than 1,000 parts ranging in size from small clips to massive sections that support the structure of the aircraft.
On Guam, Northrop determined it would do the repair in two phases.
The plane, formally dubbed Spirit of Washington, started right up on the first attempt.
It was early morning in the Mojave Desert when Sean Byrne noticed a black dot flying just above the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.
The project took nearly four years and cost more than $105 million.
All that attention to detail paid off as the plane, named Spirit of Washington, started right up on the first attempt.

The Air Force had lost another plane when a B-2 crashed and burned in 2008.
It called on expert mechanics, engineers and other technicians from the company who know the bomber best.
In May 2010, Byrne and five other mechanics flew to the island to look at the aircraft, which was sitting in a hangar.
All that attention to detail paid off as the plane, named Spirit of Washington, started right up on the first attempt.
It is a huge plane that can carry more than 20 tons of bombs and is almost undetectable by radar.
On Feb. 26, 2010, a B-2 attempted to take off from Guam, a Pacific Island south of Japan, for a routine training mission.
That was good news because the Air Force had already lost a B-2 when one crashed and burned in 2008.
So when the Air Force decided to rebuild the plane on Guam, it looked for experts from Northrop.
They spent so much time working on the island, they started calling their temporary home "Guamdale."

The B-2 bomber is one of the rarest and most expensive planes in the U.S. Air Force.
On Feb. 26, 2010, a B-2 was taking off from Guam, a small Pacific island south of Japan, for a training mission.

Indian adults are twice as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes as the general population, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Lori Watso, a former public health nurse and Shakopee tribe member, was the inspiration for the expansive garden and natural health store established on tribal land in Prior Lake, Minnesota.
Reversing that trend remains a formidable challenge.
"It\'s very difficult to change people\'s minds about something so personal as (the food) they\'re going to put into their bodies," said Watso, secretary-treasurer of the tribe\'s business council.
Far from the wide open spaces and roaming goats in Shakopee, urban farmers at Little Earth in Minneapolis work a tiny strip of once-vacant land bordered by the Hiawatha Avenue sound wall.
They add fertile soil donated by the Shakopee tribe, which also shares seeds and best practices with this small community.
She hopes one day the urban farm will become fully sustainable.
If these goals are going to be achieved, Little Earth will need the help of avid urban farmers like George Lussier.
In New Mexico, indigenous food programs are working to preserve seeds from hundreds of years ago.
Once harvested, the fruits and vegetables are dispersed among Shakopee tribe members as well as other Indian communities.
The ground is contaminated, they say, so the Little Earth farmers use wood chips mixed in compost to create the raised beds.

In Sunnyvale, California, a team of elder Silicon Valley scientists is building a bold new device.
The team is made up of retired physicists, engineers, chemists and computer experts from some of the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, an area of California near San Francisco, known for high-tech companies like Apple and Google.
Foster says they would like to have something available though, "so we know what works and what doesn\'t work."
"Personally, I doubt that the world is ready for this," said Stephen Gardiner, a University of Washington professor who studies the ethics of environmental policies.

"As one family member has said, this is long overdue," Obama told the single largest group of Medal of Honor recipients since 1945.
"I\'m busting with pride," said Charles Baldonado, 77, whose brother Joe R. Baldonado was among those honored posthumously.
The recipients included non-Latino and non-Jewish veterans after the review turned up other recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest military decoration, who the Pentagon said deserved the Medal of Honor, which has been awarded to more than 3,400 people since it was established during the Civil War.
The president singled out Florida resident Mitch Libman, who was in attendance, for helping inspire the congressionally ordered review by trying to find out for decades why his childhood friend Pfc.
John "Mac" MacFarland, a Vietnam veteran who in 1969 wrote the recommendation nominating Erevia for the Medal of Honor and was long haunted by the belief that it was his fault that Erevia didn\'t receive it, said he watched the ceremony over C-SPAN.
It took decades, congressional legislation and a review of thousands of war records, but two dozen veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam received the Medal of Honor on Tuesday from President Barack Obama at a somber and tearful White House ceremony.
Rodela and Santiago Jesse Erevia, both of San Antonio, and Melvin Morris of Port St. John, Fla., served in Vietnam and took turns standing by Obama as a military officer read aloud the citations.
Erevia, the retired postal worker, choked up when the president asked him, Rodela and Morris to return to the stage together to thank them "on behalf of a grateful nation."
It took decades, congressional legislation and a review of thousands of war records, but two dozen veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam received the Medal of Honor on Tuesday from President Barack Obama at a somber and tearful White House ceremony.
They included three living honorees: a 68-year-old retired postal worker, a 72-year-old retired salesman and great-grandfather, and a 76-year-old retiree who the president noted enjoys mowing the grass for his neighbors.
"Jose is such a humble guy," Obama said of Jose Rodela, "that he did not even mention this ceremony to his neighbors, who I think would be pretty shocked to turn on the news tonight and see that the guy who cuts their lawn is getting the Medal of Honor."
He also called family members of recipients who had died.

"We are making sure that we have options for those who are homeless to move into an emergency shelter, and the biggest deficit in the system is shelter space for families," Ige said.
The new transitional shelter the state is envisioning would house about 15 families at a time, Morishige said.
Two of the sites under consideration are in Kakaako, the neighborhood where the large homeless encampment was cleared, and the other sites are in Liliha and near Sand Island.
The recent clearing of the Kakaako homeless encampment could be used as a model in other parts of the state, Ige said.
By coordinating with service providers, more than half of the estimated 300 residents of the encampment, including 25 families, were moved into shelters and permanent housing, the governor said.

Many homeless people move from colder states to Hawaii where it is warm and they can sleep on the beach.
At the rim of the Grand Canyon, busloads of Chinese tourists jostled on a recent day with 20-something backpackers and an Amish family with rambunctious boys in suspenders and straw hats, all eager for a prime viewing spot.
The first would alter the natural beauty of the canyon and encroach on its borders.
The second, a major housing and commercial development, jeopardizes the fragile ecology and water supply on the arid South Rim plateau.
Federal jurisdiction extends a quarter-mile on either side of the Colorado, the park says, and no development can occur any closer to the water.
"That kind of water just isn\'t around there," said Uberuaga.
The park has a stash of 13 million gallons in storage tanks on the South Rim, about an 18-day supply.
And half of that must be kept in reserve for fire protection.
The Grand Canyon affords once-in-a-lifetime views, but it has always been difficult for anyone except seasoned hikers to reach the canyon floor.
We want them to feel the canyon from the bottom."
When water in the tanks drops to half of capacity, said Tim Jarrell, the park\'s chief of maintenance, "we start to think about cutting back on the number of people we let in the park."
At the rim of the Grand Canyon, busloads of Chinese tourists jostled on a recent day with 20-something backpackers and an Amish family with rambunctious boys in suspenders and straw hats, all eager for a prime viewing spot.
Most of the 5 million annual visitors stop at the rim, look out and move on without ever venturing into the canyon.
But the plans do not say where the water will come from.
When water in the tanks drops to half of capacity, said Tim Jarrell, the park\'s chief of maintenance, "we start to think about cutting back on the number of people we let in the park."
Together they are seen as the most serious threat the park has faced in its 95-year history.
A development of that size that close to the park, he said, would seriously "impact our visitor experience."
The proposed Grand Canyon Escalade gondola would afford an opportunity for tourists to reach the canyon floor.
That\'s where he resides \u2014 if there is a development there, where are our prayers going to go?"
They expect it to diminish the small amount of water found naturally on the dry Colorado Plateau.
"That kind of water just isn\'t around there," Uberuaga said.
For now, the park is waiting for the tribe to complete its planning process.
As it is, there is already hardly enough water.
However, it has always been difficult for anyone except seasoned hikers to reach the canyon floor.
When water levels drop, said park official Tim Jarrell, "we start to think about cutting back on the number of people we let in the park."
But the encounter also has many questioning why a police officer was needed in the first place.
Since the 1990s, educators and parents have demanded "zero tolerance" policies in response to school shootings, drugs and gang tensions.
And infractions that once resulted in detention may now leave students with criminal records \u2014 a phenomenon that critics say disproportionately affects African-American students.
There are no national standards for training school police, according to Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers, the name typically given to school police.
Lott said South Carolina\'s disturbing-school law makes it a misdemeanor "to interfere with or to disturb in any way or in any place the students or teachers of any school or college in this state," which could apply to a broad range of behavior.
At least three students who were in the classroom at Spring Valley High said the teacher tried to discipline the unidentified student for looking at her phone.
The deputy then wraps his arm around her neck from behind in a headlock and tries to lift the student by one of her legs.
The deputy drags the first student, who is still entangled in the desk, and throws her across the classroom, the two videos show.
When officers are well trained and work closely with school officials, arrests in schools go down rather than up, he said.
Lott said his office will also look at when it is proper to call in a resource officer.
In one video, the deputy can be seen telling the student sitting at her desk, "You either come with me, or I\'m going to make you."

A Justice Department report released Wednesday accused the Ferguson Police Department and courts of unfairly targeting African-Americans, searching people without probable cause, abusing authority and routinely violating civil rights.
Will leaders agree to make the more than two dozen changes the Justice Department recommended?
On Tuesday, three federal Department of Justice officials went over the report with top Ferguson officials.
In one of those, a 32-year-old black man was sitting in a car after playing basketball.
One of them depicted President Barack Obama as a chimpanzee.
But "the cost of not doing this, not just monetarily, but otherwise, are pretty severe," a Justice Department official said.
If so, the discovery could change our understanding of the neurological mechanisms behind some thought processes.
It is also believed that the two hemispheres of the cortex set apart creative thinkers (the "right-brained") from logical thinkers (the "left-brained").
Reiss, inspired by the game Pictionary, developed an experiment.
The results were surprising: the prefrontal cortex, traditionally associated with thinking, was most active for the drawings the participants ranked as most difficult; the cerebellum was most active for the drawings the participants scored highest on for creativity.
If the cerebellum plays a role in creativity, it could alter our understanding of how the brain functions.
The traditional belief that the cerebellum is involved only in motor control stems from studies in monkeys.
The studies indicate that it is separate structure at the base of the brain that is not connected to the rest of the brain.
Reiss, inspired by the game Pictionary, developed an experiment.
Participants in the study were placed into a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine, or fMRI.
Essentially, the less the participants thought about what they were drawing, the more creative their drawings were.
Then it will have advanced our understanding of the cognitive neuroscience of creativity and other forms of higher cognition.
Essentially, the less the participants thought about what they were drawing, the more creative their drawings were.
Most frustrating of all, the more effort and thought we put into it, the harder it becomes.
Now at least, neuroscientists who study the brain might have found a clue about why it is so difficult to force that creative spark.
It suggests that the cerebellum, the brain region typically known for controlling muscles and movement, is also involved in creativity.
Reiss, inspired by the word game Pictionary, developed an experiment.
While inside the machine, the participants were asked to draw a series of pictures based on action words like vote, exhaust and salute.
Even more surprisingly, the cerebellum was most active for the drawings the participants scored highest on for creativity.
If the cerebellum plays a role in creativity, it could change our understanding of how the brain works.
However, it increased when the task required little conscious thought.
Future experiments should attempt to match the creative tasks more closely with the control.
This supports the theory that the cerebellum works in cognition in much the same way it works in motor control.
Future experiments should attempt to match the creative tasks more closely with the control.
Scientists at Stanford University recently set out to explore creativity in the brain.
If so, the discovery could change our understanding of the way the brain works.
Hawthorne wanted to measure whether or not her design class made students more creative.
While inside the machine, they were asked to draw pictures based on action words like vote, exhaust and salute.
Basically, the less the participants thought about what they were drawing, the more creative their drawings were.
Future experiments should attempt to match the tasks more closely with the control.
Scientists hope the Stanford experiment can be improved and repeated.
And yet every two to three years, sea turtles dig their nests at the same location where they once crawled out of their own leathery eggs \u2014 a behavior known as natal homing.
"Most likely they have tiny magnetic particles in their brains or in their bodies that act like a compass, but conclusive evidence is lacking," Brothers said.
Brothers also noted that while loggerhead turtles may use geomagnetic fields to help them get back home to lay their eggs, it does not appear they are relying on the information alone.
And yet every two to three years, sea turtles dig their nests at the same location where they once crawled out of their own leathery eggs \u2014 a behavior known as natal homing.
It is a mystery that has stumped scientists for decades: How do female sea turtles manage to navigate back to the same beach where they were hatched when it comes time to lay their own eggs?
It is vast and featureless \u2014 and yet every two to three years, sea turtles dig their nests at the same location where they once crawled out of their own eggs.
One pole \u2014 the North Pole \u2014 is in the Arctic, while the other \u2014 the South Pole \u2014 is in Antarctica.
When sailors and other travelers use a compass to find north, they rely on geomagnetism.
Because the bar continuously shifts a bit, its angle relative to the Earth changes over time.
The difference in the degree to which they are attracted to the magnet is part of their magnetic signature.
For example, researchers do not know what the turtles are using to detect the geomagnetic field, which can neither be seen nor heard.
It is a mystery that has stumped scientists for decades: How do female sea turtles manage to navigate back to the same beach where they were hatched when it comes time to lay their own eggs?
However, there are still many more questions to be answered.
"If a condo is built there, they will usually decide to go nest somewhere else."
It is a mystery that has stumped scientists for years: How do female sea turtles navigate back to the beach where they were born when it comes time to lay their own eggs?
Geomagnetism is an invisible but powerful force.
Everything on Earth reacts to geomagnetism in a different way, and the particular way each thing reacts is known as its magnetic signature.
It proved that sea turtles can sense magnetic signatures.
An Oregon teenager contracted the bubonic plague last month.
Authorities believe a flea infected a girl during a mid-October hunting trip.
The first was the Justinian Plague, which began in 541 A.D. and was named for Byzantine Emperor Justinian I.
It was during that pandemic that scientists discovered that the plague was caused by a bacteria and often spread through fleas.

An Oregon teenager contracted the bubonic plague last month.
No new cases of the disease have been discovered since then.
The disease is certainly not common, however, as Oregon has had only eight cases of plague over the past 20 years.
In the United States overall, there were only 1,006 cases of plague between 1900 and 2012, most of them of the bubonic variety.
When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria can invade the bloodstream.
The final major outbreak is known as the Modern Plague.
It was during that outbreak that scientists discovered the plague was caused by a bacteria and often spread through fleas.
The terrible disease killed about 50 million Europeans during the 1300s.

Close calls with crocodiles, a brutal civil war and even the death of a fellow traveler have not deterred a British man from attempting to walk the length of the Nile River.
"We\'ve had some close calls with buffalo, elephants and very close call with a crocodile in Murchison Falls," a national park in Uganda, he said Thursday.
Another South Sudanese man on a bike ferries supplies.
"And when I set off on Nov. 25 I obviously didn\'t predict a civil war kicking off mid-December."
"As that\'s the front line, I\'ll have to make a decision when I get there whether I have to move away from the river," he said.

The 31-year-old said it took three years to plan the walk from Rwanda to Egypt.
The 31-year-old Wood said it took three years to plan the walk, which stretches all the way from Rwanda to Egypt.
The toughest challenge, though, is keeping up the pace and not getting "too dismayed when there are delays."
Close calls with crocodiles, a brutal civil war and even the death of a fellow traveler have not stopped a British man from pursuing his goal: walking the entire length of the Nile River.

In addition to learning and homework, more and more schools across the country have started handing out something else to students: breakfast.
However, researchers who study how different animals drink water are learning that dogs might actually have a clever strategy all their own.
Different animals have distinct strategies when it comes to getting a mouthful of water, according to research co-author Sunghwan Jung, an assistant professor at Virginia Tech University.
Carnivores, including animals from the canine and feline families such as wolves and lions, do not have complete cheeks.
So instead of sucking up water, carnivores have to use their tongues to lap at liquid and bring it toward their mouths.
Then they quickly move their tongue upward over and over again, each time pulling a stream of water up into the air.
Dogs are not known as being the most graceful drinkers.
Snow-covered roads, high winds and ice made travel treacherous Sunday from the Dakotas to Missouri to Delaware ahead of a "polar vortex" that will bring below-zero temperatures not seen in years to much of the nation.
The counterclockwise-rotating pool of cold, dense air will affect more than half of the continental U.S. Sunday through Tuesday.
With it comes a startling forecast: 25 degrees Fahrenheit below zero in Fargo, N.D., minus 31 in International Falls, Minn., and 15 below in Indianapolis and Chicago.
Five to 7 inches fell overnight in the Chicago area, while 8 to 10 inches of snow was expected to fall in central Illinois, Indiana and Michigan later Sunday, National Weather Service meteorologist Ed Fenelon said.
In Chicago, temperatures were expected to fall throughout Sunday to about 11 degrees by 5 p.m., "and from there it will be a free fall for the rest of the night," with temperatures bottoming out around minus 15, Fenelon said.
In western Kentucky, Smithland farmer David Nickell moved extra hay to the field and his animals out of the wind.
The 2009 ice storm that paralyzed the state and knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people was fresh in his mind.

"It\'s just a dangerous cold," National Weather Service meteorologist Butch Dye said.
Several states in the Midwest were getting walloped with up to a foot of new snow.
Residents shoveled out and stocked up on groceries before bitterly cold temperatures set in overnight.
Hypothermia is a dangerous medical condition where your body looses heat faster than it can replace the heat, according to the Mayo Clinic.
Michigan residents had also jammed stores to stock up on supplies.

A 14-year-old Muslim student will face no criminal charges for taking a homemade clock to class that his suburban Dallas high school teachers thought resembled a bomb, the police chief said Wednesday.
On Monday, he wanted to show his work to his engineering teacher but was warned to keep the clock in his backpack.
He was then escorted from the school in handcuffs for further questioning by the police.
School district spokeswoman Lesley Weaver declined to confirm the suspension, citing privacy laws.
This spring, the city council endorsed one of several bills under discussion in the Texas Legislature that would forbid judges from rulings based on "foreign laws" \u2014 legislation opponents view as unnecessary and driven by anti-Muslim sentiment.
One woman declared, "Shariah law is Islam, and Islam\'s goal is to immigrate, assimilate and annihilate."
"This all raises a red flag for us: how Irving\'s government entities are operating in the current climate," Alia Salem, executive director of the council\'s North Texas chapter, told the Morning News.
Boyd said the clock that Ahmed built looked "suspicious in nature," but that he considers the case closed.
In a tweet posted Wednesday, Obama called Ahmed\'s clock "cool" and said more kids should be inspired like him to enjoy science, because "it\'s what makes America great."
Ahmed\'s father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, earlier told the Morning News that his son "just wants to invent good things for mankind.
Boyd said police have an "outstanding relationship" with the Muslim community in Irving and that he would meet the boy\'s father on Wednesday to address any concerns.

President Barack Obama said Monday the deaths of unarmed black men in Missouri and New York show that law enforcement needs to change practices to build trust in minority communities, as a White House task force called for independent investigations when police use deadly force.
The panel also met with leaders of groups advocating for the rights of blacks, Hispanics, Asians, veterans, gays, the disabled and others.
"I think it helps to drive a wedge between a local police department and the community it serves \u2014 which is exactly contrary to what the intent of this police task force was supposed to be," said Johnson, whose organization is an umbrella group of police unions.
But the task force found that the cameras raise extraordinarily complex legal and privacy issues.
"It takes time, it takes relationship-building and it doesn\'t happen overnight," she said.

Chadwick admitted that people think of cricket as a game played only by wealthy gentlemen.
But cricket began very differently: The game was originally played by ordinary people, not noblemen.
The idea was to point out the religious and educational value of sports.
"Because it\'s been in permafrost up until now, the level of preservation is just marvelous," he said.
Here, however, excavators have found intact wooden masks, bowls, bows, arrows and spears.
There\'s been so little archaeology in Yup\'ik country that everything we find here is a revelation."
Knecht said the dates of the objects are important, because they bracket a particularly intense chill in the so-called Little Ice Age, an abrupt period of colder-than-usual temperatures and ice advances recorded from 1430 to 1455.
The destruction was well documented in court records in Europe and Asia.
"From this site we can learn a huge amount about how people lived before and after the ecosystems changed."
Yet they were also old.
"This is easily the largest collection of pre-contact Yup\'ik material anywhere," Knecht said, thousands of items dating from between 1350 and 1670.
Here, however, excavators have found intact wooden masks, bowls, bows, arrows and spears.
Some unfamiliar items washed up on the beach near the village of Quinhagak on the Bering Sea in Western Alaska about five years ago.
The mystery of where these items came from and why they were in such good condition just had to be investigated.
Warren Jones is the general manager of Qanirtuuq Inc., a company which runs a grocery store in Quinhagak and helps promote the village.
The first test holes were dug in 2009 and they were small, at about six feet across.
In August, between 15 and 20 volunteers from all around the world joined Quinhagak residents in a "field school" to excavate the site that now stretches for about 150 yards.
Professor Knecht is excited by what the team has found.

"I\'ve got all kinds of goodies in back of my plane," Rork said from his home in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
His last flight in March included 30 small dogs traveling from Arizona to an animal shelter in Idaho.
"Sending them someplace where they might not have as many Chihuahuas certainly means they\'ll get adopted a lot quicker than they would if they stayed here."
Judy Zimet is a Phoenix attorney who also serves as the executive director of Dog Is My CoPilot.
Since the organization was founded two years ago, Rork has flown more than 1,000 animals to no-kill shelters in other states.
How the breeds are selected from the shelters comes down to supply and demand, Zimet said.
Maricopa County sends many small breeds to out-of-state rescue groups.
"Before we were bringing dogs, people would go to the shelter and they wouldn\'t find what they wanted and they\'d end going to the puppy mills or they\'d go on Craigslist or to breeders," she said.
"I think it really kicked into high gear after Hurricane Katrina," Nienstedt said in a telephone interview.

It opened his eyes to the world of high-tech work.
"Siemens is three minutes from my house, and I didn\'t know it existed," Rucker-Shivers said, marveling at the opportunities nearby.
Rucker-Shivers and Bailey have been calibrating machines and writing up instructions for various jobs.
Instead of having to borrow for a traditional college education \u2013 "student loans are a killer"\u2013 he would get a free education and near-certain employment.
Bosch staff will not discuss pay, but Realon says a national report shows machinist technicians can earn $60,000 to $100,000 a year.
By springtime, a lot of high school seniors are cruising to the end of school.
Rucker-Shivers knew he enjoyed working with this hands.
At the math/science school, which Rucker-Shivers attends, the themes are energy and engineering.
"Siemens is three minutes from my house, and I didn\'t know it existed," Rucker-Shivers said, marveling at the opportunities nearby.
Five out of 10 summer interns were offered apprenticeships, but not Rucker-Shivers, who learned another lesson.
Meanwhile, Rucker-Shivers recently got good news about his own economic future.
His class work at Olympic High School in Charlotte, N.C., and his after-school job at nearby Bosch Rexroth Corp. are preparing him to work with machines.
The future of public education may look a lot like what Rucker-Shivers is doing right now.
It starts with an online assessment of their skills and interests.
It is sort of like online job "dating."
Advisers from private industry help educators create classes to prepare students for skilled jobs.

Now a few high school students also get a chance.
He found belt buckles, revolvers, bayonets, unexploded artillery shells \u2014 even a carved bullet that may have been used as a chess piece.
It started on Oct. 21, 1864, east of Independence and progressed along the Blue River and into what is now Loose Park, near Brush Creek, before turning south.
The Monnett Fund had obtained only a modest collection of Battle of Westport artifacts.
George also showed Smith perhaps his most evocative artifact \u2014 a French-made revolver that had been found not in the ground but in an interior wall of an Adams family barn in the late 19th century.
He wishes he could retire, but he and his 61-year-old wife depend on the $50 a month they earn from the shop.
I\'m scared of thinking of being sick \u2014 I don\'t know how I can pay for the medical care."
The report fits into an increasingly complex picture of aging and what it means to the world.
He says many older people cannot find work because they are not strong enough to do day labor, and some resort to begging.
However, the report found, wealthy nations are in general better prepared for aging than poorer ones.
Romance can be tumultuous, and no one knows that better than the Statue of Liberty.
"I don\'t know about you, but I\'m getting a little bit tired of reopening and closing the Statue of Liberty," David Luchsinger, the national monument\'s superintendent, said with a laugh as the sun beat down on Liberty\'s golden torch.
The National Park Service expected to spend about $56 million to fix Liberty Island and adjacent Ellis Island, home to an immigration museum that remains closed.
As they began their climb, dignitaries and special guests gathered behind Lady Liberty for a formal ribbon-cutting ceremony, whose guests mirrored the diverse masses the statue embraces.
The secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, paid tribute to the statue and also to the 19 firefighters killed Sunday in Arizona, breaking down in tears as she called the fallen men "a great reminder of the importance of first-responders" and urged Americans to remember them on Independence Day.
"It\'s not one of the seven or eight wonders of the world," he said, "but it should be."
They included three schoolteachers from Kendallville, Ind., whose elementary school pupils sold lollipops to raise more than $400 to contribute to the statue\'s repair effort; and actor Dominic Chianese, best-known for his role on "The Sopranos" but also an accomplished tenor who sang "God Bless America" to the crowd.

The past dozen years have been especially turbulent for Liberty and for those who yearn to get close to her.
Lady Liberty survived unscathed, but her home was trashed.
The ferry docks were splintered, the electrical and sewage systems were destroyed, and the walkways and railings surrounding her pedestal were a total loss.
"It\'s worth it," said Bev Viger, a visitor from Vancouver, British Columbia, who was visiting with her granddaughter, Makaela.

The picture-perfect beaches and turquoise waters that people expect on their visits to the Caribbean are increasingly being fouled by mats of decaying seaweed that attract biting sand fleas and smell like rotten eggs.
The 2015 seaweed invasion appears to be a bumper crop, with a number of shorelines so severely hit that some tourists have canceled summer trips and lawmakers on Tobago have termed it a "natural disaster."
Like coral reefs, the algae mats are critical habitats and mahi-mahi, tuna, billfish, eels, shrimp, crabs and sea turtles all use the algae to spawn, feed or hide from predators.
In large doses, the algae harms coastal environments, even causing the deaths of endangered sea turtle hatchlings after they wriggle out of the sand where their eggs were buried.
If removal of seaweed involves large machinery, that will also obviously cause impacts to the beaches and the ecosystems there," said Faith Bulger, program officer at the Washington-based Sargasso Sea Commission.
"I just wonder where the seaweed is going to go," the Toronto resident said one recent morning, watching more of the mats drift to shore even after crews had already trucked away big piles to use as mulch and fertilizers.

The mats of drifting sargassum covered with berry-like sacs have become so numerous in the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean they are even drifting as far away as West Africa.
Brownish in color, it is one of a group of simple plants known as algae.
Sargassum generally blooms in the Sargasso Sea, a 2-million-square-mile body of warm water in the North Atlantic that is home to numerous marine species.
The picture-perfect beaches and turquoise waters that people expect on their visits to the Caribbean are increasingly being fouled.
In some cases the sargassum has piled up nearly 10 feet high on beaches.

Kennedy, President Barack Obama laid a wreath at the assassinated president\'s gravesite as a nation remembers that terrible day in Dallas a half-century ago Friday.
The day of tributes began at the White House, where Obama awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 16 living and deceased Americans for their contributions in fields ranging from sports and entertainment to science and public service.
Kennedy established the modern version of the medal but was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, weeks before he was to honor the inaugural group of recipients.
Obama said a few words about each recipient.
The president made a point of highlighting those who had overcome additional obstacles and stigmatization because they are gay, black, female or Asian.
Vice President Joe Biden, another potential candidate, attended only the White House ceremony.
"I\'m grateful, Bill, as well, for the advice and counsel that you\'ve offered me, on and off the golf course," Obama said to chuckles.

The head of the Chicago Police Department has been fired amid widespread criticism over how authorities responded to a white police officer fatally shooting a black teenager last year.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he formally asked Garry McCarthy, the Chicago police superintendent, for his resignation Tuesday morning.
"He has become an issue, rather than dealing with the issue, and a distraction," Emanuel said.
He added that while he is loyal to McCarthy, who he praised for his leadership of the department, the needs of the city are more important.
The mayor said he spoke to McCarthy about "the undeniable fact that the public trust in the leadership of the department has been shaken and eroded."
City leaders and demonstrators had called for Emanuel to remove McCarthy, arguing that new leadership is needed to reassure a troubled public.
Last week, that spokesman said he was relaying information told to him by other people on the scene and said he never spoke with Van Dyke.
McCarthy also defended how the city has responded to the protests that have erupted since the shooting video was released last week, praising "incredible restraint by officers."

In past years, militants routinely attacked health workers carrying out vaccination drives, along with their security teams, killing dozens.
The Khyber Agency tribal area, near Peshawar, the administrative seat of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has emerged as a new trouble spot.
In past years, militants routinely attacked health workers carrying out vaccination drives, along with their security teams, killing dozens.
The tribal belt had more than half of the 307 polio cases Pakistan recorded in 2014.
There, for the first time, health workers could reach families that had been inaccessible.
As a result, 86 percent of the tribal areas are now covered by the vaccine, up from 47 percent, according to health officials.
"There are areas that are still not within reach, where fighting is going on, where we hope to get to sooner or later," Memon said.
In October, a quarter-million children could not be reached by vaccination teams.
Northwest Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan, is a rugged, mountainous area.
Pakistan is one of only three countries, along with Nigeria and Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic or regularly found.
Polio is a viral disease that mostly affects children.
In the early 20th century, polio paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year.
Most of Pakistan is free of the deadly viral disease, but it has been difficult to eradicate in several pockets of the country.
These include the tribal belt, the neighboring province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the seaside metropolis of Karachi.
For years, U.S. officials had urged the Pakistani military to take stronger action against militants based on its soil.
Pakistani army leaders say they have killed hundreds of militants, but the claims have been difficult to verify.
Many took shelter in displacement camps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where they lived temporarily.
Two areas, Bara and Jamrud, remain extremely difficult for health workers to access.
Many militants have moved from the tribal areas to Karachi, the most populous city in Pakistan.
For the past year, the Pakistani army has been waging a campaign against militants in the northern tribal areas of Pakistan.

With President Barack Obama expected to choose the site for his library in less than two months, Chicagoans engaged in a bitter fight over a proposal to place it in a public park.
The dispute placed the university in a controversial light and gave steam to what the University of Chicago considers to be its biggest rival, Columbia University in New York.
Last week, the park board approved the future transfer of 20 acres from whichever park is chosen by the Obamas to the city.

For millions of years the biggest dinosaurs on the planet steered clear of the tropics, and now scientists think they know why.
"It was not a happy place for them to be hanging out," said Nathan Smith, the new curator of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County\'s Dinosaur Institute.
Back in the Triassic, the land mass that is now New Mexico was closer to the equator, he explained.
Despite the uncertain living conditions, the scientists did find evidence of animal life: small-bodied meat-eating dinosaurs and an abundance of reptiles that are relatives of modern-day crocodiles.

Some suggest that climate change and a mass extinction event that wiped out the large-bodied crocodiles may have had something to do with it.
Smith is also in charge of the Dinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles County, California.
The team also determined that the tropical atmosphere contained four to six times as much carbon dioxide as it does today.

An unusual program in Mexico allows painters, sculptors and other artists to donate part of their annual production of artwork to the state instead of paying taxes.
It has also left artists such as Cito content, as they are free from the bother of tax forms and from worry over owing the government large sums of money.
If he or she sells six to eight pieces, two pieces are donated \u2014 and so on, up to a maximum of six pieces donated per year.
"I think it\'s fantastic," said Naomi Siegmann, a sculptor born in New York who\'s lived in Mexico for five decades.
Siegmann said she got a thrill when she saw one of her pieces \u2014 often large objects carved in wood \u2014 gracing a public space.
Siqueiros told the official that an artist friend was facing jail time for not paying taxes.
The program was approved, and since then the federal government has taken in well over 4,000 works of art.
"One supposes that the committee doesn\'t have members with the background or level" to judge what\'s good or bad.
Of course, not every artist who makes a living from selling his or her work is endowed with enormous talent.
"Emerging artists who aren\'t important today might be important tomorrow," he said.
The program, begun in 1957, has helped the government build a huge collection of modern art.
It has also left artists such as Cito content, as they are free from the bother of tax forms and from worry over owing the government large sums of money.
Siegmann said she got a thrill when she saw one of her pieces \u2014 often large objects carved in wood \u2014 gracing a public space.
"They are aware that their pieces may be exhibited not only in Mexico but also abroad," said government official Jose San Cristobal Larrea.
San Cristobal said authorities were careful not to pass judgment on the work collected from artists.
It has also left artists such as Cito content: They are free from the bother of tax forms and the worry of owing large sums of money to the government.
Siegmann said she got a thrill when she saw one of her pieces gracing a public space.
Their goal is to decide whether they fairly represent the body of work of a given artist.
Instead, what the taxman wants is a donation of her artwork.
Cito specializes in colorful oil paintings, as well as chalk drawings on paper.
The program is thought to have arisen from a 1957 meeting between tax official Hugo B. Margain and artist David Alfaro Siqueiros.
The number of artworks artists must give changes from year to year: It depends on how much art they have sold in a year.
No artist, though, is required to give more than six works a year.
It may end up in a government building or a museum, or even be shown in another country.
She had much praise for the Payment in Kind program.
Nearly every artist who takes part in the program agrees.
Since then, it has taken in well over 4,000 works of art.
Lahner said the operation does make the fish look better, but she emphasized, "my main concern is fish health."
At the Seattle Aquarium, a handful of fish have received the implants.
Lahner assisted the Vancouver veterinarians with their one-eyed rockfish last month.
Giving the rockfish a glass eye takes veterinarians about 20 minutes.
Lahner takes two of the flat-backed inserts and glues them together to form a single round eye.
In the past, fish with a missing eye would often be euthanized, or put to sleep, at aquariums, because they were considered ugly, Haulena said.
"It\'s no longer a good idea by any stretch of the imagination to think of animals as disposable, and just go out and get another one," he said.
In the meantime, she will be outfitting several Seattle Aquarium rockfish with prosthetics soon.
Since getting a new eye, the copper rockfish seems to be back to its old self, Lahner said.
A rockfish at the Vancouver Aquarium was having a hard time after veterinarians had to remove one of its eyes.
First, the fish was given anesthesia so it would not feel pain.
For that, she used fishing line and titanium clips.

The major question hovering around the dwarf planet: Was it rich in water, or not?
Astronomers in the 1990s picked up the chemical fingerprint of hydroxyl \u2014 a fragment of the water molecule \u2014 in the light coming from Ceres, but a study in 2011 with more sensitive instruments could not back that claim up.
"One of the most puzzling questions about the origin and evolution of asteroids is why Vesta and Ceres are so different," Humberto Campins and Christine Comfort of the University of Central Florida wrote in a commentary on the Nature paper.
"Now we have really for the first time discovered water in the asteroid belt," said lead author Michael Kuppers, a planetary scientist based in Spain with the European Space Agency.
It could also simply be that exposed ice on the surface in these two areas is sublimating from a solid to a gas when the sun hits it.
Whatever the mechanism, the larger question remains: Why is Ceres so wet?
"I\'m excited to see what Dawn is going to find out," said Kuppers, who works on the space agency\'s comet-hunting Rosetta mission.
However, a study in 2011 with more sensitive instruments could not back that claim up.
It could be that some internal heat is causing the water to rise up and explode into geyser-like blasts of water vapor.
The Herschel Space Telescope remains in space, though it ran out of the coolant needed to keep its instruments working last year.

People who live in the rugged Western states are enduring another summer of scorched-earth devastation.
Colorado saw the most devastating wildfire in its history this year.
And the worst year was 2006, when 9.8 million acres burned.
Western state lawmakers have called on the federal government for more help and criticized its management of public lands.
The U.S. Forest Service labels about 65 million acres of its land at "high or very high risk of wildfires."
Although hot and dry weather is beyond the control of the authorities, states and localities can dictate where and how people live to put them at less risk from the wildfires.
Much of the new population in these states is building houses in zones at serious risk from wildfire.
In the 1990s, some 61 percent of newly built homes in Washington, Oregon and California were considered inside this area.
By 2000, about 42 percent of all homes in those three states were considered to be in the near-wilderness zone.
Researchers at Colorado State University expect that the inhabited fire zones will triple their size in Colorado by 2030 to more than 2.1 million acres.
Rasker is with Headwaters Economics, a nonpartisan think tank in Montana.
State and local leaders play a huge role in fire policy by setting laws on zoning, building construction and property maintenance.
Rasker believes that if that problem got sorted, the other issues would just fall into place.
Other new policies could be introduced to make the inhabitants of the fire zones more responsible for their decisions to move in.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s inspector general wrote that zoning and building regulations may be necessary to "make landowners take the actions necessary to protect their homes and property from wildfire."
Many authorities have enacted strong fire-proofing measures, but many more go without protection or shelve existing plans.
This is also often true in the actual communities at risk from a wildfire.
Some states have taken steps to make these areas safer.
Landowners in Oregon are given fines if they violate these rules.
Two task forces are discussing protection fees, new insurance regulations, building code changes and brush-clearing requirements.

Or the inhabitants of the fire zones could be made more responsible for protecting their property.
But this is useless for stopping fires if other neighbors neglect their lands.
He asked that if people who live in the fire zones "aren\'t going to protect their own lives, why are they expecting others to?"
People have to put special roofs on their buildings.
They also have to clear away dried leaves and other things that would help fuel the flames.

Lee herself is a Monroeville, Alabama, native who lived in New York in the 1950s.
She has rarely spoken to the media since the 1960s, when she told one reporter that she wanted to "to leave some record of small-town, middle-class Southern life."
The new book also will be available in an electronic edition.
Lee has openly stated her preference for paper, but surprised fans last year by agreeing to allow "Mockingbird" to be released as an e-book.
"To Kill a Mockingbird" will not be Harper Lee\'s only published book after all.
After much thought and hesitation, I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication.
Lee herself is a Monroeville, Alabama, native who lived in New York in the 1950s.
According to the publisher, the book will be released as she first wrote it, with no revisions.
Reading in many ways like a sequel to Harper Lee\'s classic novel, it is a compelling and ultimately moving narrative about a father and a daughter\'s relationship, and the life of a small Alabama town living through the racial tensions of the 1950s."
Lee has openly stated her preference for paper, but surprised fans last year by agreeing to allow "Mockingbird" to be released as an e-book.

"In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called \'Go Set a Watchman,\'" Lee, 88, said in a statement released by publisher HarperCollins.
While "To Kill a Mockingbird" is set in the 1930s, "Watchman" is set in the mid-1950s, roughly the same time as when Lee was writing the story.
The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 1953 that segregated schools \u2014 schools separated by race \u2014 were unconstitutional.
Harper Lee herself is from Monroeville, Alabama, but lived in New York in the 1950s.
The book has been occasionally banned over the years because of its language and racial themes.
Still, it has been become standard reading in middle schools and high schools and is common in book clubs.
Lee has openly expressed her preference for paper, but surprised fans last year by agreeing to allow "Mockingbird" to be released as an e-book.
"To Kill a Mockingbird," follows 6-year-old Scout Finch, her brother Jem, and their father Atticus Finch, a local lawyer who defends a black man falsely accused of a serious crime.
The new book revisits the same characters about 20 years later.

In a project that began five years ago, scholars, students and Quinhagak residents are working together to carefully dismantle, document and save relics from a sod house site they call "Nunalleq," or old village.
Had the work not started when it did in 2009, thousands of artifacts at this one site would have washed away.
Village corporation leaders in consultation with elders are partners with the scientists in decision-making: when to dig, how to preserve the site, what to do with the finds.

Until the permafrost began melting and the edge of the tundra eroded into the sea, the old village site, down to wooden cooking spoons, was well-preserved in the hard-frozen earth.
Just in the past five years, 30 feet at the edge of the dig site has been lost.
Had the work not started when it did in 2009, thousands of artifacts at this one site would have washed away.
Of those, as many as 5,000 are special enough to display in a museum, Knecht said.
Fienup-Riordan, the anthropologist, collected impressions and stories from Quinhagak elders about the objects found.
One elder, George Pleasant, was able to identity the source of the stone for an ulu blade by its color.
The artifacts confirm and add detail to the stories of the village, Knecht said.
What the elders say adds layers of explanation.
Quinhagak may just be the start, Knecht said.
Other ancient Alaska village sites along the coast and on rivers are eroding too.
Then the village was attacked and set ablaze around 1640 by a neighboring settlement during the region\'s "Bow and Arrow Wars," he said.
Just in the past five years, 30 feet at the edge of the dig site has been lost.
"I think it\'s the best thing anybody came and helped us do," elder Annie Cleveland said of the dig.

Village leaders work with elders and the scientists in decision-making: when to dig, how to preserve the site, what to do with the finds.
Recently, the archaeologists put some of the most interesting recovered objects on display in the big red community building and invited the whole village to see \u2014 and touch \u2014 them.
It inspired him to recreate some of the more intricate designs.

and its bizarre body parts show it may be the first known semi-aquatic dinosaur.
It had a long thin snout with conical teeth that jutted diagonally from its mouth \u2014 perfect for snapping at fish.
Its nostrils were small and pushed far up on its skull \u2014 ideal for breathing while partly submerged.
The differences from this Spinosaurus and other theropods run from head to toe.
The first Spinosaurus skeleton was discovered in Egypt in 1912 and described by a German scientist, Ernst Freiherr Stromer von Reichenbach, in 1915.
"My jaw dropped," Ibrahim said \u2014 it was a rich collection of leg, foot and rib bones \u2014 and the same strange spines with the red line running through.
Armed with that paltry bit of information, they returned to Erfoud \u2014 a Moroccan oasis town of more than 20,000 people \u2014 and searched for him, with no luck.
On a hunch, Ibrahim decided they needed to find the man with the box.
It now seems, however, that its uniqueness and true appearance may not have been understood.
But in 1944 the bones were destroyed in a bombing raid during World War II.
Aside from the careful drawings Stromer made, and a few photographs, all evidence of the discovery was lost.
Among them Ibrahim noticed a strange blade-shaped fossil with a red line running through it.
Stromer took the skeleton back to Germany.
But in 1944 the bones were destroyed in a bombing raid during World War II.
Inside the box were various ancient bones.
Later, Ibrahim was visiting a museum in Italy when scientists there told him about some strange fossils in the museum basement.
Now, strange dinosaur bones found in Morocco may prove that idea wrong.
New evidence suggests it spent much of its life in water.
Spinosaurus dinosaurs have actually been known about for years.
The spiny sail would have helped it to glide through the water.
Scientists there told him about some strange fossils in the museum basement that had come from Morocco.
Among the bones he saw were several like those he already had: strange blade-shaped fossils with a red line running through.
He was just about to give up and go home when a familiar-looking man walked by.
Ibrahim persuaded the man to take him to the spot where he had found the fossils.

The government has long asked climbers to clear their trash, but there was no mechanism to check what people brought down.
The government did not say what action it would take against climbers who descend without the 8 kilograms of trash.
Hundreds of others have died in the attempt, while many have succeeded only with help from oxygen tanks, equipment porters and Sherpa guides.
Instead, private trekking companies organize logistics and report any problems.
Nepalese \u2014 who consider the mountain they call Sagarmatha to be sacred \u2014 sometimes attribute climbing deaths to bad karma earned through disrespecting the mountain.
The Nepali language name Sagarmatha means "forehead of the sky," while the Tibetan name for Everest is Chomolangma, or "goddess of the snow."
"We are not asking climbers to search and pick up trash left by someone else," said Maddhu Sudan Burlakoti, head of the mountaineering department at the Tourism Ministry.

The Nepali language name Sagarmatha means "forehead of the sky," while the Tibetan name for Everest is Chomolangma, or "goddess of the snow."
Italian climbing legend Reinhold Messner has called for Nepal to close down Everest for a few years for the mountain to rest and recover.
"We are not asking climbers to search and pick up trash left by someone else," said Maddhu Sudan Burlakoti, head of the mountaineering department at the Tourism Ministry.
Starting this spring, Nepali officials at Everest base camp will check that each climber descends the mountain with about 18 pounds of trash.
The government did not say what action it would take against climbers who descend without the 18 pounds of trash.
Last year, a fist fight broke out between three European climbers and several Sherpa guides over safe climbing procedures.
Last month, the government said it would reduce Everest climbing fees to $11,000 a person next year to attract more people.
And the threats were rarely carried out.
More than 4,000 climbers have climbed the 29,035-foot summit since 1953.
Mount Everest, the world\'s highest peak, has earned another nickname: "the world\'s highest garbage dump," because of the tons of trash climbers leave behind.
"We are not asking climbers to search and pick up trash left by someone else," said Maddhu Sudan Burlakoti, head of mountaineering at the Tourism Ministry.
About 230,000 people came to Nepal last year to hike the Himalayas.
About 810 of them attempted to climb Everest.
The air is so thin at the top of the mountain that many climbers need extra oxygen.
They also clean up the trash.
"There is no way to say how much garbage is still left on Everest," said Dawa Steven Sherpa, who leads Eco Everest Expeditions.
Sagarmatha means "forehead of the sky" in Nepali.
Climbers pay Nepal $3.3 million each year to go up the mountain.

He says this will give the mountain a chance to rest and recover.
Pakistani officials kept secret the acquittals of eight men accused of involvement in the October 2012 shooting of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai.
"This is totally beyond comprehension: There are no court case files for the accused and convicted," said Sher Mohammed Khan, a Swat-based lawyer and representative of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.
"Nobody knows who they are, how their trial was conducted, who appeared before the prosecutor, and who represented the accused \u2014 it\'s a classic example of denial of free trial," he said.
Malala first emerged as a celebrity in 2009 after admitting to being "Gul Makai," the author of an Urdu-language diary about life under Taliban occupation in Swat, broadcast by the BBC.
For that, she was targeted for killing by terror chief Mullah Fazlullah, another Swat native.
She was evacuated to Britain for specialist medical care in a United Arab Emirates government aircraft and underwent reconstructive surgeries to restore her eyesight and hearing.

Pakistan freed eight men who were accused in the October 2012 shooting of teenage Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai.
At the time, it had been widely reported that all 10 had been convicted by an anti-terrorist court and sentenced to life imprisonment or 25 years.
Public skepticism about Malala began to lessen only last September, when the military announced it had caught her would-be assassins.

And experts say the practice is growing so rapidly that it will soon become the most common way to steal freight.
News reports from across the country recount just a few of the thefts: 80,000 pounds of walnuts worth $300,000 in California, $200,000 of Muenster cheese in Wisconsin, rib-eye steaks valued at $82,000 in Texas, 25,000 pounds of king crab worth $400,000 in California.

Someone wanting to steal a truckload of copper, for instance, would target shipments coming out of Carrollton, Ga., where a major copper-wire manufacturer is located.
One reason food shipments are popular targets is because they have a lower value than electronics or pharmaceuticals, which are often more heavily protected.
The California Farm Bureau Federation warns about clues that could indicate a suspicious hauler: temporary name placards or identification numbers on the truck, abrupt changes in the time of the pickup and lack of a GPS tracking system on the truck.
And experts say the practice is growing so rapidly that it will soon become the most common way to steal freight.
The most common crime is still the "straight theft" of trailers left unattended in parking lots or at truck stops.
Of the average three to five truckloads stolen each day in the United States, at least one involves what are known in the industry as fraudulent or fictitious pickups.

A disease called "white nose syndrome" has killed a large number of little brown bats in New Jersey.
Back then, their hibernating numbers were about 30,000 in New Jersey.
Federal officials estimate that 7 million bats of various species have died across the country since white nose was first detected in a cave near Albany, New York, in 2006.
The fungus leaves a white powder on their muzzles, ears and wings.
All of the little brown bats would have to live through the winter to start replacing the thousands lost to the disease.
Others are studying a fungus that might be more powerful than the white nose fungus but would not kill any bats.

Only 47,000 gallons a day now flow from the springs, which State Parks shares with the Hearst Ranch, down from a normal of 285,000 gallons a day in a normal year.
That means a trio of reservoirs that typically are filled with 2.75 million gallons of water this time of year are only about a third full, not enough to carry the Castle through the summer.
But most importantly, a Castle staff member suggested using it to meet regulations requiring State Parks to keep 200,000 gallons of water stored on site in case of fire.
Previously, the Castle had allocated reservoir storage to meet that requirement, but has borrowed a pump from the state Office of Emergency Services that can be used to pump Roman Pool water onto any fire.
Hearst Castle visitors will soon find dusty buses, dry fountains and an empty pool, thanks to one of the worst droughts in California history.
On Monday, he estimated the pool was down 5 or 6 feet.
Springs that supply the state historical monument, built by publisher William Randolph Hearst, are running at just one-sixth normal, said Nick Franco, a superintendent with State Parks.
Only 47,000 gallons a day now flow from the springs, down from 285,000 gallons a day normally.
Staff members are figuring out what "can survive with very little water and what won\'t," and are "focusing on the landscape, how we can nurse it along."
Usually this time of year, Franco said, State Parks brings in "thousands of annuals" \u2014 that is, plants whose life cycle lasts only a single growing season, and that are generally replaced annually.

The United States refuses to recognize the zone, but Biden has avoided calling publicly for Beijing to retract it, wary of making demands that China is likely to snub.
Rather, the vice president hoped to persuade China not to enforce the zone or establish similar zones over other disputed territories.
When Biden arrived later at the Great Hall of the People, a ceremonial edifice steps away from Tiananmen Square, any tensions between the United States and China were papered over as Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao welcomed him with an elaborate honor guard.
"To strengthen dialogue and cooperation is the only right choice facing both of our countries."
"Children in America are rewarded \u2014 not punished \u2014 for challenging the status quo," he said.
A one-minute excerpt of his speech posted by the Sina news website included Biden\'s comment about challenging the "status quo," but left out the one about challenging the government.

Meanwhile, the story of exactly how, where, and when dogs evolved remains a mystery.
One possible explanation is that the wolves in that region became cut off from each other.

On the other hand, it could have happened the other way around.
It is possible that some wolves started living with humans before becoming dogs.
There is still much to learn, however.

1st Class Terrence Hoard must reach potential recruits early to set them straight.
They think anybody can enlist.
His office several years back needed to sign up 16 to 20 soldiers per month to meet recruiting targets.
Earlier this month, a dozen fresh recruits and wannabe warriors showed up for push-ups and jumping jacks.
Today, 99 percent of recruits have graduated from high school.
"They call it \'scarring,\' " said economist Sarah Ayres of the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Center for American Progress.
"We\'re turning down twice as many as before," said Hoard, who supervises the Army recruiting station in Grandview.

Oysters started dying by the billions along the Northwest coast in 2005, and have been struggling ever since.
In 2005, when no young oysters survived in Willapa Bay at all, farmers blamed the vagaries of nature.
After two more years with essentially no reproduction, panic set in.
When the tiny bivalves reared there are big enough to produce shells, they are mailed back to Washington and planted in Willapa Bay.

A Washington state oyster family built a 20,000-square-foot shellfish hatchery half an ocean from Seattle.
Scientists cautiously linked the deaths to plummeting ocean pH in 2008 and 2009.
By the early 2000s he was noting a huge change off the West Coast.
The deadly water that surfaces off Washington, California and Oregon is the result of CO2 that entered the sea 20 or 30 years earlier.
Even if fuel burning stops spewing CO2 immediately, West Coast sea chemistry would worsen for almost as long before leveling off.
But the reality is that over the next 10 years the world will have to make significant progress tackling this problem.

Low pH water was natural when it was hundreds of feet below the surface.

The zebras travel between Namibia and Botswana, two countries in a sparsely populated part of southern Africa.
"It goes to show us that nature still has some surprises," said Robin Naidoo, a conservation scientist at the Washington-based World Wildlife Fund.
They start in floodplains near the Namibia-Botswana border at the beginning of the wet season.
The zebras spend about 10 weeks there before heading back.
He says that the migration could be lost if more protective measures are not put in place.
"There are very few places left on our planet where animals and wildlife have the natural ability to roam in the context in which they evolved over thousands of years."
They say their densely populated nation cannot absorb the environmental damage that would result from mining.
It is really ugly that someone is deciding our future without asking our opinion," Pineda said.
Is it really fair, he asked, for a country to have to change its laws to satisfy a foreign company?
It would, he said, encourage "other companies to force other countries to get what they want."
He does not want Australian mining company OceanaGold to dig up the precious metal.
In fact, what happens at the El Dorado gold mine will not be decided in El Salvador at all.
Sometime early in 2015, they will decide if OceanaGold has the right to mine at El Dorado.
They claim the government was ignoring a Salvadoran law from 1999 that permitted mining.
Some people feel such laws are a bad thing.
If OceanaGold wins its case, El Salvador will be in difficult, no-win situation.
It will have two choices: allow OceanaGold to mine or pay the company the $301 million it says it would have earned from the gold.
If that happens, however, the company can make up for it by paying a fine.
If OceanaGold wins, he added, it would set a very bad example.
It would encourage other companies to try to force foreign countries to give them what they want.
"It\'s actually kind of exciting because it\'s water yet again on Mars, but it\'s in a different material than we had recognized," said Caltech geologist John Grotzinger, the mission\'s project scientist.
"So what Curiosity is doing is just demonstrating that water is present in a number of ways.
Another of the studies focused on the rock known as Jake M, named after NASA engineer Jake Matijevic, who died shortly after the rover landed in 2012.
"We see evidence for a more evolved planet," Grotzinger said, "so it looks like it was headed in more of a direction like Earth."
New information suggests that the planet may have small bits of water spread around its surface.
What has scientists excited is that Curiosity has detected traces of water.
The water is chemically bound to the Martian dust that seems to be covering the entire planet.
This told the researchers that it had been created under high pressure \u2014 and perhaps in the presence of water.
recent series of discoveries is making scientists change their ideas about Mars: They now suspect that the Red Planet may be more Earth-like than previously imagined.
It found that there are two major types of Martian soil: One is coarse, and probably came from surrounding rocks.
But it does seem to match the stuff found at places where other rovers have landed.
Curiosity used another of its tools to cook up a tiny sample of soil in a little oven: It turned out that roughly 1.5 to 3 percent was made of water.

Spurning furious Republicans, President Barack Obama unveiled expansive executive actions on immigration Thursday night to spare nearly 5 million people in the U.S. illegally from deportation and refocus enforcement efforts on "felons, not families."
"To those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill," Obama said, flexing his presidential powers just two weeks after his political standing was challenged in the midterm elections.
As Obama spoke from the White House, immigration supporters with American flags draped over their shoulders marched on Pennsylvania Avenue outside carrying signs that read, "Gracias, Presidente Obama."
The address marked the first step in a White House effort to promote the executive actions to the public.
"The president will come to regret the chapter history writes if he does move forward," Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is soon to become the Senate majority leader, said before Obama\'s address.
Obama will expand eligibility to people who arrived in the U.S. as minors before 2010, instead of the current cutoff of 2007, and will lift the requirement that applicants be under 31.
It\'s been worth the pain and sacrifice," said Jesus Zuniga, a 40-year-old who picks tomatoes in California\'s Central Valley and watched the speech at a union gathering in Fresno.
"We have a lot of unemployed Americans right now, and I don\'t understand why unemployed Americans can\'t be hired to do the jobs these illegals are doing," said John Wilson, who works in contract management.

President Barack Obama used executive actions on immigration Thursday night to stop deportations.
Nearly 5 million people in the U.S. illegally will now be able to stay in the U.S.
Executive actions allow Obama to pass rules without Congress.
People who have been in the U.S. for more than 10 years will not be.
Obama insisted that his actions were not an amnesty.
It would also give them some legal rights to stay in the U.S. An amnesty would affect all illegal immigrants.
In all, those changes are expected to affect about 300,000 people.
Immigration-rights supporters gathered around the country to listen to the president.

Now, in an ironic turn of events, Chinese companies are looking to manufacture in the United States, lured by lower costs of energy, cotton and land, and wary of rising labor costs in China.
Keer decided to relocate part of its yarn production line to Lancaster - a $218 million investment.
Feeling the competition intensify, Keer, whose assets exceeded $325 million in 2010, looked toward the Carolinas, after ruling out Vietnam, India and Pakistan as potential destinations.
"The cost difference between the two countries has certainly been narrowed greatly in recent years," said Ling.
Previously, the Department of Commerce worked on just three to five Chinese investment projects every year, but now, there are 20 to 25 Chinese companies visiting South Carolina to evaluate investment opportunities every year, according to Ling.
Keer, a textile company headquartered two hours southwest of Shanghai, China, is building yarn manufacturing lines in Lancaster, bringing more than 500 jobs.
That would be welcomed in Lancaster County, where the pain of lost textile jobs still resonates.
Carolyn Summers worked for Springs Industries in Lancaster for 42 years before being laid off in 2005 when she was 63.
The greater region lost about 26,000 jobs at textile mills in the past 20 years, according to Federal Reserve data.
Since the factories closed, Summers said, "we haven\'t had the luxury of textile here.
SC Ready, a workforce training program in South Carolina, is helping Keer recruit and train local electricians, technicians and fabric sales representatives.
Doug Woodward, economics professor at the University of South Carolina, described the incoming Chinese companies\' investment as "small tiptoes into the U.S. for these big companies."

Said Wang: "Except for human labor, all other production factors are cheaper in the U.S." To be sure, China retains its competitive advantage in many areas of textile manufacturing, including labor-intensive apparel production, which benefits from low labor costs, according to Yingjiao Xu, an associate professor at the College of Textiles at N.C. State University.
U.S. sites have the an upper hand there because of lower-cost energy.

Carolinas textile jobs went to places like China, Brazil and Vietnam.
It will spend about $218 million to do so.
North and South Carolina used to be places where a lot of fabric for clothing was made.
American textile factory jobs went to places like China, Brazil and Vietnam.
Summers remembers leaving the factory "in total shock" the day she heard the news.

It is, for some well-heeled foreign visitors, the ultimate African experience: the thrill of hunting a lion, one of the "Big Five" animals whose habitats are under increasing pressure from human encroachment.
Conservationists say a dead animal was tied to a car to draw the lion out of a national park, and that Palmer first wounded Cecil with a bow before fatally shooting him with a gun after 40 hours of tracking.
Palmer, who said he relied on his professional guides to ensure a legal hunt, has been vilified globally on social media and talk shows and has closed his dental practice for now.
There is also an increasing phenomenon of lion owners charging tourists, many from Europe but also Australia and the United States, to pet and cuddle cubs earmarked for trophy kills when they get older, he said.
Hunting "is a source of much needed foreign exchange, job creation, community development and social upliftment," Environment Minister Edna Molewa said in a July 23 statement.
"Our goal is to understand the threats that lions face, and to use cutting-edge science to develop solutions to those threats," director David Macdonald said on the unit\'s website.
"Short of going on a culling exercise where you are just shooting animals willy-nilly in order to reduce numbers, there is need to have a scientific way of doing it, which also brings resources for purposes of conservation," he said.

He said nearly 1,000 lions that are bred in captivity in South Africa are fatally shot every year by trophy seekers for an average of about $20,000, and sometimes up to $50,000.
Some conservationists, however, believe the figure is inflated to support the argument that hunting is an economic boon.
Another estimate puts the number closer to 30,000.

It said the bombings were to punish Uganda for taking part in the African Union mission.
Kenyatta said in his television address that the military and police operation at the mall was "delicate" because the main priority was to save the lives of hostages.
Umar Ahmed, an 18-year-old who was injured by a grenade, told Kenyan television he was in the rooftop parking area when he heard shooting and screams.

"I let them know I am a pastor and I am going to pray," Nathaniel said.
When Nathaniel continued to lead prayers on his new routes, Durham sent him a separation letter dated Oct. 30, saying: "There have been more complaints of religious material on the bus as well as other complaints regarding performance.
Durham spokeswoman Molly Hart said "the company does not have a specific policy on the subject of prayer."
Then each person will pray if they want to pray.
Burnsville-Eagan-Savage School District communications director Ruth Dunn declined to comment on the prayers but said, "We do consider the school bus to be an extension of the school day when it pertains to student behavior and support."
Teresa Nelson, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, said "the school bus driver has the right to pray on his own time, but when he has a captive audience of kids on a school bus, that would violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment."

The report was released right before The World Economic Forum, which opens on Wednesday in Switzerland.
It is a gathering spot for international leaders in politics, education and business.
The past 25 years have seen more and more money go to fewer and fewer people, the website said.
The very richest people on Earth collected almost all of the wealth that was created after the crisis, the report said.
When there is growth and less inequality, the report said, the rules of business work to help the middle classes and the poorest sections of society.
But, the report continued, when only the rich are making money, the rules start bending to help only the rich.
Now the city is ready to take an active role in the next environmental push \u2014 using roofs to grow food.
He believes there are at least 13 rooftop farms in Chicago, although he said there could be more.
He believes city-based agriculture can help us to improve how we grow and distribute food.
Former mayor of Chicago, Richard M. Daley, got the idea after seeing rooftop gardens during a trip to Germany.
In the years since, green roofs have garnered a lot of attention.
Washington officials said the city has 2.3 million square feet of green roofs, while Philadelphia reported more than 1 million square feet.
To better promote city farming, Chicago in 2011 passed a zoning law specifically allowing rooftop farms to be built in the city.
It began a partnership with Gotham Greens last spring.
Gotham Greens was looking for a place in Chicago to expand its brand and Method reached out and suggested a partnership.
They do not store as well as other vegetables that have to be shipped long distances either.
The greens will be sold to local retailers, food distributors, restaurants and farmers markets.
For more than a decade, Chicago has been at the forefront of the green-roof movement, with its hundreds of rooftop gardens.
For more than 10 years, Chicago has been a leader in the green-roof movement to add gardens to the roofs of buildings.
Rooftop farms are sprouting all around the city.
Years later, Borders still is collecting bones and curiosities, only now they are his canvas for intricate designs and hang in galleries where they sell for hundreds and thousands of dollars each.
The pieces consist of animal bones, mostly skulls, into which Borders has engraved and inked complex designs of lines and dots that resemble traditional mehndi tattoos.
Borders says he remembers always making things with his hands and taking classes presented by the Lexington Art League at the Loudoun House.
"The garage was right underneath my house, and I ended up filling the house with bone dust, and made myself really sick and made my wife really angry.
But the bone pieces have become a signature, he says, drawing a wide range of reactions from "little old housewives who think they\'re really disturbing" to "people closer to my age who are like, \'Oh, that is so hard-core, bro.\'
"I will often go trade with local farmers, like do a couple hours work or trade them a small piece of art for a bunch of bones.
Before he even started school, Jason Borders tended to collect objects such as animal bones that he found while exploring his neighborhood near Ashland, the Henry Clay Estate in Lexington, Ky. "I always had a little cabinet of curiosities in my room, and in the garage," Borders recalls.
Before he even started school, Jason Borders tended to collect objects such as animal bones that he found while exploring his neighborhood near Ashland, the Henry Clay Estate in Lexington, Ky. "I always had a little cabinet of curiosities in my room, and in the garage," Borders recalls.
Eventually, he began working with Lexington artist and gallery owner Gayle Cerlan.
At home, after cleaning the bones, he noticed his grinding tool.
Someone gave it to him for Christmas.
At first, Borders says, the bones were just something he experimented with.
It annoys him "when people just see them as carved bones and aren\'t actually paying attention to the art."
A question he frequently gets is, How does he get the bones?
Before long, it may well be genetically modified salmon, the first such altered animal cleared for human consumption in the United States.
Ron Stotish, the company\'s CEO, said in a statement that the fish is a "game changer that brings healthy and nutritious food to consumers in an environmentally responsible manner without damaging the ocean and other marine habitats."
The FDA released separate wording that would set guidelines for retailers who do want to label the fish, along with additional guidance for voluntary labeling of genetically modified plant foods.
They worry it could cause human allergies and the eventual decimation of the natural salmon population if it escapes into the wild.
"There\'s no place on our dinner plates for genetically engineered fish," said Lisa Archer of the environmental advocacy group Friends of the Earth.
She and other Alaska and Pacific Northwest lawmakers said they will swiftly push legislation to mandate labeling of the modified fish.
The agency said that there are "multiple and redundant levels of physical barriers" in the facilities to prevent the escape of fish.
The salmon has an added growth hormone from the Pacific Chinook salmon that allows that fish to produce growth hormone all year long.
Engineers have been able to keep the hormone active by using another gene from an eel-like fish called an ocean pout that acts like an "on" switch.
She took to the Senate floor to criticize the FDA shortly after the announcement, saying she was "spitting mad."
She and other Alaska and Pacific Northwest lawmakers said they will swiftly push legislation to mandate labeling of the modified fish.
Typical Atlantic salmon produce the growth hormone for only part of the year.
The fish grows twice as fast as regular salmon, reaching the size it needs to be when sold more quickly than regular salmon.\xa0 AquaBounty, a\xa0company in Massachusetts, designed the new salmon.
It takes the salmon about two years to grow, so the product should be available in grocery stores in that time, AquaBounty said.
She and other Alaska and Pacific Northwest lawmakers said they will swiftly push for legislation to mandate labeling of the modified fish.

SHINGTON \u2013Spring is off to a soggy and sometimes deadly start in the Midwest, where floodwaters have driven thousands of people from their homes and killed at least four.
Many of those are concentrated in the Northeast.
Attorney Lisa Blatt, representing Oklahoma, said the lack of stream-flow gauges in the basin makes it nearly impossible to tell how much water each state is drawing, and whether they are sticking to a four-state agreement.
It was that type of flood that killed at least 26 people in May 2010 in Tennessee and Kentucky.
Warnings can help save lives and money, studies by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Service (NOAA) have found.
But the USGS was able to scrape together enough local support to keep them running -- for now, at least.
New York recently faced the threat of dozens of shutdowns, including many gauges in the Susquehanna River Basin, one area in the country most vulnerable to floods.
Susan Obleski, of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, said she was glad the funding came through, but it will only last four months.
Though the proposed budget has a slim -- if any -- chance to wriggle through Congress, Norris takes it as a sign that politicians, even those trying to pinch pennies, see the value of the gauges.

SHINGTON \u2013 At least four people have been killed in Midwest floods caused by record rains this spring.
Forecasters said that even more people could have died if it were not for river gauges.
The United States has a whole system of gauges to quickly track the rise of rivers.
So experts say shutting the stations could have really bad results.
The government says 145 stations have recently been shut.
The cutbacks threaten to delay flood warnings.
Just a one-hour warning can reduce damage by 10 percent.
"Data was absolutely critical," earlier this month, said Mark Walton, manager of the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Grand Rapids.
Without the data, "we would have basically been flying blind," he said.
He said money is needed to keep the network of gauges running everywhere.
President Barack Obama on Monday launched a private-sector program to promote opportunities for men and boys of color, decrying the "sense of unfairness and of powerlessness" that fuels such violent eruptions as the Baltimore riots and pledging to make equality a cause of his lifetime.
"These are big problems in America, and he is in a special position to get people talking about them.
"He\'s likely to be more effective in that way than by trying to pass legislation in trying to deal with them," he said.
"There\'s a through-line of concern for men and boys of color that started long before he was in the White House and will last long after he\'s closed the doors to that building for the last time," DuBois said.
In conversations with staffers, Obama has repeatedly returned to the idea that the real problems require a concerted, lasting effort, DuBois said.
The new organization aims to build "a national ecosystem" to help boys and young men of color, primarily through educational initiatives and intervention programs designed to close what Obama called the "opportunity gap," boosting education and employment rates that lag behind those of their peers.

The president of the University of Missouri system resigned Monday with the football team and others on campus in open revolt over his handling of racial tensions at the school.
One student began a hunger strike a week ago.
"This is not the way change comes about," he said, alluding to recent protests, in a halting statement that was simultaneously apologetic, clumsy and defiant.
Head football coach Gary Pinkel expressed solidarity on Twitter, posting a picture of the team and coaches locking arms.
A statement issued by Pinkel and Missouri Athletic Director Mack Rhoades linked the return of the protesting football players to the end of a hunger strike by a black graduate student who began the effort Nov. 2 and had vowed to not eat until Wolfe was gone.
Also, a swastika drawn in feces was found recently in a dormitory bathroom.
The association said in a letter Sunday to the system\'s governing body that there had been "an increase in tension and inequality with no systemic support" since last year\'s fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, which is about 120 miles east of Columbia.
Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was shot and killed by a white police officer during a struggle, and his death helped spawn the "Black Lives Matter" movement criticizing police treatment of minorities.
The president of the University of Missouri system resigned Monday with the football team and others on campus in open revolt over his handling of racial tensions at the school.
He urged students, faculty and staff to use the resignation "to heal and start talking again to make the changes necessary."
The protests began after the student government president, who is black, said in September that people in a passing pickup truck shouted racial slurs at him.
At least 150 students gathered at the plaza Sunday night to pray, sing and read Bible verses, a larger crowd than on previous days.
One of the sit-in participants, Abigail Hollis, a black undergraduate, said the campus is "unhealthy and unsafe for us."

Students at the school had been very angry at President Tim Wolfe.
They said he did not do enough after black students were called racist names and felt unsafe.
The recent trouble began in September after the student government president said that people in a passing pickup truck shouted racist names at him.
In early October, several other black students said they also were called racist names.
They called on school leaders to do something to make black students feel safer.
He declared he would not eat until Wolfe stepped down.
On Monday, at least 30 black football players joined the protests.
They announced they would stop playing football until the president was gone.
If the game is not played, the school will have to pay out more than a million dollars.
One of the most famous portraits of George Washington will soon get a high-tech examination and face-lift of sorts with its first major conservation treatment in decades.
The Lansdowne portrait has been a centerpiece at the Smithsonian since 1968, and about 1 million visitors see it each year.
In 2001, film X-rays of the painting revealed some changes Stuart made in the picture.
The premiere portraitist of his day, Stuart packed symbols of American history into his depiction of Washington.
"The storm clouds had to do with the passing of the American Revolution," Fortune said, "and the rainbow signified a new beginning for the new republic."

One of the most famous paintings of George Washington is getting sent to the cleaners.
Because it is so old, layers of dirt have built up on its surface over the years.
Now, experts are planning on using high-tech tools to carefully clean the picture.
Experts will delicately try to remove this layer without damaging the painting underneath.
This event helped make the painting well-known.
In 2016, it will have to come down off display and will be sent to the laboratory.

Short story master Alice Munro, who captures the everyday lives and epiphanies of men and women in rural Canada with elegant and precise prose, won the Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday.
Munro is the first Canadian writer to receive the prestigious $1.2 million award from the Swedish Academy since Saul Bellow, who left for the U.S. as a boy and won in 1976.
Munro told Canadian broadcaster CBC she was "surprised and delighted" at the news, which she heard in a pre-dawn phone call from her daughter.
She won a National Book Critics Circle prize for "Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage," and is a three-time winner of the Governor General\'s prize, Canada\'s highest literary honor.
Munro is the 13th female literature laureate in the 112-year history of the Nobel Prizes.
Short story master Alice Munro, who captures the everyday lives and epiphanies of men and women in rural Canada with elegant and precise prose, won the Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday.
"She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to come a little bit in the shadow behind the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection," Englund told The Associated Press.
In a 1994 interview published in the Paris Review, she said she made a mistake in trying to write "Lives of Girls and Women" as a regular novel.
Her narrative talents resurfaced but her marriage collapsed.
Among her best known is "The Bear Came Over the Mountain," the story of a woman who begins losing her memory and agrees with her husband that she should be placed in a nursing home.
"I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win," the 82-year-old said by telephone when contacted by The Canadian Press in Victoria, British Columbia.
In a 1994 interview published in the Paris Review, she said she made a mistake in trying to write "Lives of Girls and Women" as a regular novel.
Some have called her "the greatest author in North America and, yes, I tend to agree with that," said the academy\'s Englund.

"I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win," the 82-year-old writer said by telephone when contacted by The Canadian Press in Victoria, British Columbia.
The award is likely to be the capstone to Munro\'s career, as she told Canada\'s National Post in June that she was "probably not going to write anymore."

Canadian short story writer Alice Munro won the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday.
In a 1994 interview, she said she made a mistake in trying to write "Lives of Girls and Women" as a regular novel.
Her stories tend to revolve around her experience there and her life after the social revolution of the 1960s.
She received a scholarship to study at the University of Western Ontario, majoring in journalism.
Munro was still an undergraduate when she sold a story to CBC radio in Canada.

In a 1994 interview, she said she made a mistake in trying to write "Lives of Girls and Women" as a regular book, or novel.
She dropped out of college to marry a fellow student, James Munro.
But Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said last month: "I think the Long-Range Strike Bomber is absolutely essential to keep our deterrent edge."
There are few places the lure of a new bomber can be felt more profoundly than Palmdale, California.
According to Ledford, Northrop executives have said they would build substantial parts of the bomber in Palmdale, creating about 1,500 jobs.
They also want it to one day be capable of being flown remotely as a drone.
The Air Force plans to award the contract for as many as 100 of the new planes as soon as late spring.
He estimated in September that the stealth bomber program would ultimately cost $90 billion \u2014 or about $900 million for each plane.
The Air Force is already spending billions of dollars to modernize its current fleet of 150 bombers.
The Congressional Budget Office has repeatedly pointed to the new bomber as a program that could be cut.
In fact, for years, defense officials may have been secretly paying for its development, analysts say.
Last year, congressional analyst Jeremiah Gertler said that based on budget figures, it appeared that models had already been built and were being tested.
Lancaster Mayor Parris said the bomber could end up creating jobs throughout the area, including at restaurants, stores and manufacturing suppliers.
For elected officials across the country, however, the bomber contract means one thing: jobs.

IJING - China abandoned its "one-child policy" Thursday and announced it would allow all couples to have two children, the state news agency Xinhua reported, in a sign of economic pressures from an aging population.
Wang called it "great news" even if the effects of the change will take a generation or more to possibly reverse demographic trends.
But that policy shift did not appear to lead to a big pickup in birth rates, with economic pressures and the cultural norms around having one child meaning many families decided to stay as they were.

On any given day in the Pakistani capital, a group of young people can be seen gathered outdoors in an open field, books open and looking at makeshift blackboards attached to metal pipes in an open-air school.
For three decades, children who might otherwise have received no education sat through his classes.
Ayub, a 57-year-old government worker, came to Islamabad in 1976 from his hometown of Mandi Bahauddin, about 170 kilometers (105 miles) from the capital to find a job so he could take care of his seven siblings after his father died.
Back home, he had struggled through a number of menial jobs.
Ayub convinced other boys working in shops and food outlets in the neighborhood to study with him in the middle of the market for an hour or two.
Over the years, Ayub has been joined by a small army of volunteers, including a retired school principal, a doctor, a fireman and several older students who teach the younger ones.
Ayub is gradually becoming a legend among his students, part of the dedication that led Irfan Siddiqi, a senior adviser to the prime minister, to nominate him for the "Pride of Performance" award, which is given to Pakistanis for contributions in various fields.
Students love him so much that they have marked out a corner of the land where they plan to bury him when he dies so they will continue to feel his influence even after he is gone.
Farhat Abbas, a former student who has come back to tutor others, still remembers when Ayub found him cutting down wood in a neighborhood forest to make money for his family and persuaded him to come and study.

Now, however, she and other students like her are receiving more attention under a new state law and initiatives by Los Angeles Unified and other school districts.
The law requires the state to define and identify a "long-term English learner," the first effort in the nation to do so.
In its inaugural data released this week, the state has identified nearly 350,000 students in grades six through 12 who have attended California schools for seven years or more and are still not fluent in English.
In addition, Fairfax High Principal Carmina Nacorda said, more than 70 percent of her 125 long-term English learners have educational disabilities.
In Los Angeles Unified, about a third of the 600,000 students are learning English and more than 35,000 of them are still not at grade level after five years.
What helped him succeed?
"I should be more confident in English because I was born here, but I\'m embarrassed that I haven\'t improved myself," said Dasha, a junior at Fairfax High.
A 2010 study by the nonprofit found that many students languished because schools failed to monitor their progress, provide appropriate curriculum or train teachers.

For many years, fishermen in the Solomon Islands have been using a form of fishing called drive hunting.
The study looked at one village where drive hunting is popular.
But the deal broke down in 2013 and hunting began again.
What they found was troubling: during just the first three months of 2013, the Fanalei villagers killed at least 1,674 dolphins.
The International Whaling Commission protects large whales, but not small marine mammals such as dolphins.
Baker said dolphin hunting around the world is increasing.
When Curtis Morrison moved to Seattle from the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana, he found himself homeless, facing legal problems and in need of medicine to treat his depression.
The idea for the Urban Indian Legal Clinic began at the end of 2006, according to Lael Echo-Hawk, a Pawnee, who was president of the Northwest Indian Bar Association at the time.
An urban area also lacks the support base common on a reservation.
Growing up on the Fond du Lac Reservation of Northern Minnesota, Dunlap said, he never knew his family was impoverished.
The clinic is self-sustaining and has been able to continue without as much involvement from other organizations.
Dunlap said the Chief Seattle Club and the clinic are an example for the rest of Indian Country to follow.

They hope the listing will provide a stronger legal case to release Lolita than did a previous lawsuit that centered on alleged violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act.
"Lolita has been part of the Miami Seaquarium family for 44 years," Andrew Hertz, Seaquarium general manager, said in a statement.
She would be accompanied by familiar trainers who could "trust and reassure her every bit of the way," he said.
The controversy over releasing captive whales has been heightened by the experience of Keiko, a captive orca that starred in the 1993 movie "Free Willy," about a boy who pushed for the release of a whale.
He says Keiko never was able to forage for fish on his own, and that he continued to seek out human contact at every opportunity.
Simmons wrote a book called "Killing Keiko," that accuses the release effort of leading to a long slow death for the orca, which he says lacked food and then succumbed to an infection.
"It\'s not really the fact that Keiko died, but how he died," Garrett said Wednesday.
Possible causes for the decline are reduced prey, pollutants that could cause reproductive problems and oil spills, according to NOAA Fisheries.
She would be accompanied by familiar trainers who could "trust and reassure her every bit of the way," he said.

He loved it."
"It\'s not really the fact that Keiko died, but how he died," Garrett said Wednesday.
The group hopes a San Juan Island cove off Washington state will one day serve as the site for Lolita to re-enter the wild.
Under the Endangered Species Act, it is illegal to harm or mistreat a protected orca.
Garrett said the plan for Lolita calls for her to be taken to a netted area of the cove, which could be enlarged later if she seemed to be doing well.
She would be accompanied by familiar trainers who would "reassure her every bit of the way," he said.
In 1998, Keiko was brought back to his native waters off Iceland to begin training for an attempt to reintroduce him to life in the ocean.
He was released into Icelandic waters with other wild whales in 2002 and died in a Norwegian fjord in 2003.

They also believe it is inhumane to force her to perform in shows.
On Wednesday, the government declared that Lolita is still a Puget Sound orca.
They are part of the dolphin family and are very large.
Males can grow as much as 30 feet long, and females as long as 26 feet.
There are now fewer than 80 wild orcas left in the Puget Sound near Washington state.
Howard Garrett belongs to a group called the Orca Network.
There she could be prepared to re-enter the wild, he said.
"Lolita has been part of the Miami Seaquarium family for 44 years," said Andrew Hertz, who runs Seaquarium.
Between 1965 and 1975, many Puget Sound orcas were captured by aquariums.
They also believe it is wrong to force her to perform in shows.
Garrett said if Lolita is freed, she would first be taken to a netted-off area of the bay.
People who replace even half an hour of sedentary time with 30 minutes of light activity can improve their health, researchers said.
"It\'s so insidious in our culture."
On Wednesday, Shaun White, the most famous snowboarder in the world, abruptly withdrew from slopestyle.
This is another troubling development for a Winter Games that cost roughly $51 billion to stage, but has been beset by concerns over safety, cost overruns, human rights and construction woes.
Much is at stake for Russia, which is hosting the Olympics for the first time since the Soviet Union broke up.
Earlier this week, a favorite in the slopestyle competition, Torstein Horgmo of Norway, fell on a jump during a practice run and broke his collarbone, ending his Olympics.
They met with athletes and tweaked the 2,083-foot-long course in an effort to moderate it.
Athletes also reported that rails \u2014 terrain features used to stage tricks and stunts \u2014 were too sticky and needed to be waxed.
"Shaun is the consummate professional and has made a sound athletic decision," said Jeremy Forster, the USSA\'s snowboarding and free-skiing director.
Slopestyle was fast-tracked into the Olympics only three years ago, an unusual departure for the conservative International Olympic Committee.
One of its most prominent competitors, Canadian freestyle skier Sarah Burke, died in a training accident two years ago.
Slopestyle, the newest Olympic event, was always going to be a flashy addition to the Games.
Athletes also reported that rails \u2014 terrain features used to stage tricks and stunts \u2014 were too sticky and needed to be waxed.

Retail fashion giant Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has agreed to change controversial employee dress rules after being sued by two San Francisco Bay Area women who wanted to wear a Muslim headscarf.
The popular retailer agreed to change its "look policy" to provide better protections for women wearing the hijab, said lawyers for Hani Khan.
Khan, 23, was fired from a part-time job in 2010 at a store owned by Abercrombie in San Mateo because she refused to remove her hijab.
"If it could happen to me in the Bay Area, it could happen to anyone," said Khan, a recent graduate of the University of California, Davis.
Khan said the last 3 1/2 years have been a "roller coaster" but that the fight was worthwhile.
Khan was initially hired in 2009 at Hollister in Hillsdale Shopping Center.
Abercrombie did not admit violating the law.
Abercrombie said in a statement Monday that it was glad to put these "very old matters" behind it.
She is an attorney who represented Khan for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
But attorneys will watch the company closely to ensure it follows the law, she said.

Disadvantaged teens may get more than an academic boost by attending top-notch high schools \u2014 their health may also benefit, a study suggests.

His escape from the Nazis was more like "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" than "The Sound of Music," Leon Prochnik admits.
As they were smuggled out of the country, they left behind a luxurious life made possible by their Krakow chocolate-making business.
His life was once as sweet as the chocolate the family produced, Prochnik tells his young audiences.
Getting used to that was very hard," he explains.
He first talked about his childhood experience with the Holocaust when his wife, Mia, invited him to speak to a class she was teaching at a Los Angeles elementary school.
So far, about 1,000 children have heard about his escape from the Nazis.
Ninth-grader Aiyanna Pillado, 13, concurred.
His family was never able to return to their Krakow home or to the chocolate factory.

"Head lice just gets everyone over-excited."
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 6 million to 12 million U.S. children between the ages of 3 and 11 are infested each year by lice, which do not carry disease.
She does not send a general notification letter to other parents for fear of hysteria.
She believes the bugs move among hats and coats on racks or among students working in close quarters.
To find out, Pontius consulted some experts.
She contacted the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC), a government agency that works to stop outbreaks of major illnesses.
She also got in touch with the American Academy of Pediatrics, a group representing doctors who treat children.
So it seemed reasonable that students being treated for lice could remain in class without risk to others.

"He can do anything," said Terry Duty, Tahoma High\'s principal, who has worked with Bergum for nearly two decades.
The mop corralled an empty fruit cup, broken potato chips, a straw wrapper and crushed popcorn into a pile near a trash can \u2014 a relatively small load, he said, not like the mounds of trash left on floors after testing or the day before a break from school, when the students are wound up.

Questlove, drummer for the hip-hop band the Roots, urged fellow musicians via Instagram and Twitter last week "to be a voice of the times that we live in," noting that "protest songs don\'t have to be boring or non-danceable."
Several professionals have already released home-produced tribute songs to Brown and Garner, including Alicia Keys, Long Beach rapper Crooked I, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morelo and hip-hop producer J. Cole.
"It often takes time for ideas to percolate through and for people to step back and take a breath and write meaningful tunes," said Ian Peddie, an English professor at Georgia Gwinnett College who studies the intersection of popular music and human rights.

The top 10 candidates, ranked based on national polls, took the prime-time stage \u2014 with Trump at the center \u2014 before a crowd of 5,000.
Trump had tamped down expectations before his debut, saying he did not have as much experience debating as others.

State workers performed a California winter ritual last week, poking hollow aluminum tubes into Sierra Nevada meadows to measure the snowpack.
"We will conceivably see more years like this in the future," said geologist Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.
On Thursday, the snowpack was a paltry 25 percent of average for this time of year.
A parched January is partly to blame.
But the snowpack is also skimpy because warm storms that hit the state in December dumped copious amounts of rain, not snow.
Dealing with the rain was not a problem in December, when storms powered by giant ribbons of water vapor called atmospheric rivers drenched California with 180 percent of average precipitation for the month.
Three years of severe drought meant that big reservoirs had plenty of room to swallow the surge of runoff.
Dams are operated according to a fairly rigid set of rules developed for each reservoir by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and written into federal law.
Called rule curves, the operating manuals consist of pen-and-ink drawings that show the specific reservoir level that managers are supposed to maintain on a given date.
"The trick is, they\'ve all been custom-done based on historical hydrology," state climatologist Mike Anderson said.
asked Iris Stewart-Frey, a Santa Clara University associate professor of environmental studies who has studied shifts in the timing of snowmelt.

State workers performed a California winter ritual last week, poking hollow aluminum tubes into Sierra Nevada meadows to measure the snowpack.
On Thursday, California workers poked hollow aluminum tubes into meadows of the Sierra Nevada mountain range to measure the snowpack.
The snow melts gradually over several months, trickling down mountainsides into rivers and swelling reservoirs in the spring and early summer.
The reservoirs fill just when demand for irrigation for farmland and drinking water goes up.
Dams are operated according to a set of rules developed for each reservoir by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and written into federal law.
They are in the early stages of studying whether rules should be changed because of the warming climate.

They were replaced by Republicans who opposed the new restrictions.
The laws limit gun magazines to 15 rounds and require universal background checks, to be paid for by the gun purchaser, among other restrictions.
The party has a much larger majority in the state House, enough to thwart any legislative effort to overturn the gun laws.
A group of sheriffs has also filed a lawsuit to overturn the legislation.
Colorado Senate President John Morse and state Senator Angela Giron were vital figures in turning the strict gun legislation into law.
Morse and Giron helped pass sweeping gun control measures last winter after several mass shootings in 2012.
Colorado was also the scene of the Columbine High School massacre in April 1999.
Grass-roots activists launched the recall effort even before the new law was actually signed.
What began as a local effort, however, quickly gained national attention.
Advocates on both sides of the gun control debate hoped to either frighten or strengthen lawmakers nationwide who might be considering similar laws.
Both sides poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into their efforts and campaigned fiercely in the days leading up to the vote.
The same newspaper said in August that Bloomberg had donated $350,000 in support of the senators.
With the replacement of Morse and Giron by Republicans, the Democratic hold on the Colorado state Senate has shrunk to just one seat.
Giron, a freshman lawmaker on the other hand, would have faced re-election in 2014.
"If it cost me my political career, that\'s a small price to pay," Morse said.
The former senator said that she had no regrets about voting for the stricter gun laws.
They also require background checks on every gun owner.
On the other side, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg supported Morse and Giron.
This turned the contest into an intense debate in Colorado and across the United States.
The laws were written after several mass shootings in 2012.
Morse said he would continue to fight for control of guns.
He believes that the laws he made make Colorado safer.
Some believe there should be more rules about who owns guns.
The NRA believes that there should be no more laws on guns.
The people who do not believe in gun control are hoping to organize another vote in 2014.
Giron had hoped to win re-election next year.
Trouble was, she was not doing much of anything with her baby.
The difference between the two zoos is that the Lowry Zoo has a chimp mom who has already raised two adopted chimp babies.
He also said that Carole was chosen as a chimp who would make a good mom.
However, Keeva is still one lucky chimpanzee.
If this had happened in the wild, she almost certainly would have died.
While Keeva was in Baltimore, her handlers took every step possible not only to keep her healthy and comfortable, but to make her think she was being raised by one of her fellow chimps.
They held her all the time, wore fur vests, groomed her and made chimp noises to her.
She may have been too young to realize it, but the 17-day-old chimp was getting the royal treatment.
The pilot flew his own plane from Florida to Baltimore so Keeva could be transported safely and comfortably to her new home.
Mother and adoptive daughter seem to get along, and the other chimps have been keeping an eye on things, clearly curious about this youngster.
Hickman Mills school nutritionist Leah Schmidt has always loved solving that puzzle of serving up healthy meals that nose-wrinkling children actually will eat.
"It used to be fun playing with things, letting kids pick things," Schmidt said of menu planning.
As things are, schools already have responded to weekly limits on calories, sodium and fat while meeting rising expectations on nutrients, grains and meats \u2014 all variable according to the ages of students, including limits within limits.
But the puzzle may soon become too hard, Schmidt fears.
Since the new standards were first implemented in 2012, the number of children participating in [lunch and breakfast programs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch) has fallen by 1.2 million, from 31 million to less than 30 million.

School nutritionist Leah Schmidt has always loved solving one particular puzzle: How do you serve up healthy meals that picky children will actually eat?
Schools already are feeling some strain.
"You have to mess with it," she said, meaning that nutritionists have to come up with new recipes.

In the summer of 1914, with the war in Europe just two weeks old, Henry James knew that something had been lost forever.
"You and I, the ornaments of our generation, should have been spared this wreck of our belief that through the long years we had seen civilization grow and the worst become impossible.
It seems to me to undo everything, everything that was ours, in the most horrible retroactive way."
Prolonged conflicts destroy the worlds they were born in, and few did so as thoroughly and as terribly as World War I, which began 100 years ago this month.
"If you look at the 19th century, you have this whole notion of progress through technology \u2014 the notion of science, the increasing organization of society," says Jan Schall, an art historian and curator of modern and contemporary art at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri.
The war overran and destroyed the dream.

In 1917, commercial artist James Montgomery Flagg was asked by the U.S. government to create a poster that would encourage young people to join the military.
He added a simple caption: "I Want YOU For U.S. Army," shortened in popular memory to "UNCLE SAM WANTS YOU."

Fogle is accused by Russia of spying for the CIA under the guise that he was a low-level U.S. diplomat in Moscow.
The State Department remained tight-lipped and tried to downplay the incident.
"I doubt he had this kit on him," he said. "
It was planted on him for political theater."
But Peter Earnest, a former 36-year CIA veteran, said it was possible a CIA agent would use a compass and wigs during an undercover operation.
The Russians might have been motivated to publicly embarrass a CIA agent after the Russians in 2010 had the long-term cover blown for its ring of 10 spies in the United States.
"Those were his goals in life," Ben Flicker, one of those roommates who is now an attorney in Denver, recalled Wednesday.
"He had this sense of service, of duty.

Flashback to a 1940s jazz club.
"These are the successful cultural rebels of American culture," said Joel Dinerstein, a professor and jazz scholar at Tulane University who co-curated the show and teaches a college course on the history of being cool.
No presidents past or present fit the criteria for defining cool, though curators considered Obama, Clinton, Reagan and Kennedy.
To be included, a person had to have an original artistic vision with a signature style, represent cultural rebellion or transgression, have instant visual recognition, and have a recognized and lasting cultural legacy.
The most difficult section to curate was the legacy of cool from the 1980s onward, Goodyear said.
To be included, a person had to have an original artistic vision with a signature style, represent cultural rebellion or transgression, have instant visual recognition, and have a recognized and lasting cultural legacy.
It was so difficult to choose just 100 people, the exhibit also includes an alternate list of 100 names at the end who the curators argued about the longest.

Using PCR, a special enzyme is added and the DNA is heated up to 94 degrees Celsius (202 degrees Fahrenheit).
"You could run this and they can say, \'Yep, you have a bacterial infection, here\'s the antibiotic,\' or \'it\'s a virus, go home and rest.\'
The amplification now takes only three minutes but other preparations make the whole process longer.
In that technique, cold water is passed over a porous copper platform holding the microscopic samples, rapidly dropping the temperature to 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit).
Dr. John Leamon, head of biological research and development at CyVek, an American biotech company focused on health care, said rapid PCR could be a valuable tool in other areas where time plays a key factor.
Lab spokesman Steve Wampler said two unnamed companies have already expressed interest in licensing the technology, adding that a consumer version of the device would take at least five to seven years to bring to market.
It takes about three minutes to run the 30 cycles needed to amplify the DNA to a size where it can be identified.
The platform is heated back up, the cycle repeats 30 times, and the results are matched to a known genetic signature.
As speedy as the procedure is now, Wheeler thinks the team can go even faster.

"If I was told I would one day compete at the Olympic Games, I would never have believed it would be in the colors of Togo," Petitjean, who was a French junior-level skier, told the International Olympic Committee last December.
But because of a lack of mountains, snow, ice facilities or knowledge of winter sports, some of these Olympic newbies have stretched the limits of passport and citizenship requirements to field teams.
The Dominica husband and wife cross-country ski team, for example, hails from Staten Island, N.Y., not the Caribbean island the couple are representing in Sochi.
Gary and Angelica di Silvestri, accomplished skiers in their 40s, performed philanthropic work in the tiny Caribbean nation and were granted citizenship in return.
Paraguayan slopestyle skier Julia Marino was born in Paraguay, adopted by an American family and moved to the United States before she was less than a year old.

Prized South Korean speed skater Ahn Hyun-soo is competing in Sochi for Russia under the name Viktor Ahn after ditching his motherland for not sending him to the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver.
Olympic citizenship requirements are pliable enough, and some countries are hungry enough for Olympic attention and glory, that changing their passport is becoming the new normal among athletes.
"And countries will facilitate the growth of this pattern, too, in order to have representatives on the team so as to make their presence felt on the world stage," said Janice Forsythe, director of the International Centre for Olympic Studies at Western University in London, Ontario, Canada.
"We first got in touch with her in May 2013," Hyacinthe Edorh, head of Togolese mission at the Sochi Games, said of Petitjean.

In a week when U.S. drones rained missiles on alleged militants in Yemen, a sign that drone aircraft are coming to America landed less than a mile from the White House.
From bird-sized whirligigs to a scale model of a giant Air Force MQ-9 Reaper, known as a hunter-killer [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), the cavernous Washington Convention Center was packed with drones and other high-tech gizmos for both government and private uses.
The three-day trade fair, held by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, featured nearly 600 exhibits where they showed how drones and other robots can help in all sorts of domestic duties.
In fact, so quickly that aerospace company Aurora Flight Sciences showed off a craft inexpensive enough to be used in firefights, forest fires or other environments where it might not survive.
"All this is exactly as you would see in real life," said Becker.
They will be used to teach aviation students the concepts of drone operations, Becker said.
Panels at the conference discussed challenges facing the industry, including the shrinking defense budget and potential legal challenges from civil liberties groups and others if fleets of drones start flying over America.
"I can remember back to early on in Army aviation, we said, \'Unmanned systems, no way; it\'s got to have a man in it,\'" Barclay said.

The unmanned craft were also on display in a convention hall less than a mile from the White House.
Some Americans also worry about something flying overhead and spying on them.
Experts estimate that 10,000 unmanned aircraft could be flying five years later.

South African President Jacob Zuma visited the anti-apartheid hero in the hospital Thursday morning.
The crowd sang a deafening "Happy Birthday" to the strains of the brass band, in honor of Mandela.
South Africans were relieved to note that the statement, for the first time since Mandela\'s admission, no longer used the word "critical" to describe the elder statesman\'s health.
"On behalf of government and all the people of South Africa, we wish Madiba a joyous 95th birthday.
We are proud to call this international icon our own as South Africans and wish him good health.
Other South Africans distributed food to the homeless, picked up rubbish, cycled to collect money for charity, cleaned hospitals or did work in homes for the elderly, disabled or orphans.
"I came today to wish our President Tata a speedy recovery," he said, referring to Mandela.
Since then, the heaps of flowers, artwork, posters and written tributes have spread along the wall and spilled down a nearby hill.

The eggs, which cost from $4.99 to $8.99 a dozen, are sold across the country in Whole Foods Markets and other natural-foods grocers, as well as in some mainstream stores, including Safeway and Kroger.
According to a survey commissioned by Vital Farms, fewer than half of consumers are familiar with the term "pasture-raised," and the majority thought that "cage-free" and "free-range" mean the birds have been raised outdoors.
Their pasture-raised organic eggs (the "organic" label means that any supplemental feed is certified organic) can cost as much as $8.99 a dozen compared with $4.69 for standard organic eggs.
In 2006, Michael Cox, a chicken farmer in northwest Arkansas, faced a choice that many farmers do: Grow or die.
His family had been raising chickens for three generations, first for agriculture behemoth Cargill and then for themselves.
What started as a farm outside Austin with just a few thousand birds now works with about 60 farms and produces 1.5 million eggs every week.
Founder and Chief Executive Matt O\'Hayer added: "Our job is to show people that an egg is not just an egg."
Free-range hens get an average of two square feet of outdoor space.
Kroger plans to offer Vital Farms eggs in nearly all of its stores by the end of the year.

Los Angeles-area real estate agent Ed Kaminsky has been feverishly calling anyone he might know who has an in with a Rams player or two.
All are competing to lock down part of the bonanza that comes with the relocation of an entire NFL organization.
The firm will be staffing up just to work on Rams relocation projects, helping players hire moving companies, have cars shipped across the country and research local schools, he said.
"Within the last six to eight months we\'ve really revved up our conversations," said Ikem Chukumerije, chief executive of area firm Westside Premier Estates.

"I\'m absolutely disgusted by it, but this is how our system works," said Luo, a 32-year-old math teacher turned activist who is campaigning against what he sees as Chinese society\'s pervasive culture of corruption.
Gift-giving has long been a staple of Chinese life, but the means and expectations are increasingly colliding with more modern anti-graft strictures.
The crackdown started in earnest last month with the beginning of the holiday season, which got underway with the Sept. 19 Mid-Autumn Festival and will conclude with the Lunar New Year at the end of January.
Or a $3 million villa on the French Riviera, the key piece of evidence in the bribery trial of former Chongqing Communist Party Secretary Bo Xilai, who was recently sentenced to life in prison.
The gift-giving tradition is an offshoot of the intensity of competition in China, where a large population fights for education, healthcare and jobs.
Activist Luo, who comes from a small northeastern city in Jilin province, said that his family paid 100,000 yuan \u2014 about $16,000 \u2014 in cash under the table at a public hospital two years ago when his grandfather was having surgery for colon cancer, although the medical care was nominally covered by his insurance.
Parents in his hometown have to pay at least $3,200 if they want to transfer their child to a better school, he added.
Although there is no organized movement against gift-giving, it is a popular subject on the Internet, with ambivalence expressed by those receiving as well as giving.
To highlight the problem of graft in government, Chinese activists have enlarged photographs of officials to zoom in on expensive watches that they would not be expected to afford on civil service salaries that run no more than $850 per month.
Each time a new leader comes in, he sets a fire and starts to crack down very hard on corruption," said Qiao Xinsheng, a professor at the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, which set up what it calls the Institute of Clean Governance.
"China has always been a society of guanxi," or connections, said Hu Xingdou, an economist at the Beijing Institute of Technology.
Hu, the economist, said that enforcement of anti-corruption laws in China remains selective at best.
We couldn\'t possibly hold all Chinese officials to the same standard because if we did, there would be no officials left standing," he said.

Researchers had previously estimated that the glacier cluster in the Amundsen Sea region of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would last for thousands of years.
The second study, conducted by researchers at the University of Washington, focused largely on the Thwaites Glacier.
By itself, the disappearance of the Thwaites could cause global sea levels to rise 2 feet.
Using satellite measurements and computer models, the Washington study determined that the Thwaites could melt in as little as 200 years or as long as 1,000 years.
If the entire ice sheet disappeared, the global sea level could rise by a catastrophic 15 feet.
"Eventually, this could lead to the demise of ice across Antarctica," Rignot said.

The Nashville-New York connection is made through the Country Music Association Foundation, which began in 2006 to help fund music education programs in Nashville and is branching out across the country.
In recent years, it has donated to the New York-based nonprofit Education Through Music, which helps provide music education to all students in 50 low-income elementary and middle schools in all five city boroughs.
It also works with Words &amp; Music, based out of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, which provides a curriculum for both music and language arts teachers to develop language skills through the art of songwriting.
Rose said she applied the same techniques she uses when collaborating with professionals.
Moesha Masters, 11, helped come up with the inspiration for the title.

In November, federal agents arrested a Georgia man who stands accused of printing more than $1 million in phony $50 bills.
Heath J. Kellogg and five other men, who are believed to be his accomplices, allegedly sold the fake money for real currency, or used it to purchase expensive items that they would later return for cash.
Authorities say Kellogg, a self-taught graphic artist, allegedly put paper through a printer to give it a yellowish tint.
By doing this, he was able to simulate the watermark.
The forgery was good, but not good enough to fool investigators from the U.S. Secret Service.
In fact, the Secret Service was established almost 150 years ago, after the Civil War, when counterfeiting was so common that almost one-third of the money in circulation was phony.
To combat counterfeiting, the Treasury Department includes many complicated details in its currency.
For example, new bills have color-shifting ink, which turns from copper to green when you tilt the bill.
Not all of the fake bills are produced in the United States.
Counterfeiting money is a serious crime and those found guilty of doing it face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.
Counterfeiting hurts innocent people because the government does not reimburse you if you receive a fake bill.
They should be the same shade as the green Treasury seal and they should be evenly spaced.
Look at the person pictured on the bill, such as Abraham Lincoln on the $5, or Andrew Jackson on the $20.
Examine the bill closely for extra-fine red and blue fibers embedded in the paper.
The agency is also responsible for investigating credit card fraud and other types of electronic crimes involving money.
Staying one step ahead of the counterfeit artists will take a fresh generation of technology-savvy agents and investigators.
The agency recommends that students who are interested in working for the Secret Service get a four-year college degree, be in good physical shape and have a record as a law-abiding citizen.

He then printed the front side of the money on one piece of paper.
The forgery was good, but not good enough to fool investigators from the U.S. Secret Service.
Does the portrait appear lifelike?
On counterfeit bills, the portrait looks flat and lifeless.
The agency is also responsible for investigating credit card fraud and other types of electronic crimes involving money.
In November, federal agents arrested a Georgia man accused of printing more than $1 million in phony $50 bills.
On a separate sheet of paper, he printed the back of the bill.
The Secret Service and the Treasury Department recommend that you learn about the security designs on our currency such as the watermarks and color-shifting ink.
Look at the person pictured on the bill such as Abraham Lincoln on the $5 or Andrew Jackson on the $20.
Examine the bill closely for extra-fine red and blue fibers that are part of the paper.
The papermaking process is secret.
Nowadays, we use cash less and less when we have to pay for things.

First, he printed the front side of the money on one piece of paper.
You probably know of the Secret Service.
Back then, counterfeiting was so common, one out of every three dollars was phony.
He used the soap to rub off the number five from $5 bills and reprint them as $100s.
He was arrested in November.
The Secret Service told The New York Times newspaper it recovered about $81 million in counterfeit money last year and arrested almost 2,500 people.

For decades, fifth-generation farmer Neal Briggs has looked east to the mighty Wasatch range and seen the promise of a verdant future.
Corona del Mar High School has palm trees, ocean breezes and a parking lot where students hustle out of shiny BMWs as they head to class.
"I think it\'s insulting \u2014 it demeans girls," said Andrea Fine, who is active in the school\'s PTA and the mother of two students, a boy and a girl.
" Over the weekend, school principal Kathy Scott sent an email to parents bringing the draft to their attention and urging them to dissuade their kids from participating.
"It is not OK for any student to be objectified or judged in any way," the letter said, adding that "this is not behavior that is consistent with our school\'s outstanding reputation."
Before the message was taken down, a tweet from one male participant proclaimed: "Many drafters on the prowl tomorrow for (hashtag)freeagents so dress nice ladies," the Orange County Register reported.
The email said that contrary to some reports, the female students were not ranked or rated.
She later founded a nonprofit group, Rewrite Beautiful, intended to prevent eating disorders.
"When you hear that over and over, it just becomes the norm.
" As she sees it, the pressure on high school girls to look perfect, particularly around prom season, is vastly more intense than when she was a student.
I think it has to do with a higher standard of achievement."
Zoe Nicholson, president of Newport Beach-based Pacific Shore National Organization for Women, objected to the draft but thinks the participating students did not intend harm.
Corona del Mar High School has palm trees, ocean breezes and a parking lot where students hustle out of shiny BMWs as they head to class.
Social media sites buzzed with the controversy, some decrying the prom draft as "creepy" and "sexist," though some Corona del Mar students have rallied to its defense.
Before the message was taken down, a tweet from one male participant proclaimed: "Many drafters on the prowl tomorrow for (hashtag)freeagents so dress nice ladies," the Orange County Register reported.
The ceremony "provides a solution for two guys who want to ask the same girl."

What about the girl in the room who isn\'t going to the prom or "the girl who didn\'t qualify for the draft?"
She said that during the cheating scandal she felt pressure to go easy on kids whose parents gave money to the school.
The latest scandal is an NFL-style "draft" to pick prom dates.
They "were generally applauded," said one email to the media.
The prom is a dance usually held at the end of the last year of high school.
But at another prom draft, a boy apparently paid $140 for a higher number.
She said it is not OK for any student to be judged like that.
She said, "When you hear that over and over, it just becomes the norm."

From the Green Monster to the Charles River, the bearded champions celebrated their improbable journey with another familiar sight in Boston.
Outfielder Jonny Gomes placed the trophy on the line and he and catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia held Red Sox jerseys with the words "BOSTON STRONG" and the number 617, the city\'s area code.
"To bring the World Series trophy to the finish line, I don\'t think that the story was written that way, but I was glad to be a part of it and put the exclamation point on it."
But not to Pedroia, a gritty leader of a closely knit team that won the title with a 6-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 6 on Wednesday night.
Some boats even had light brown carpeting cut into the shape of beards attached on the front.
The departure from Fenway was delayed when a flatbed truck carrying Dropkick Murphys, a band that had played at the ceremony, and heavy equipment became stuck in the turf along the first-base line.
A duck boat drove up in front of it and, with a tow rope between the vehicles, pulled the flatbed out of the ruts.

A Batman bib-and-booties costume for $14.99 caught the eye of Joanna Robles as she searched for something for her months-old son to wear while she holds him as she hands out candy on Halloween.
"His dad is really obsessed with superheroes," Robles said while strolling through a Spirit Halloween store outside Los Angeles.
"My wife gives me a budget for Halloween and I always exceed it," he quipped.
Once mostly the purview of children, Halloween has grown into a major consumer holiday that now includes 18- to 34-year-old millennials and older adults who seize the opportunity for a night of escapism.
"It\'s not just for kids trick-or-treating anymore," said Trisha Lombardo, a spokeswoman for Spirit Halloween, which has 1,150 temporary stores that operate just for the Halloween season.
"I post stuff after I pick out my outfit," especially on Facebook and Instagram, said Jessica Medina, 33, as she shopped at the Spirit Halloween store.
"The growth that\'s occurred in Halloween spending over the last 10 years has almost mirrored that of the growth in social media.
That\'s mainly because "Halloween is not a gift-giving holiday" much beyond candy for the kids, said National Retail Federation spokeswoman Kathy Grannis Allen.
Then there are the haunted theme-park attractions, such as Knott\'s "Scary Farm" and "Fright Fest" at Six Flags Entertainment Corp.\'s Magic Mountain, both in the Los Angeles area.

Officials in Washington, D.C., have rarely paid much attention to the Bureau of Indian Education, a dysfunctional government agency that is responsible for overseeing nearly 200 schools serving approximately 50,000 Native American children in 23 states.
But now that might be changing.
He says the money is critical for making sure Native American students can go to school in safe buildings.
In the 19th century, the federal government signed treaties with Native Americans promising that their children would have access to education.
However, the children that do go to tribal schools trail the performance of Native Americans who attend public schools \u2014 as well as the national average \u2014 by almost every academic measure.

After 36 years of space travel and months of heated debate among scientists, NASA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 has indeed left our solar system and had entered interstellar space more than a year ago.
At a Thursday news conference in Washington, officials said the belated confirmation was based on new "key" evidence involving space plasma density.
The antennas, which are connected to a radio transmitter, detect the oscillation, or vibration, of excited plasma particles.
Fortunately for Voyager scientists, the antennas picked up two long-lasting oscillations.
"We really needed to measure plasma to know if we were inside or outside the heliosphere.
Plasma density was increasing in a linear fashion as Voyager moved farther from the heliosphere and into the interstellar medium.
After 36 years of space travel and months of heated debate among scientists, NASA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 has indeed left our solar system and had entered interstellar space more than a year ago.
At a Thursday news conference in Washington, officials said the belated confirmation was based on new "key" evidence involving space plasma density.
Lead author Don Gurnett, an Iowa State plasma physicist and a Voyager project scientist, said the data showed conclusively that Voyager 1 had exited the heliopause \u2014 the bubble of hot, energetic particles that surrounds our sun and planets \u2014 and entered into a region of cold, dark space called the interstellar medium.
A functioning PLS would have been able to sense the rising density change as Voyager exited the heliosphere.
The only trouble is that something has to excite the plasma for it to "ring," something like a large solar flare.
After 36 years of space travel and months of heated debate among scientists, NASA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 has indeed left our solar system and had entered interstellar space more than a year ago.
However, NASA scientists said they could not be certain Voyager had left the solar system until surrounding magnetic fields changed direction.
Voyager does, however, have two plasma wave antennas that stretch from its base in a wide V shape.
After 36 years of space travel and months of heated debate among scientists, NASA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 has indeed left our solar system and had entered interstellar space more than a year ago.
The evidence was outlined in a paper published online Thursday in the journal Science.
Gurnett calculated that Voyager crossed the edge of the heliosphere, or heliopause, at or around Aug. 25, 2012.

At a Thursday news conference in Washington, officials said the belated confirmation was based on new key evidence involving space plasma density.
The first was in October and November of 2012 and the second was in April and May of this year.
After 36 years of space travel and months of heated debate among scientists, NASA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 left our solar system and indeed entered interstellar space more than a year ago.
It is traveling a different path and is expected to reach interstellar space sometime within the next several years.

SA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 indeed left our solar system and entered interstellar space after 36 years of space travel.
Then officials decided that the magnetic field change was not a necessary sign that the spacecraft had left the solar system after all.

The sister spacecraft was also launched in 1977.
SA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 indeed left our solar system and entered interstellar space after 36 years of space travel.
"Voyager has boldly gone where no probe has gone before, marking one of the most significant technological achievements" in scientific history, said NASA\'s John Grunsfeld.
That something can be a large solar flare.
SA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 indeed left our solar system.
It became the first spacecraft to enter deep outer space, or what is known as interstellar space.
This is a measure of the amount of electrons in gas that comes from our sun and other stars.
Lead author Don Gurnett said information from the spacecraft showed that Voyager 1 had exited the heliopause.
It entered into a region of cold, dark space called the interstellar medium.
The number of high-energy pieces from inside the heliosphere had plummeted.
But NASA scientists said they could not be certain Voyager had left the solar system until magnetic fields around it changed direction.
They decided that the magnetic field change was not necessary to show that the spacecraft had left the solar system after all.
The device makes an important measurement.
But voyager does have two antennas that stretch from its base in a wide V shape.
The antennas can tell how fast space plasma particles vibrate.

Alison E. Moyer, now a Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University, says the cigar-shaped "microbodies," just one-millionth of a meter long, might simply be impressions left by very old bacteria.
"You have these little structures that look very similar, and so we have to be careful," said Moyer, lead author of the paper published this month in the journal Scientific Reports.
The study has prompted a heated social media reaction from one researcher who favors the interpretation that the shapes are melanosomes, or bits of color.
Such give-and-take is found more frequently in paleontology than in some other fields of science, because the only sure way to answer certain questions about the ancient world would be to travel back in a time machine.
She compared the bacteria with the pigment granules inside the feathers, as well as with the oblong impressions found in fossilized feathers from winged dinosaurs.
The size, shape, and distribution of the fossil impressions suggested bacteria, though it is still possible that they were pigment granules, she said.
One showed cigar-shaped bacteria on a chicken feather, the other depicted similar-shaped impressions found in a fossil feather from Archaeopteryx.
"It\'s always good to take one step back," said Johan Lindgren, an associate professor at Lund University in Sweden.
Said Moyer, "There\'s a ton of work that needs to be done."
Scientists think the granules offer clues to the colors of winged dinosaurs.
At a glance, the dark shapes in the two images look about the same size.
"It\'s always good to take one step back," said Johan Lindgren, an associate professor at Lund University in Sweden.
Said Moyer, "There\'s a ton of work that needs to be done."
To the untrained eye, the graininess of the image makes it a bit hard to tell who is right.
The impressions are just one-millionth of a meter long.
One showed oval-shaped bacteria on a chicken feather, the other depicted similar-shaped impressions found in a feather from Archaeopteryx.
Shawkey argues that the bacteria on the chicken feathers are actually four times as long as the impressions in the Archaeopteryx feathers.
Another scientist who has interpreted the shapes as pigment granules thought the study was useful.
"It\'s always good to take one step back," said Johan Lindgren, a professor at Lund University in Sweden.
So how did the other scientists conclude anything about the color of dinosaur feathers?
"There\'s a ton of work that needs to be done," said Moyer.
Because that is impossible, Moyer found a living time machine: a chicken.
Paleontologists consider birds to be modern dinosaurs.
One showed oval-shaped bacteria on a chicken feather, the other depicted similar-shaped impressions found in a feather from Archaeopteryx.
Moyer counters that the bacteria are closer to twice the length of the impressions on the Archaeopteryx feathers.
Bacteria are tiny living things.
The size, shape, and other characteristics of the spots suggest they are bacteria.
The other showed similar-shaped impressions found in a feather from an Archaeopteryx.
He says they are four times as long as the impressions in the Archaeopteryx feathers.
When he was 3 years old, Mohammad Abdelhamid told his mother he was going to be a basketball player when he grew up.
She estimated her family spent more than $100,000 taking her eldest daughter around the country for weekly gymnastics competitions.

The latest figures released in mid-December by the Education Department showed wide disparities in graduation rates according to where students live.
The District of Columbia had the lowest rate, 61 percent.
For the nation, the graduation rate for the 2013-14 school year was up almost a percentage point from 81 percent the previous year, and was the highest rate since the department started using a new, uniform measure in 2010.
While noting progress among subgroups of students, the latest figures drew concern from groups campaigning for a 90 percent graduation rate by 2020.
But, he said in an interview, those gains are "not rapid enough to close these graduation gaps in a way that will get us to our goal" of a 90 percent national graduation rate.
The data showed that African-American and Hispanic students made progress closing the achievement gap with their white counterparts.
In 2008, the Bush administration ordered all states to begin using this method, moving to a calculation that required them to track each student individually.
The bones in the pits accumulated over about 200 years, they wrote.
Researchers emphasized several factors that suggest the remains belonged to cats that had developed a unique relationship with long-ago farmers.
The proximity of the two skeletons suggests the cat might have been tamed, experts say.
Unlike the Egyptian cats, which were often depicted sitting under chairs, the cats of Quanhucun were hardly house cats.
Once people gave up their wandering, hunter-gatherer ways, their agricultural settlements became virtual buffets for cats.
The proximity of the two skeletons suggests the cat might have been tamed, experts say.
Archaeologists working in China have found the first clear evidence of cats living among humans.
Today, every domestic cat in the world comes from a single type of Middle Eastern wildcat.
That raises the question of just how the cats got there.
Marshall and her partners hope upcoming DNA tests will clear up matters.
The discovery consisted of eight bones from at least two cats.
The bones in the pits piled up over about 200 years, they wrote.
Part of a jawbone from one of the Quanhucun cats has very worn teeth.
They can see whether its diet consisted mostly of plants or of meat.
Wildcats, they believe, were probably drawn to farming settlements.
There were plenty of food scraps available and a ready supply of rats and mice.
The closeness of the two skeletons to each other suggests the cat might have been tamed, experts say.
Archaeologists working in China have found the first clear evidence of cats living among humans.
Dogs had already been tamed by nomadic hunter-gatherers many thousands of years before.
Ancient humans probably allowed cats to stick around because they got rid of rats and mice.
Until now, the next-oldest record of cats living with people came from ancient Egypt.

Motorcycle thefts are on the decline, and of five major brands, only Harley-Davidson owners saw an uptick in the number of stolen bikes in 2013, new data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau show.
"We are not going to give up until she is home," the plea says.
You would be surprised at how many people don\'t have theft coverage," Morris said.
Motorcycle thefts are on the decline, and of five major brands, only Harley-Davidson owners saw an uptick in the number of stolen bikes in 2013, new data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau show.
The bar was packed with people, Bidwell said, and he had just shown the bike to some of them three minutes earlier.
That was down 1.5 percent compared with the previous year, even as bike sales increased.
The bike had $29,340 in accessories and had won nine custom motorcycle competitions.
Thirty-seven percent of the motorcycles reported stolen in the United States in 2013 were recovered.
Motorcycle thefts are on the decline overall, but Harley-Davidson owners should not let down their guard.
"We parked right in front of the bar \u2014 I was 15 feet" away from the bike, he said.
The thief, still not caught, can be seen on video driving away and nearly causing an accident.
Bikers beware: fewer motorcycles are being stolen across the United States, but Harleys are still a target of thieves.
Thousands of people have viewed the posting.
There are good ways to prevent theft, though: locks, alarms and parking your motorcycle in a secure place.

While same-sex marriage was already legal in more than three dozen states, the impact of the decision was immediately felt by gay and lesbian couples in the 13 mostly Southern and Midwestern states that still banned such unions.
A majority of Americans now support same-sex marriage, a reversal from just a few years ago.
"This court is not a legislature (and) our Constitution does not enact any theory of marriage," said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who took the rare step of reading his dissent in court.
Some had thought Roberts might join the majority, but he wrote a 29-page dissent to say why he thought the matter should be decided in the political arena.
Obergefell had sued the state of Ohio for refusing to recognize his marriage after his husband, John Arthur, died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined with Kennedy to make a majority in Obergefell vs. Hodges.
Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. also dissented.
That surge of support for gay marriage was set off two years ago when the high court struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and said the marriages of same-sex couples deserved equal dignity and respect under the law.
With the ruling we got today, we may have to continue to fight some of those battles in court."

The Supreme Court ruling giving gays and lesbians the right to marry marked a huge shift in law and public attitudes.
However, its meaning goes far beyond the battle for marriage equality.
They called it an effort by liberal justices to take over a matter that should be decided by state lawmakers.
Kennedy described the struggle for gay marriage as a matter of equal rights.
They wanted him to put discrimination against gay people on the same level as discrimination against racial minorities or women.
"That would have made it crystal clear that there are virtually no circumstances under which the government can discriminate against gays," Warbelow said.

The most famous mass extinction came from space, but the biggest might have been because of carbon dioxide.
According to another new analysis in Science, people have physically moved 424 species of plants and animals to protect them from extinction.
For example, European sailors ate their way through the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius, killing off the dodo and the local tortoise species.
Based on an estimate published in Nature in 2011, we have a century or two at present rates before our depredations assure a mass extinction.
No disrespect to the cigar-chomping, wartime prime minister, they say.
Yet nobody of their gender has been deemed worthy of being added onto British money, a situation that Caroline Criado-Perez finds morally bankrupt.
Instead, activists and columnists kept up a cold shower of criticism, even after King hinted, before stepping down at the end of June, that novelist Jane Austen was strongly in the running to supplant Charles Darwin on the 10-pound bill.
Its longest-serving monarch was a woman (Queen Victoria), whose record of nearly 64 years on the throne may soon be beaten by another woman (Elizabeth II).
Even Criado-Perez confesses to knowing little about her or her work in penal reform.
But there are plenty of other women, both well-known and unsung, who have made important contributions to British or world history and deserve a spot on a bank note, activists say.
"Let\'s not forget the Queen wouldn\'t even be there if she\'d had a brother," Caroline Criado-Perez, a freelance journalist, said.
The note is worth about $7.50.
Churchill is well-known as the Prime Minister who led the country as it battled Nazi Germany in World War II.

The Postal Service lost $1.9 billion between January and March, and $15.9 billion last year.
But the savings have not been enough to match the drop in revenue.
"We are in real trouble, and we need comprehensive postal reform yesterday," Mickey Barnett, chairman of the Postal Service Board of Governors, told a congressional committee last month.
A legislative proposal to replace doorstep delivery with curbside delivery, which would save $4.5 billion, failed last year.
The year after the act was passed, Postal Service ledgers showed a loss of $5.1 billion.
Technology has brought positive changes along with the difficult ones: Package delivery has increased 14 percent in recent years as more people shop online.
But the savings have not been enough to match the drop in revenue.
The Postal Service and unions agreed to the 2006 legislation because at the time it looked as if the service could afford it, said congressional and union staffers.

As part of a major overhaul of the SAT college entrance exam, test-takers starting in 2016 will no longer be required to write an essay, the College Board announced Wednesday.
For example, the revised sections in reading will drop their most obscure vocabulary words and instead "focus on words students will use over and over again," said College Board President David Coleman.
The math problems will be less theoretical and more linked to real-life questions.
However, some experts said making the essay optional sends a bad and perplexing message.
"I\'m not sure it is a good signal to kids in schools about the importance of writing," said Katy Murphy, president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.
Now test takers are allowed to use calculators throughout the math questions.
Another change will be that the SAT will start to be offered online as well as in the traditional paper form.

Rare, striking and never-before-seen portraits of black citizens in Victorian-era England are going on display for the first time in the U.S., and organizers say the photographs have a powerful message for contemporary Americans riven by racism.
"There\'s a healing aspect to seeing these exquisite images," said Vera Ingrid Grant, director of the Cooper Gallery of African &amp; African American Art at Harvard University.
Life-size black-and-white prints are interspersed with small snapshots, some culled from privately owned collections.
They show ordinary people and a few minor celebrities posing for portraits in their Sunday best.
Together, they help write what Grant calls a "missing chapter:" that blacks of the era not only were very present in daily public life but also prospered and enjoyed a certain dignity and social status.
Many of the more than 100 photographs on display were taken for "cartes de visite," or calling cards: small, wildly popular postcards with an emblematic image and a splash of text.
The photos alter our understanding of the past, she said, and in turn, that fresh understanding can "change how we view the present."
The show features both ordinary and prominent citizens, from students and businessmen to artists, military men, missionaries and international royalty.
The collection of photos was originally put together by London art historian and photography expert Ren\xe9e Mussai.

S ANGELES - A hoax science paper written to expose lazy or unscrupulous academic publishers was accepted for publication by a shocking 157 open-access science journals recently.
Despite these and other problems, a whopping 157 journals accepted it; only 98 rejected it.

Despite these and other problems, a whopping 157 journals accepted it; only 98 rejected it.
S ANGELES - A science paper was recently accepted by 157 science journals.

To test the correctness of these journals, Bohannon created a flawed study on a cure for cancer.
The paper contained mistakes in the experiment.
A proper review should have found the mistakes.

The Florida bonneted bat is such a rare animal that scientists know of only one group of them in the wild.
Her group of volunteers found a group of bats near the Gables Granada Golf Course.
Some bats pollinate plants and others, including the bonneted bat, eat large amounts of insects.
In 2014, Bohn helped write a study about bat singing.
They sing from their nests and they sing when they fly.
At their first bat night at the golf course, hundreds of volunteers wandered around or sat in lawn chairs gazing into the night sky.
In the past year, Bohn and volunteers studied calls and the comings and goings of bats.
She hopes volunteers in Florida will carry on, to provide more information so she can continue her research.

Frank Ridgely recently released the first bonneted bat raised at the Miami zoo.
The government wants to create a special habitat, an area where the bats will live safely.
Ridgely said tougher steps must be taken to help the bats survive.
Florida scientists knew bats came to the Granada golf course to feed.
Counting them during colder months could get the wrong information.
She hopes volunteers in Florida will keep recording, so she can continue her study.
Voters in Maine this month passed a measure to strengthen their 1996 campaign finance law by making additional public money available to candidates running for governor and the Legislature.
Congress instead opted to let voters check a box on their taxes to donate $1 toward the public financing of campaigns.
Mahon and others also suggest that the release of the vouchers early in each election year will benefit incumbents and well-known candidates with political machines ready to start collecting them.
That could be an unfair advantage.

Top-secret drone operations by the United States have killed hundreds of suspected terrorists around the world and the use of the unmanned aircraft is highly controversial.
Hundreds of the endangered animals are being killed for their horns every year.
Professor Tom Snitch thinks that using drones could be an invaluable tool in catching the poachers.
He thought he might be able to use his mapping knowledge to help crack down on poachers.
But he will begin working over the next few days on a private farm next to the park.
The project will gather information about previous poachings and plug it into a mathematical formula.
This data will include the weather, the number of poachers working, and exactly where they were in the park.
And then you put animal movement patterns on top of it," the potential rhino protector added.

"If I had to deal with half the things they do at that age, I\'d have given up long ago," Dupuis said of her city students.
Officials also are trying to raise money to expand the program into more impoverished Chicago neighborhoods.
The program currently enrolls more than 70 KIPP students, ages 7 to 10.
For example, they must display responsible behavior in the classroom and complete homework assignments.
Dupuis said the children are also given a violin, a song book and a handbook for parents so they can practice at home.
She said she learned to play the viola with private lessons as a child growing up in Glenview, one of the wealthy suburbs where Dupuis also teaches.
"These kids are so brave, so strong and they work so hard," said Dupuis.
Parents attend all the lessons and become "home teachers" for their children.

Partly because of its Canadian roots, hockey for years has been watched and played primarily by whites, experts said.
There have been more minorities on NHL rosters in recent years \u2014 peaking at 50 in 2009 \u2014 than in the decades before.
The percentage of fans who are minorities is up, though slightly, the league said.
But the league has tried to increase interest in the game by reaching out to youth in urban communities.
The  league is getting exposure in new Chicago neighborhoods by other means, too.
There are few opportunities to learn the rules of the game and even fewer opportunities for minorities to play, said Richard Lapchick of the University of Central Florida.
"Once there are some African-American star players in the game that will help.
The cost of the sport is another deterrent, experts said.
"The problem with hockey is that it\'s not a sport you can go in your backyard and play," said Jimmy Terracino, director of operations at the Bobby Hull Ice Rink in Cicero, Ill.. "You\'ve got to have an ice rink.
Still, in the Chicago area there are efforts to develop interest in the sport among minorities.
Vic Ortiz, who is Mexican-American and lives on the South Side, considers himself an avid Chicago sports fan.
But for years, he took little interest in the Blackhawks because the games were too expensive and most of the home games were not televised, he said.
Gertrude Johnson,  who is African-American and lives on the Near North Side, grew up watching the Bears and Bulls, she said.
Initially attracted by the fights, she learned the rules of the game, admiring the speed of the players and the way they stick up for and protect each other.
"Anybody who is making a name for Chicago, we\'re riding with them," Johnson said, adding, "People are saying, \'damn, the Blackhawks are doing good.\'"
When the Chicago Blackhawks take the ice, Michelle Secor is dressed in her team clothing, watching every face-off, power play and goal.
Secor, who is of Mexican descent, is one of a small but growing number of minorities who have become hooked on hockey.
"It makes us all feel good to see a Chicago team out there winning \u2014 race doesn\'t matter," she said.
Of that, 9.4 percent are Latino, while about 8.3 percent of U.S. hockey fans are African-American.

If state and federal biologists are right, OR7 and his mystery mate would be the first known wolves to breed in the Oregon Cascades since the early 20th century.
At 6:30 a.m., OR7 was photographed sauntering by one of the remote cameras.
Now, with wolf packs solidly re-established and widely ranging in the West, state wildlife officials say it is reasonable to conclude California will host a functional wolf population within 10 years.
He\'s certainly been there and checked it out."
This month, they captured photographs of a black wolf squatting to urinate.
The two wolves had never been photographed together, which made their relationship especially hard to confirm.

The endangered young wolf searched for thousands of miles to find a partner.
If biologists are right, the wolf and his mystery mate would be the first known wolves to breed in the Oregon Cascades in 100 years.
"OR7 is over 250 miles from the nearest known wolf pack," said John Stephenson, a wolf biologist from Oregon who has been monitoring the animal.
He was the first gray wolf documented in the state since 1924.

Cuban blogger Yoani Sanchez says her planned digital newspaper is just weeks away from its debut, with a dozen staffers getting last minute training and looking for novel ways to distribute the reports with text messages, emails and digital memory devices.
The publication, which she prefers to call a "new media," will include the usual news as well as investigative reports, sports, interviews and profiles, Sanchez told the Hispanicize conference Tuesday at the Intercontinental Hotel in downtown Miami.
She hopes the publication will be inserted into so-called Combos, which are DVDs and other large memory formats recorded with massive amounts of information such as movies and telenovelas and regularly passed around hand-to-hand in Cuba these days.
Sanchez drew laughs when she noted that since the Cuban government refuses to issue work permits for independent journalists \u2014 those who do not want to work for the state monopoly \u2014 she obtained a license for the closest type of work, typist.

"We\'re not seeing any evidence of declining growth rates," said Steve Sillett, a forestry professor and nationally known redwoods expert.
But so far that lack of fog may have allowed more sunlight to reach the trees, said Todd Dawson, a lead scientist on the team.
They used lasers to help measure the heights of trees, complex studies of isotopes to re-create the weather from centuries ago, and core samples to learn the ages and growth rates of the trees.
As part of the latest study, he discovered the oldest known coast redwood tree in existence, a tree in northern California that is at least 2,520 years old.
Recent modeling by researchers at the California Academy of Sciences shows that if that rate of increase keeps up, temperatures, rainfall and fog levels at the southern end of the redwood range in Monterey and Santa Cruz counties will become unsuitable to support redwoods by 2100.
So the project, which is seeking new funding, will need to study how seedlings and trees on the edges of the redwood range fare as the climate continues to change, Dawson said.
Climate change is melting glaciers, worsening droughts and raising sea levels around the world.
Or they might even be responding well to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Decades of work to limit forest fires may also be helping.
Or the trees might even be responding well to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Giant sequoias are the biological cousins of coast redwoods and live in the Sierra Nevada mountains.
One thing that will happen is there will be less densely packed snow.
That means less water for giant sequoias, he pointed out.
A lifetime of moving has taught Claudia Morales to start packing early, because like many 13-year-olds, her room "is always a mess."
Eventually, about 90 percent of kids living in seasonal worker housing drop out of school, according to the San Jose-based nonprofit human rights organization Human Agenda.

"They come every day, these sad parents, begging me to take their children to school," said Etaf Seif Abdel Samad, the principal of a public grade school in Beirut, where Syrian children learn with the Lebanese side by side.
She added: "They\'ve lost everything in Syria and all they have in Lebanon is the interest in their children\'s future."
More than 2 million of those who should be in school remain in Syria, where classrooms have been bombed, used as shelters or turned into military barracks.
The conflict has unleashed massive suffering across all segments of Syrian society, but the impact on children has been especially acute.
With no end to fighting in sight, Syrian refugees are increasingly desperate to have their children obtain the most basic education.

Kansas said biometric data cannot be collected without student or parental consent.
Jay Fry, CEO of the biometric-in-schools company identiMetrics, said biometric identification is used in more than 1,000 school districts in 40 states from Alaska to Long Island, New York.
In cafeterias, for example, schools can replace traditional student ID cards with machines that can read small, identifiable portions of an index-fingerprint.
We want to know exactly how it\'s being used \u2026 so we don\'t sacrifice too much privacy."

Sweet Briar and Deep Springs colleges have names that remind people of pleasant country settings.
The people who run 114-year-old Sweet Briar said in February that the school would close this summer.
They said that even letting men enroll in the school would not help.
Many go on to attend top colleges for four-year degrees.
Men-only colleges, they argue, can help close that gap by giving special attention to those students.
One of these doors would possibly lead to a storeroom, Reeves said.
The theory would take many more tests to confirm, although a radar scan could quickly reveal any hollows, an archaeologist told the Economist.
"If I\'m wrong, I\'m wrong," Reeves said to the Economist.
Carter first found it filled with thousands of priceless treasures \u2014 safe from the tomb robbers who ravaged items found in other chambers because of how well it was hidden.
Tutankhamun is believed to have only ruled for nine years, taking power only as a young boy.
Thanks to rounds of royal inbreeding, he had a club foot and could only walk with a cane.
There are rumors of the "Pharaoh\'s Curse," which brings bad luck to those who disturb the tombs.
Eady, better known as Omm Sety, openly believed that she was an ancient Egyptian priestess in a past life who had been reincarnated in the modern age.

Nefertiti, the ancient Egyptian queen, has long been at the center of a fantastic mystery.
Now, however, an archaeologist named Nicholas Reeves claims he has found her secret tomb in the Valley of the Kings.
It is comprised of four rooms, but it is much smaller than those of other pharaohs.
It had remained safe from the tomb robbers who ravaged items found in other chambers because of how well it was hidden.
The queen, famed for her beauty, served as co-ruler with King Akhenaten, her husband, and may have been a pharaoh after his death.

Beyond Meat and other makers of such substitutes are chasing increasingly discerning palates by cooking up grub that captures more of the bite and appearance of animal flesh.
Janet Corvin, 52, has been a vegetarian since she was a child but still desires the taste and texture \u2014 the mouth-feel \u2014 of meat.
"Yet we can\'t ask everyone to become vegetarians.
A Gallup poll last year placed the percentage of vegetarians in the U.S. at 5 percent, down slightly from 6 percent in 1999.
"While I know there are some amazing food scientists out there who can achieve great results, it\'s hard for me to imagine that tofu or tempeh will compete with T-bones any time soon among people who enjoy the beefy taste and texture of a steak," said Janet Riley, a spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute.
The team developed a technique that broke down soy proteins by alternating high temperatures with high pressure.
Pressed through a large, stainless steel extruder, the manipulated proteins ooze out like pale Play-Doh.

Reflecting the urgency and scale scientists have called for to cope with climate change, the U.S. and Chinese presidents laid out ambitious new targets Wednesday to cut pollution in a deal that negotiators hope will inspire similarly dramatic commitments from other countries.
At a news conference in the Chinese capital, President Barack Obama said he had agreed that the U.S. would cut net greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent by 2025, doubling its current pace of carbon reduction.
The deal portends significant change for the climate, observers said, as it sets a bolder timeline for two countries that, together, account for more than a third of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Those are the kinds of reductions scientists have recommended to avert the greatest temperature rises associated with climate change.
At a U.N. summit in September to kick off the drafting of an international climate change accord, Obama spoke bluntly of American responsibility for global warming and pledged to unveil ambitious steps over the next year to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Following him at the summit was Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, who said China would put forth a plan in early 2015 to put a cap on its greenhouse gases "as soon as possible" and scale back emissions thereafter.

Decked with balloons and cheerful signs, Israeli schools opened their gates Monday as 2 million children returned to school in a welcome sign of normality after the Gaza war.
Describing the summer as "loud," his mother, Enav Neardea, said her children mostly took the rockets and sirens in stride, even when they disrupted their activities at the playground or swimming pool.
Environment Minister Amir Peretz, who voted against the cut, said it would hit weaker Israelis "directly in the pocket."
While it is true that the government promised to refrain from new taxes, he said, it should acknowledge that an unexpected event had taken place and "have enough courage to impose a temporary tax that would spread the burden more equally."

But this was not an entirely normal first day of school.
Israeli children returned to school Monday in a welcome sign that life was returning back to normal after the Gaza war.
This year, though, emotions were mixed.
In Israel, students will be eased back with two weeks of discussions about their experiences during the war.
Many of them visited schools in the southern towns, which were hardest hit by rocket fire from Gaza.
At age 5, kindergartner Daniel Neardea of Rishon LeZion recognizes the different sounds of incoming rockets and Iron Dome interceptors.
Daniel can also identify the head of the Israeli army and the top Hamas political leaders.
Still, many parents argue that the Israeli government does not spend enough money on education.
She noted that tourism, business and most other areas were also suffering.
Peretz said the government should "have enough courage to impose a temporary tax" on everyone.

"I guess they understand this is part of their lives now," Neardea said.
She said she was relieved to have her children back in school.
They said that would be a fairer way to pay for the war.
Money should not be taken from government services, they said.
The citizens who need these services, like food or shelter, will suffer.
The appearance of the deadly Ebola virus in the United States has rattled Americans and raised questions about whether a weary White House can handle several crises at once.
"I don\'t expect the president to wake up tomorrow morning and view the world any differently," McConnell said.
"He knows I won\'t, either."
"There would have to be some really exceptional set of events to get people who have shown no interest in cooperating to get something done," said Ken Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison who studies the presidency.
He spent the last two days leading up to Election Day in meetings at the White House.
"I think there is a fork in the road.
"I don\'t expect the president to wake up tomorrow morning and view the world any differently," McConnell said.
"He knows I won\'t, either."
"There are ways to bridge the differences," Duberstein said.
The new Republican-led Senate will begin in January, as will the House of Representatives with a bigger Republican majority.
McConnell said, "I don\'t expect the president to wake up tomorrow morning and view the world any differently."
Obama will become "yesterday\'s news" as soon as the 2016 presidential race begins, said New Hampshire State Senator Lou D\'Allesandro, who is a Democrat.
Biden said he thinks the Republicans might be also willing "because the message from the people, and I\'m getting it all over the country, is they\'re tired of Washington not being able to do anything."
Since the Republicans are not very popular either, they have good reason "to show they can do business."
The United States was capitalist, emphasizing free markets and trade.
In many ways, life is better today for Germans who live in eastern Germany.
Today, Ossies, as former East German residents are called, suffer from higher unemployment, are paid less, have far less in savings, and receive lower retirement pensions than Germans in the former West.
Employees at a shopping mall in East Berlin make $1,400 a year less than employees across the street at another mall in West Berlin.
The problem started because of a basic difference between capitalism and communism \u2014 the importance of personal property.
As communism took over more and more control of East Germany in the 1950s, many people moved to the West.
Some made plans for their homes and gardens, but many just abandoned them.

Warnick won the right to stay, after paying about $180,000 to the previous owner and lawyers.
"I spent years kicking myself for not changing the land records, but we were naive," he said.
Then, in a sudden and dramatic binge of brilliant, all-night action, the roiling masterpiece issued forth.
Collector and art dealer Peggy Guggenheim commissioned the mural in the summer of 1943 for the entry hall of her East 61st Street Manhattan townhouse.
She was planning a November Pollock show for her gallery, "Art of This Century," and the mural would be an epic statement of her faith in a mercurial, barely known talent.
"As soon as the paint was dry to the touch, Jackson broke down the stretcher, rolled the canvas, and transported both to Peggy\'s apartment building," Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith wrote in "Jackson Pollock: An American Saga," their controversial, Pulitzer Prize-winning 1990 biography.
With its small but highly detailed book, it shows that Pollock did lay out an initial overall composition, painting wet-on-wet in diluted, high-quality oils of teal, lemon yellow, red and umber.
Fluffing an image of manly vigor surely had something to do with it.
Which begs a question: Does the demolition of a central tenet of the New York School\'s creation myth lessen "Mural\'s" critical importance \u2014 or Pollock\'s?
Over days (or weeks), he honed his own steadily maturing aesthetic.
By 9 a.m. the next morning, 15 tumultuous hours later, "Mural" was done.
Separate layers each required drying time, some for many days.
Myths die hard \u2014 especially origin myths.
In 1943 Pollock, then 31 years old, was an artist living in Greenwich Village in the midst of World War II, when most young American men were off fighting or at least wearing a uniform.
The rigorously constructed painting shows an artist who knew exactly what he was aiming for.
For a time, it put New York at the center of the art world, instead of Paris.
It also emphasized spontaneous creation \u2014 creating in the moment, without planning \u2014 and the process of painting itself.
That movement is Abstract Expressionism and the painting in question is Jackson Pollock\'s mammoth 1943 "Mural."
Still, the artist compared them to a chaotic stampede of mustang horses.
We now know that the painting in fact evolved over many days and perhaps even several weeks.
The huge painting would serve as a statement of her faith in a barely known talent.
In 1943 Pollock, then 31 years old, was an artist living in Greenwich Village in the midst of World War II.

The man was in apparent good health when he stepped off a commercial airliner Sept. 20 but began to feel sick four days later, said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Federal, state and local medical teams are now scrambling to locate individuals who were in close contact with the patient and may have been infected.
The Dallas resident said the crowded room watched closely and remained calm.
When she learned why they were there, she stopped short of the doors and scanned the building, wringing her hands as she weighed whether to go inside.
But Frieden said the patient had been in contact with only a handful of people after he became infectious.
A special team of CDC "disease detectives" and other experts have been dispatched to Texas to assist Dallas County Health and Human Services workers in tracing the patient\'s contacts.
If they show signs of a fever within that time, they will be isolated and tested for Ebola, officials said.
"There are no other suspected cases in the state of Texas at this time," said Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services.
Access to premium health care makes a widespread outbreak here highly unlikely.
"We have the ability to trace contacts, monitor people and to act quickly if any of them should start to exhibit symptoms," said Dr. Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.
Gaye said it would be better for public officials to release the names of confirmed Ebola patients so that others in the community could take precautions.
We see what is happening right now in Africa.
Frieden emphasized that the man did not become infectious until he began to develop active symptoms of the hemorrhagic fever.
The Dallas resident said the crowded room watched closely and remained calm.
Once those people are located, they will be monitored for 21 days.
"I have no doubt that we will control this importation of Ebola so that it does not spread widely in this country," Frieden said.

Frieden did say the patient had been in contact with only a handful of people after he became contagious.
Officials would not say which flights the patient took from Liberia.
The country is one of the three African nations now battling the worst Ebola epidemic in history.
But Frieden said other passengers on the airplane would not have been at risk because the patient had no symptoms at the time of the flight.

SHINGTON \u2013 On Tuesday, President Barack Obama announced his plans to move quickly in bringing high-speed Internet to American public schools.
Obama made the remarks as he unveiled plans to speed up the start of his pet project.
Several U.S. companies, including Apple, AT&amp;T, Microsoft, Sprint and Verizon, are pitching in about $750 million in goods and services to help students get connected to the World Wide Web.
Back then, administration officials expected that the FCC would have to go through a lengthy rule-making process to free up $2 billion.
Right now, that money is in a fund already dedicated to building capacity for high-speed Internet.
The challenge showed Obama using his new second-term strategy.
SHINGTON \u2013 On Tuesday, President Barack Obama announced his plans to move quickly in bringing high-speed Internet to American public schools.

SHINGTON \u2013 On Tuesday, President Barack Obama announced his plans to move quickly in bringing high-speed Internet to American public schools.
For about 20 million students, the money will mean they can get Wi-Fi in their schools and libraries over the next two years.
It is a lot sooner than Obama anticipated when he launched his "ConnectED" plan last year.
Back then, White House officials expected that the FCC would have to go through a long rule-making process to get access to $2 billion.
But the FCC recently decided it could give out the money faster.
This will speed up the funding of high-speed Internet projects without having to vote on it.
But the president also warned lawmakers that he was about to ask them to pitch in.
"I\'m going to ask every business leader to join us in this effort," President Obama said, "to give every young person every shot at success."

SHINGTON \u2013 President Barack Obama says he wants to move quickly to bring fast Internet to American public schools.
He said he wants to make sure students in the United States have the same advantages that students in other countries have.
The sped-up timeline comes without a single vote from the rest of the government.
Obama has had problems in getting some members of the government to agree on plans.
He said he would ask Congress to give teachers the cutting-edge technology they deserve.
Yet the school in rural west Fresno County has achieved something remarkable among its San Joaquin Valley peers.
"Our students have grit," said Kassie Dewey, an agriculture science teacher and Laton\'s FFA adviser.
Already, Laton has replaced its traditional science classes with ag science and has encouraged participation in FFA.
The students on the competitive teams spend lots of time together, practicing and at competitions.
The students say that as part of being on an FFA team, they have also been given the chance to travel and visit college campuses.
Laton High School is neither large nor rich.
It goes well beyond showing an animal."
Although she was a natural, she was competing against 130 other FFA students from much bigger schools who had competed before.
The school has just 175 students.
She is one of three agriculture teachers at the school and part of the change happening to make agriculture the main subject that the school teaches.
The students say they have also been given the chance to travel and visit college campuses.

The other study, from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focused on the U.S. industrialized food chain.

Two new studies have found that beef is unhealthy \u2014 for planet Earth.
Beef cattle produced more than half the emissions.

Astronauts are not the only life forms inhabiting the International Space Station.
More work needs to be done to see exactly how many of these pathogenic microbes are aboard the space station, and if they are virulent, meaning if they are making toxins.
The study provides a baseline full spectrum of the microbes on the space station, but there is still more work to be done.
A new analysis of the life forms living on the space station found that there are more organisms living there than there are in the carefully controlled clean rooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Earth.
The results of the analysis were published in the journal Microbiome.
However, that technique has some flaws.
As NASA looks to long-term manned missions like sending people to Mars, the agency wants to learn as much as possible about the microscopic community that might tag along.

In the buildup to the World Cup, the Brazilian soccer catchphrase of "Jogo Bonito" \u2014 The Beautiful Game \u2014 was drowned out by the bangs of frantic construction work and the shouts of angry protesters.
Many people expected patched-up stadiums and large street demonstrations and worried that the return of the World Cup to the spiritual home of football after 64 years could be the most troubled in recent memory.
At that rate, it will be the highest-scoring since Brazil began its great love affair with the tournament and \u2014 with a 17-year-old Pele up front \u2014 won the first of its record five titles in Sweden in 1958.
The Netherlands made a mockery of pre-tournament criticism of their formation switch with blisteringly fast, attacking play to blow away defending champion Spain 5-1.
Even Bosnia, the World Cup debutant, aggressively took the fight to Messi and Argentina \u2014 as coach Safet Susic promised they would.
The fans have reacted by filling stadiums or fan fests and embracing the carefree culture: A group of middle-aged German men in super-tight swimming outfits and with bellies bulging played soccer on Copacabana Monday morning before heading for the big-screen TV.
The lights came back on, stayed on, and Neymar rescued Brazil with a double as the home favorite came back from 1-0 down to beat Croatia 3-1.
"It\'s a big party," Netherlands supporter Rolleman said on Copacabana.
The games have been open, attacking and packed full of goals and great moments.
"It\'s crazy that I\'ve been able to do this," said Elana Simon of New York City, describing her idea to study the extremely rare form of liver cancer that mostly hits adolescents and young adults.

The crash left officials and families across Europe in shock.
Sobbing, grieving relatives at both airports were led away by airport workers and crisis counselors.
Photos of crash site from the La Provence newspaper showed scattered black flecks across a mountain and several larger airplane body sections with windows, five in one chunk and four in another.
No one can access the site from the ground," Gilbert Sauvan, a lawmaker and president of the general council, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, told The Associated Press.
Officials believe 67 German nationals were on board, including 16 high school students on an exchange program from the German town of Haltern.
It was short noise and lasted just a few seconds," Sandrine Boisse, the president of the Pra Loup tourism office, told The Associated Press.
Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told BFM television he expected "an extremely long and extremely difficult" search-and-rescue operation because of the area\'s remoteness.
The weather in the area deteriorated Tuesday afternoon, with a chilly rain falling.
"We cannot say at the moment why our colleague went into the descent, and so quickly and without previously consulting air traffic control," said Germanwings\' director of flight operations, Stefan-Kenan Scheib.
The plane last underwent a routine check in Duesseldorf on Monday, and its last regular full check took place in the summer of 2013.
The owner of a campground near the crash site, Pierre Polizzi, said he heard the plane making curious noises shortly before it crashed.
"The noise I heard was long \u2014 like eight seconds \u2014 as if the plane was going more slowly than a military plane.

To understand earthquakes, scientists have hatched an audacious plan \u2014 go straight to the source.
"If we want to understand earthquakes, it\'s one of the few kind of direct ways we can get evidence about what faults are like," said Clifford Thurber, a professor in the department of geoscience at UW-Madison.
Thurber and Tobin are part of an international group of scientists working on the Deep Fault Drilling Project, an experiment studying the Alpine Fault in New Zealand.
Scientists therefore think the fault is due, estimating a 28 percent chance of a quake in the next 50 years.
As co-chief scientist of the Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) in Japan, Tobin spent seven weeks at sea last winter on a scientific drilling ship called the Chikyu, drilling into the Nankai Fault off the coast of southern Japan.
The UW researchers also were involved in an earlier experiment, the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD), completed in 2007.
The experiment recovered some of the first samples of rock from a fault at the depth where small earthquakes can originate.
The lessons scientists learned through their struggles with SAFOD will be applied to the experiments in New Zealand and Japan.
So we need to know as well as we can how they work and whether there are ways to mitigate their effects by early warning or detection," said Harold Tobin, a professor in the department of geoscience at UW-Madison.

The phenomenon begins deep below the surface of the Earth, too deep for researchers to go.
Then they will place instruments in the hole to measure seismic tremors and other important characteristics of the fault zone.

When their task was finished, Gzhemnidoo directed that they had to travel separate paths, but that they would remain linked.
When wolves were reviled, nearly wiped out and hunted for their fur by white settlers, the tribes lost much of their land to the same settlers, LaBine said.

The Air Force \u2014 better known for aerial dogfights and dropping GPS-guided bombs \u2014 would rather invest its diminishing funds elsewhere.
The Pentagon has yet to release its latest budget or officially signal that the Warthogs are on a kill list.
But last month, the Air Force disclosed that eliminating the fleet of 326 aircraft would save it about $3.5 billion over five years.
The military says it must slash, or "divest," its older arsenal to save money.
But because these entrenched programs support troops and provide thousands of jobs across many states, Congress has continually come to their rescue.
Sequestration cuts would reduce Pentagon spending $52 billion next year.
The A-10 was designed by Fairchild-Republic in the 1970s around the gun \u2014 the heaviest rotary cannon ever mounted on an aircraft.
The aircraft has been routinely upgraded over the years.
Known as the Joint Strike Fighter, the nearly $400 billion program for more than 2,400 jets is centered around a plan to develop a fighter plane that could \u2014 with a few tweaks \u2014 be used by the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.
The F-35 provides 127,000 direct and indirect jobs in 47 states and Puerto Rico.

But major savings \u2014 measured in billions rather than millions of dollars \u2014 can be made only by cutting an entire fleet, the Air Force has said.
But the plane is designed to keep flying even if parts of the wing or one of its engines has been blown to shreds.
The aircraft has been routinely upgraded over the years.
If budgets are going to be cut severely, where are the cuts going to come from: expensive new weapons that can carry out more missions, or aging, less-complex weapons?

The military says it must slash its older arsenal to save money.
But because these programs support troops and provide thousands of jobs across many states, Congress has always come to their rescue.
Pilots do that by laying down fire on enemy tanks, other vehicles and strongholds with its high-powered Gatling gun.
To do so, it must fly low and slow over the battlefield.

At first, the police shooting triggered a public outcry similar to the recent protests in Ferguson, Missouri.
Others, however, say that there are potential benefits, as seen in the Rialto case.
In Salt Lake City, for instance, an officer shot and killed a 20-year-old man two days after Brown was slain Aug. 9 in Ferguson.
On his first day as a commissioner last year, he said the cameras were important and vowed to raise private funds to bypass tight budgets and red tape.
"We\'re just waiting for the prosecutor to finish his investigation and then we\'ll release (the footage) as a public document," police Chief Chris Burbank said in a phone interview this week.
In Rialto, where 120 officers patrol 30 square miles and protect 105,000 residents, the number of police use-of-force events dropped 66 percent the first year cameras were worn.
The money went not only to purchase the devices \u2014 each cost about $1,200 \u2014 but also to run an internal website to store the images.

De Anda said they spent $100,000 on the cameras over the two years.
In the Ferguson case, it is still not clear why Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown at least six times.
In Rialto, 120 officers were given cameras in early 2012.
The money went not only to purchase the devices \u2014 each cost about $1,200 \u2014 but also to run a website to store the images.
In Utah, however, the officer was wearing a body camera.
When police shot and wounded a man in Rialto, California, in 2011, people got angry at first.
It looked as if there might be full-blown protests, like those seen recently in Ferguson, Missouri.
The video, he said, showed the real facts.
The Los Angeles Police Department is testing cameras.
Take a case that occurred last month in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Around the country, he said, about a dozen cities use cameras.
The goal is to eventually purchase about 500 cameras.

He has more than a dozen kids working for him, most of whom are right out of high school.
To call the Bakken an "oil patch" is deceiving, since it covers roughly 20,000 square miles \u2014 about the size of West Virginia.
Tethered to a cable that could hoist him out if things go wrong, Klefstad lowers himself into the pit.
The split-level house he stays in for work is in rough shape.
Kayla Williams lives a few houses down with her husband, Eli.
Williston Mayor Ward Koeser says "it\'s critical to have families here" if Williston is going to evolve with its oil industry.
Companies have started building fully furnished townhouses to woo families to join their oil workers.
Garcetti, like the past mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, speaks a version of the language that, for lack of a more scientific term, might be called Funky American Business Spanish.
Villaraigosa and Garcetti have Latino roots, but both had to learn much of their Spanish in school, on the stump or on the job.
As a result, they speak a serviceable but far from perfect Spanish, a shortcoming each has acknowledged with admirable good humor.
On Tuesday, Garcetti, whose grandfather on his father\'s side was born in Mexico, referred to his language skills as "good community meeting Spanish."
If Garcetti had been speaking French on a diplomatic mission to Paris, he might have been harangued \u2014 or even hanged \u2014 for his errors, some say jokingly.
His parents, like many Latino parents at the time, saw the widespread prejudice against Spanish speakers and decided it best that their son join the English speakers.
"I know I\'m limited," Cedillo said.
And the largest number of foreign tourists to L.A. are from Mexico.
On Monday, Garcetti visited the National Autonomous University of Mexico, celebrating its plans to partner with Cal State Northridge in creating a new Center for Mexico and Latin American Studies at the California school.
On Wednesday, he was scheduled to inaugurate a new exchange program between Loyola Marymount University and the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.
Eric Garcetti was the second Spanish-speaking LA mayor in a row to make an official visit to the Mexican capital.
It so happened that the Mexican media was just as eager as his hometown voters to chat him up.
"Yesterday I think I did 15 individual interviews" in Spanish, Garcetti said in an interview Tuesday morning.
His answers were also peppered with the kinds of little mistakes that his 11th-grade Spanish teacher would have marked, lightly, in red pen.
Later, making a reference to the "social fabric," Garcetti said what sounded like the "fabrica social" (in Spanish, "el tejido social"), which could be translated as "the social manufacturing plant."
Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, recently made an official visit to the Mexican capital, making him the second Spanish-speaking LA mayor in a row to do so.
Villaraigosa and Garcetti have Latino roots, but both had to learn much of their Spanish in school or on the job.
During a 2009 visit to Mexico City, Villaraigosa referred to himself jokingly as "el pochito".
He emphasized his Mexican background even as some well-known local Latino leaders rallied behind his opponent.
A recently released study from researchers at the University of Texas warned that the current depletion rate of the Central Valley aquifer, the large storage of underground water farmers use for irrigation, is unsustainable \u2014 even when wet years follow dry ones.
"Annie and Jeff\'s apricots are worth any price," said Cultrera.
One farmer who still dry-farms today is Fritz Durst, who owns Tule Farm in Yolo County, California, where he grows garbanzo beans, wheat, safflower and other crops as dry-farmed crops.
The technique is as simple as it is risky.
Used for centuries in the Mediterranean region to grow crops like olives and grapes, the technique is not for the faint of heart.
"Dry farming would be a hard life because you\'re at the whim of the rains," said Jay Lund, director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California-Davis.
Many are small farmers and vintners who either lack irrigated water or believe that dry farming produces better-tasting fruits and vegetables.
"I think people are interested in the idea," said David Runsten, policy director of the Community Alliance with Family Farmers.
Runsten recently promoted dry farming to a consortium of California farmers.
Currently, nearly half a million acres of land are devoted to wine grapes in California.
Of those, about 2,000 acres are dry-farmed; the rest are drip-irrigated, said Runsten.
He said he saw the superiority of dry-farmed fruit when he dry-farmed a 100-year-old heirloom apricot orchard alongside Putah Creek, just west of Winters, California, between 2003 and 2010.
The store expects to sell potatoes and tomatoes that come from farms using the dry-farm method, said Kerri Williams, produce manager at the Co-op.
The Co-op sold the tomatoes last year and will offer them again in late summer.
Typically, dry-farmed fruit grows much smaller than fruit from irrigated farms, and the yield is also smaller.
"You still find that people buy with their eyes," Maine said, "unless you can get the message to them with marketing, before they get to the point of purchase."
"There is no irrigation here, only rainwater in this area," said Durst, a fifth-generation farmer.
"What we\'ve done is we\'ve adapted to the rainfall," said Durst.
Currently, nearly half a million acres of land are devoted to wine grapes in California.
"The dry-farmed stuff has a whole different flavor," said Maine, who co-owns the farm Good Humus Produce, with wife Anne Maine.
"There is no irrigation here, only rainwater in this area," said Durst, a fifth-generation farmer.
That moisture, however small, keeps his crops alive throughout the dry season.

But he believes irrigation has its own problems.
The farmer slowly walked up the hill toward her barn, with her driver following behind in the minivan.
The paratroops had taken back control of the tower from gunmen two days before.
But now, as the separatists in Slovyansk are surrounded by Ukrainian security forces, her whole enterprise is at risk of collapse.
Vitaly Kolesnik, the supply chief for the Slovyansk electrical district, asked himself a similar question as he drove back down the hill at full speed after the soldiers threatened to shoot him if he came any farther.
Kolesnik wanted to see what was wrong with the power line near the television tower that appeared to have been damaged during the fighting two days earlier, cutting off power supplies to at least three suburbs.
"I explained to them my mission and the plight of the residents sitting without electricity in such hot weather, but they wouldn\'t listen!
Fighting in Slovyansk had killed more than a dozen people and injured scores more in recent days.
But outside Slovyansk, troops from the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, army and national guard were tightening a noose around the town, manning checkpoints on every road going in and out of the city, searching vehicles and demanding to see the papers of every driver and passenger.
The blockade will continue to prevent the rebels from sneaking out of Slovyansk or getting reinforcements and weapons supplies, an Interior Ministry troops unit commander said.

Jake Betts looked every bit a cowboy as he tugged the reins of a horse named Leroy and rode up a ridge.
Meet the modern-day cowboys and cowgirls: Betts and 10 others who saddled up and began this roundup at the first break of light.
Holton Nelson, 15, has been helping drive cattle since he was 4.
They wear long sleeves even in the heat, pointed boots rather than sneakers or work shoes, and jeans of no other color than blue.
They work on the distant horizons in areas so remote that few human eyes ever view them.
Jade Cole, 16, rose at 3:30 a.m. to meet her uncle Cliff Cole, the operations manager, at the edge of a dark dirt road.
Other cowboys arrive for the roundup, their pickups hauling trailers carrying horses.
Each cowboy has his own command to get wandering cattle to join the parade, and all of the cattle obey.
"Ryan\'s a yelper," Betts acknowledges.
More than 70 cows ascend a ramp and pound into the trailer.
The cowboys will haul the cows 50 miles to a Kansas feedlot, then head back for more.
"I\'m 51 and been doing this since I was 18," he says.
"We don\'t like to go to town more than we have to," said Cliff Cole, 54.
"You have to get them to know who you are," Shane Nelson said.
Jake Betts looked every bit a cowboy as he tugged the reins of a horse named Leroy and rode up a ridge.

When the PDAs beeped, subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire about what they were doing and how they felt about it.
By gathering empirical data about real-life situations, Goetz\'s team hoped to validate psychological models that divided boredom into four distinct categories: \u2014 Indifferent boredom, a relaxing and slightly positive type of boredom that "reflected a general indifference to, and withdrawal from, the external world"; \u2014 Calibrating boredom, the slightly unpleasant state of having wandering thoughts and "a general openness to behaviors aimed at changing the situation"; \u2014 Searching boredom, the kind that makes you feel restless and leaves you "actively seeking out specific ways of minimizing feelings of boredom"; and \u2014 Reactant boredom, which is so bad that it prompts sufferers "to leave the boredom-inducing situation and avoid those responsible for this situation (e.g., teachers)."
If they reported feelings of boredom, they were asked to describe those feelings using a five-point scale that ranged from "calm" to "fidgety."
What they found is that the life of a German student can be very boring indeed.
The researchers speculated that the difference was explained by the fact that college students had more freedom to walk away from a boring situation.
Apathetic boredom accounted for 10 percent of all boredom among the college students and 36 percent of all boredom among the high-schoolers.
Students experienced apathetic boredom with even stronger feelings of aversion than they did with reactant boredom, but they were far less likely to do anything about it.
Boredom is a lot more interesting than scientists had thought.
What they found is that the life of a German student can be very boring indeed.
It can be dangerous, either for the person who is bored or for the people around him or her.
Kids who are bored are more likely to drop out of school and get into trouble with the law.
What researchers found is that the life of a German student can be very boring indeed.
During the two-week period of the study, the college students were bored 28 percent of the time.
The newly discovered type is called "apathetic boredom."
Kids who are bored are more likely to drop out of school and get into trouble with the law.
A new study of students in Germany reveals that there are five different types of boredom.
Kids who are bored are more likely to drop out of school and get into trouble with the police.
These beeped six times during the day.
College students reported that slightly more than half of their boring experiences occurred during a serious activity.
For high school students, this number was higher: two-thirds of their boring experiences occurred while they were in class or studying.
One-tenth of all boredom reported by the college students was apathetic boredom.
Among high-schoolers, more than a third of all boredom was apathetic boredom.
In other words, apathetic boredom can lead to or add to feelings of sadness and hopelessness.
They plan to study younger students, as well as adults in the workplace.
Heading north, near road marker 25 here, the speed limit shifts from 75 to 80 miles per hour (mph) \u2014 all the way north to Provo, 250 miles distant.
But many safety officials are scratching their heads over a perilous trend they say will lead to more \u2014 and more ghastly \u2014 fatalities.
But in the West, officials have kicked things up a notch: This year, Idaho and Wyoming raised their top speeds to 80 mph on some stretches of interstate.
"When your neighbor increases its speed to 80, there\'s pressure to do the same," said Kara Macek, spokeswoman for the Governors Highway Safety Association in Washington, D.C. "Motorists are giving in to the need to get everywhere quickly \u2014 especially out West, where it takes forever to get places.
Utah officials say that since 2008, highway crashes have dropped annually on stretches of rural Interstate 15 where they bumped the limit to 80.
Said Rader: "About 10,000 Americans die every year in crashes that are related to speed, from going faster than the posted limit or faster than conditions allow.
The 80 mph speed limit is symbolic of my individuality and freedom," wrote editorial page editor Robert Ehlert in the Idaho Statesman.
"You get there faster, you unload faster."
"Our guys are out there on the road every day," said Sean McNally, a spokesman for the American Trucking Association.
"Higher speed limits get people to their destinations faster, but there\'s always a cost: Ultimately, there will be more severe crashes and more deaths on those roads.
"It does make a difference \u2014 I can get ahead of schedule," said the 26-year-old, who was hauling a load of steel beams for an apartment building in Salt Lake City.

This year, Idaho and Wyoming raised their top speeds to 80 on some stretches of interstate.
Still, state officials say they are not encouraging people to go faster \u2014 just changing the limits to reflect the speeds people already drive.
Utah officials say that highway crashes have dropped on parts of rural Interstate 15 where they raised the speed limit to 80.
A 2009 study also suggested that more drivers in Utah were following the new limit.
National safety experts have criticized raising limits on roads shared by pedestrians, bicyclists and public transportation.
Outside Leeds, at a gas station popular with travelers, long-distance truck driver Jake Hansen stopped for coffee and a bathroom break.
"It does make a difference \u2014 I can get ahead of schedule," said the 26-year-old Hansen, who was hauling a load of steel beams for an apartment building in Salt Lake City.
"The 80 mph speed limit is symbolic of my individuality and freedom," editorial page editor Robert Ehlert wrote in the Idaho Statesman.
This small town along Interstate 15 is just a blur for most drivers zooming through.
The limit stays at 80 mph for 250 more miles.
"Higher speed limits get people to their destinations faster, but there\'s always a cost: Ultimately, there will be more severe crashes and more deaths on those roads."
Thirteen states have increased speed limits since 2005.
They include Georgia, Illinois, Maine, New Hampshire, Kentucky and Ohio.
Most of those have set the highest limits at 70 or 75 mph.
"When your neighbor increases its speed to 80, there\'s pressure to do the same," said Kara Macek of the Governors Highway Safety Association.

Speed limits are moving higher all over the country, especially in wide-open Western states like Utah and Montana.
Most of these have set the highest limits at 70 or 75 mph.
Utah highway official John Gleason said the higher limits help traffic run more smoothly.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140501_MINECRAFT.png" />CHICAGO \u2014 Seventh-graders at Northbrook\'s Maple School had just started learning about the Cold War when a handful of boys sat down at the school\'s library computers to cement their understanding of the subject.
They were building a model of divided Germany with the help of one of the world\'s hottest video games: "Minecraft."
"It\'s really a great visual tool for presenting our knowledge, just like you would use something like PowerPoint to show off your research," said Arie Estrin, 12, who was assembling a nuclear submarine, block by digital block.
"It\'s virtual Legos," said Zack Gilbert, a sixth-grade teacher in Normal, Ill., who hosts a podcast on gaming in education.
"That\'s what this is, except it\'s virtual and there\'s more building and creating than you could ever do (in the real world)."
Joel Levin, a former teacher who helped create a version of the game for educators, said his young daughter picked up sophisticated math skills such as estimation and proportion merely by building a "Minecraft" house.
"\'Minecraft\' is offering teachers a new type of learning experience, but the secret sauce is that kids are engaged," said Levin, whose company, TeacherGaming, has sold the "MinecraftEdu" version of the game to 2,500 schools worldwide.
Some kids want to do it so much that they sign up for weekend or summer classes that use "Minecraft" as a teaching tool.

Barrett began teaching the class in 1990 shortly after the school opened.
She keeps each student for three years in her classroom, allowing her to get to know them more personally.
A teacher not using grades might rely on observation and detailed "running records" about students instead.
Fischetti said research shows students in ungraded classes are not worse off, but for such a class to work, teachers have to be well-prepared.
Her students enter the class at or above grade level and finish second grade capable of reading fourth-grade-level books, she said.
Barrett will be retiring this year after 36 years of teaching, but another teacher at the school will be taking the helm of her class.
Her students enter the class at or above grade level and finish second grade capable of reading fourth-grade-level books, she said.
Once a week she issues a graded spelling assignment.
"All that tells you is a number.
"I take a good, hard look at sometimes how they\'re working and watch them as they\'re doing math, watch them as they\'re reading," she said.
The standards set what each grade is supposed to know and understand, and requires a lot of testing to make sure students are learning what they are supposed to.
Letter or number grades make it easy for teachers to see which students understand a lesson, Stone said.
She still teaches the educational standards, which are required by the state, and gives state-mandated tests.
Once a week, she assigns a graded spelling assignment and even rates students "satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory" depending on how hard they try.
Barrett said that because she keeps students for longer, older students already know her classroom and show the younger students how to behave.
There is no pressure to earn an A or fear of receiving an F. Barrett has taught at Seminole Springs Elementary School in Eustis, Fla., for nearly 25 years.
During that time, she has never given out letter grades.
The no-grades approach became popular with school systems in the 1990s, said Sandra J.
Stone said they perform as well or better.
She also gives all the tests required by the state.

"For the first time in history, states recommended by consensus that an international treaty be negotiated to address the urgent crisis of biodiversity loss on the high seas," says Daniela Diz, a marine policy expert at WWF (World Wildlife Fund), who sat in on the consultations, "It\'s an important step forward."
Although not utterly lawless, high seas management is a jumble of institutions and regulations.
"The new agreement will be about what we keep in the seas, instead of what we extract," says Karen Sack, director of The Pew Charitable Trusts\' International Marine Program, who has been involved in these discussions since the beginning in 2004.
In terms of overfishing the agreement would, among other things, make it much easier to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in international waters.
And yet, the evidence in favor of closing the high seas to fishing is mounting.
"I realize what we have lost," says Enric Sala, a National Geographic Society explorer-in-residence and co-author of the UBC paper, who dives in some of world\'s least-touched waters.
"It\'s the difference between the places that are degraded and places that are pristine and beautiful that gives us hope."

The nets destroy everything in their path, including the fragile marine ecosystems, such as the deepwater corals and sponges that give shelter to fish.
To prevent overfishing the agreement would, among other things, make it much easier to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the high seas.
Should these rules not be put into effect within five years, the commission suggests closing the high seas to fishing.
Many of them are suffering economically, particularly in West Africa, because too many fish are being killed off by high-seas fishing fleets.
If the agreement is successfully negotiated, there may be no need for closing down the high seas to fisheries.
The nets destroy everything in their path, including the fragile marine ecosystems, such as the deepwater corals and sponges that give shelter to fish.
Environmentalists celebrated last month after the United Nations finally agreed that the high seas need protection.
Its rich marine life, though, is dying off.
Most of the deep-sea fishing in the high seas is done by bottom trawling, in which heavy nets are scraped across the seafloor.
In contrast, just about 1 percent of the high seas is protected.
"The new agreement will be about what we keep in the seas, instead of what we extract," says Karen Sack.
An uncoordinated jumble of institutions and regulations have control over different aspects of the high seas.

More than 20,000 U.S. farms employ more than 435,000 immigrant workers legally every year, according to 2012 U.S. Department of Agriculture census data.
"Because we\'re not a border state, it\'s definitely harder to get people over this far from the border to work," said Chalmers Carr, the owner of the East Coast\'s largest peach grower, South Carolina\'s Titan Farms.
"In northern Ohio, we\'re on the front lines, and it\'s not because we\'re on the northern border," said Mark Gilson, the owner and operator of Gilson Gardens, a nursery in northeastern Ohio, which relies largely on seasonal immigrant workers.
You\'ve got a choice to import your food or you can import your labor to harvest your food," Carr said.
"These aren\'t just people with their heads down in the field for us.
"There\'s truly not enough farmworkers now, legal or illegal."
Farmers say the crops and the growing season cannot wait.
"We\'re losing that aging population, but we\'re also not getting anybody replacing them because of the mess we have at the border and no immigration law," said Manuel Cunha Jr.
From 2010 to 2012, Carr said, he advertised for 2,000 workers.
"We respect their hard work, and we share traditional American values with them."
Some who oppose changing the laws say U.S. workers should fill those jobs.
The second team found many other species have only one copy, just like humans.
Schiffman and his colleagues compared how elephant cells reacted to radiation, compared with cells from 10 healthy humans and 10 patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
While the research won\'t lead to any immediate treatment for humans, progress against cancer can come "from unexpected directions," said Dr. Ted Gansler of the American Cancer Society.
The elephant cells self-destructed at twice the rate of healthy human cells and more than five times the rate of cells from patients with the syndrome.
While studies in humans are at least several years away, "we certainly think we\'ve found something very intriguing," Schiffman said.
If they are right, their discovery might someday lead to new ways to protect people from cancer.

When the iPad was announced, Hockney said he had one shipped immediately to his home in London, where he splits his time with Los Angeles.
And Hatch said there are some drawbacks to the shift to tablet art.
When asked where he sees the world of art going, he shrugged his broad shoulders and paused.
It includes many of his iPad images.
In one picture, scrubby, bright green pines sparkle in sunlight.
Some of the iPad drawings are displayed on digital screens.
Others, like the Yosemite works, were printed on six large panels.
But there are some drawbacks to the shift to tablet art, Hatch added.
On a summer day in 1885, three Hawaiian princes surfed at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on crudely constructed boards made from coastal redwoods, bringing the sport to the North American mainland.
"It definitely worries me," said big-wave rider Jake Wormhoudt, who has already noticed changes in water temperature, weather and sand deposition throughout the 35 years he has surfed in Santa Cruz.
By 2100, these storms could shift, sending their swells on a course parallel to the coast rather than toward it.
"As we increase sea level \u2026 those same size waves won\'t break over those nice bedrock ridges in the same spots that they used to," said Curt Storlazzi, a research geologist and oceanographer, also with the USGS office in Santa Cruz.
Some Monterey Bay communities have erected barriers to protect homes and infrastructure from rising seas.
These barriers may also contribute to beach erosion, cutting off access to surfing spots.
That could improve surf conditions to the Monterey Bay, at least temporarily.
If the predictions come true and the Monterey Bay closes the 21st century with poor surfing waves, scientists say the shifting climate and rising seas could create better surfing conditions along other seawall-free stretches of the California coastline \u2014 but there are too many variables to pinpoint where.
This mixed and uncertain future may leave some surfers and their supporters grasping for certainty.

On a summer day in 1885, three Hawaiian princes surfed at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on crudely constructed boards made from coastal redwoods, bringing the sport to the North American mainland.
"Well, I thought so, too," Erikson said with a laugh.

Modern surfers wear wet suits to stay warm and check satellite weather forecasts on their smartphones before heading to legendary surf spots such as Steamer Lane and Pleasure Point in Santa Cruz.
"It definitely worries me," said big-wave rider Jake Wormhoudt, who has already noticed changes in water temperature and weather patterns during the 35 years he has surfed in Santa Cruz.
Recently, researchers began to use the models to study how a warming world might affect waves, said Li Erikson, a coastal engineer with the U.S. Geological Survey in Santa Cruz.
"We\'ll roll with it," mused Pete Ogilvie, a Monterey Bay surfer for more than three decades.
He is facing the seemingly unavoidable change with a laid-back Surf City vibe.
Higher sea levels will change when, where and how waves break against the coast.
"If there\'s a 3-foot tide, everyone\'s out here," he said recently as he headed out to surf Steamer Lane.
If the predictions are true, Monterey Bay could close the 21st century with poor surfing waves.
This mixed and uncertain future may leave some surfers grasping for hard answers.

The waves that surfers ride in California often start out in the open ocean.
Mother Teresa, the tiny, stooped nun who cared for the poorest of the poor in the slums of India and beyond, will be declared a saint next year after Pope Francis approved a miracle attributed to her intercession.
"With her work, she was always the symbol of mercy, not just with words but with her actions," said the superior general of Mother Teresa\'s Missionaries of Charity, the Rev.
By Dec. 9, 2008, he was in a coma and dying, suffering from an accumulation of fluid around the brain.
The surgery did not take place and a day later the man was declared to be symptom-free.
We are very happy," said Sunita Kumar, a spokeswoman for the Missionaries of Charity in the eastern city of Kolkata (earlier called Calcutta), where Mother Teresa lived and worked.
The order was established four years later and has since opened more than 130 houses worldwide to provide comfort and care for the needy, sick and "poorest of the poor."
At the time, her Missionaries of Charity order had nearly 4,000 nuns and ran roughly 600 orphanages, soup kitchens, homeless shelters and clinics around the world.
During his September 2014 visit to Albania, Francis confided to his interpreter that he was not only impressed by her fortitude, but in some ways feared it.
But Bergoglio, who has long shown admiration for the women who raised him and taught him, added: "I would have been afraid to have had her as my superior, since she was so tough."
During his quarter-century papacy, John Paul declared more saints \u2014 482 \u2014 than all of his predecessors combined.

Prince William Sound today looks spectacular, a stunning landscape of mountainous fjords \u2014 blue-green waters framed by cliffs, and thickly forested islands.
"I think the big surprise for all of us who have worked on this thing for the last 25 years has been the continued presence of relatively fresh oil," said Gary Shigenaka, a marine biologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Listed as still not recovering are the herring, a group of killer whales and the pigeon guillemots, a North Pacific seabird.
Exxon checks to pay people for their losses were too late and too little, he said.
It was rough," said Wills, who now runs a bookshop and cafe in Homer, Alaska.
Prince William Sound was home to a flourishing spring herring fishery.
Researchers found growths and other physical abnormalities in herring exposed to the oil.
"No other (fish) stock in Alaska crashed in 1993, so that\'s indirect evidence it is spill-related," said Jeep Rice, who studied the spill for more than two decades as a federal scientist.
The herring never really recovered, and the current population is too low to overcome predators.
"The evidence is pretty compelling that it was a spill-related effect on those two groups of killer whales," said federal marine biologist Shigenaka.
Scientists now expect it to go extinct, the end of a genetic line that researchers say has hunted in the area for thousands of years, maybe since the last ice age.
"The sound is thriving environmentally and we\'ve had a very solid, complete recovery," said Richard Keil, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil.
Wills, who fished salmon as well as herring, said the spill left a huge mark on those who made a living from Prince William Sound.
Then, four years after the spill, the herring population crashed dramatically.
The killer whales of Prince William Sound also have suffered.
A Los Angeles Times photo showed whales from the other group swimming near the tanker as it gushed oil.
Populations dropped dramatically in the year after the spill.
But, the checks were too late and too little, he said.
Court cases will decide whether to seek more money from Exxon Mobil for cleaning up the remaining oil.
David Fiori, waist-deep in the chilly Kern River, braced against the current, stabbed a shovel into the ancient silt between his feet and tossed the muck downstream.
California is in the third year of severe drought, and 2013 was the driest on record \u2014 the driest since the 1500s, according to one study.
But for one small, proud, iconoclastic community \u2014 gold prospectors \u2014 the drought has been a boon.

Researchers at a New York City hospital several years ago conducted a test of the widely accepted notion that skipping breakfast can make you fat.
Indeed, it is enshrined in the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, the federal government\'s advice book, which recommends having breakfast every day because "not eating breakfast has been associated with excess body weight."
And the only group to lose weight was ... the group that skipped breakfast.
"In overweight individuals, skipping breakfast daily for 4 weeks leads to a reduction in body weight," the researchers from Columbia University concluded in a paper published last year.
A closer look at the way that government nutritionists adopted the breakfast warning for the Dietary Guidelines shows how loose scientific guesses \u2014 possibly right, possibly wrong \u2014 can be elevated into hard-and-fast federal nutrition rules that are broadcast throughout the United States.
In analyzing the results of observational studies, scientists make statistical adjustments to account for the potential confounding factors they can measure \u2014 age, alcohol consumption, exercise, employment, and the like.

One of the key pieces of evidence, for example, examined the records for 20,000 male health professionals.
Breakfast skippers in the health professionals study, for example, tended to drink more, smoke more and exercise less.

Students, parents and teachers have complained about the number of hours that kids spend taking standardized tests, especially since the introduction of the Common Core academic standards.
But just how much time each year is it?
The correct answer is "B," according to a comprehensive study of 66 of the nation\'s big-city school districts by the Council of the Great City Schools.
The president went on to say that federal officials would work with states, schools and teachers to "make sure that we\'re not obsessing about testing."
About 12 million students in 29 states and the District of Columbia took the new tests.
Also, 4 in 10 districts reported having to wait between two and four months before getting state test results.
The lack of timely results meant that teachers began the new school year without knowing if a student was having a problem.

"The Army goes to such an expense to make rations, then watches time and time again as soldiers throw out anything that doesn\'t look and taste good," said Mary Ann Lila, director of N.C. State\'s Plants for Human Health Institute in Kannapolis.
To make their products, Lila and research partners at Rutgers University have found a way to extract the fruit and vegetable phytochemicals and bind them with flour made from soybeans or hemp.
Meanwhile, researchers at the Plants for Human Health Institute are experimenting with various foods that could be made with the infused flour and testing them for shelf-life, nutrition and taste value.
Athletes, outdoor enthusiasts and people trying to control their weight could also benefit.
These and other vegetables and fruits naturally contain phytochemicals.
Soldiers on duty  in harsh climates such as Iraq or Africa have the fewest options.

"Intifada" is an Arabic word roughly translated as "uprising" or "rebellion."
A year ago, U.S.-led peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians broke down, and seem unlikely to restart anytime soon.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict goes back to 1947.
Today, many Palestinians live in two areas that Israel partly controls: the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
In the FIFA complaint, the Palestinians said that Israeli restrictions on their movement and military action in the West Bank have prevented their teams from playing soccer.
They also charged that the Israeli Football Association has not done enough to fight anti-Arab racism inside Israeli soccer stadiums.
Blatter declined to give details about his meeting with Netanyahu.
He did say he would pass along a message from the Israeli prime minister to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, whom he has to meet in Ramallah in the West Bank on Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Palestinian Football Association chief Jibril Rajoub said he had no plans to back down from the resolution.
Rajoub said he believed he would be able to secure enough votes from FIFA members to pass the resolution.

The Palestinians and the Israelis have been fighting over land since 1947.
A year ago, the Palestinians and Israelis were in peace talks led by the United States.
The Palestinian-Israeli conflict goes back to 1947.
The creation of Israel was disputed: Palestinians claimed the land belonged to them.
The Palestinians also say that Israel has not controlled racism against Arabs inside Israeli soccer stadiums.
Blatter was scheduled to meet with Abbas in the West Bank on Wednesday.
The Palestinians were mixing politics and soccer, Kemer said.
No presidential library has been built in a low-income, inner-city neighborhood.
Developer Dan McCaffery wants the library amid his developments in southeastern Chicago.
Rutherford was among those who visited each site, looking at access, parking, cost of rehabbing the land, and proximity to hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions.
Marshall Brown, an assistant professor of architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology, said location is important because presidential libraries have only a limited ability to attract large numbers of people on their own.
Washington Park residents are hoping that President Barack Obama will choose to build his presidential library in their neighborhood.
The Clinton library in Little Rock, Ark., sparked more than $2 billion in development along the downtown riverfront since the library was announced in 1994.
The decision will be announced in early 2015.
They wouldn\'t have to wait on school trips, with something as fantastic as a presidential library just down the street or around the corner from where they live," she said.
The Clinton library in Little Rock, Ark., led to more than $2 billion in development along the downtown riverfront since the library was announced in 1994.
The area known as the River Market District averages more than 300,000 visitors a year.
They wouldn\'t have to wait on school trips, with something as fantastic as a presidential library just down the street or around the corner from where they live," she said.
"You have to make sure you don\'t damage the library as a whole and end up not helping anyone," Smith said.
He also asked them to design their own ambitious plans for the campus.
"The (Kennedy) library, which has been sitting on Columbia Point in Boston since the 1980s, has attracted very little energy," Brown said.
They are hoping that President Barack Obama will choose to build his presidential library in their area.
Obama was born in Hawaii, but many believe that he will choose to build his library in Chicago.
"Kids could just be passing by and stop in," she said.
"They wouldn\'t have to wait on school trips, with a presidential library just down the street from where they live," she said.
"There could be a risk of crime, poverty or reputation," said Curt Smith, author of a book on presidential libraries.
The area known as the River Market District now attracts more than 300,000 visitors a year.
Brown had his graduate students examine the possible sites for the library in Chicago.
Currie, 51, has been fascinated with crossbreeding plants since he was a boy in Michigan.
He read library books about plants and pored over horticulture magazines ordered by his mother, a master gardener.
It took 12 years of crossbreeding for Currie to reach the pinnacle of the pepper world.
The peppers are shapely and alluring: orange, red and green spheres glowing in the late autumn sunshine.
Currie is a natural contrarian who insists on doing things his peculiar way, so it took him more than two years to fill out Guinness paperwork.
The human body responds to the chemical "heat" from the Reaper as if it were burned with a match, he said.
The hottest hybrid \u2014 the name is top secret \u2014 "tastes awful," Currie said.
Forty minutes after chewing one, he was still gulping water, he said.
He began crossbreeding peppers after reading scientific papers suggesting that their chemical compounds might reduce the risk of heart attacks and cancer, two diseases that run in his family, Currie said.
At home, he made salsas and hot sauces from peppers he grew in his yard.
That helped Currie woo and wed his wife, who loves salsa.
Two years ago, he opened a storefront location on Main Street in downtown Fort Mill.
It took 12 years of crossbreeding for Currie to reach the pinnacle of the pepper world.
Finally, Currie submitted 15 pages of scientific documentation, based on years of Reaper testing by chemists at Winthrop University in South Carolina.
In fact, he said, just the Reaper fumes and residue on his lab gloves were too hot for him.
Currie grows more than 15,000 chili pepper plants at 30 sites in North and South Carolina, plus sites in four other states, and at his home.
He read library books about plants and pored over horticulture magazines ordered by his mother, a master gardener.
The 8-year-old company sells salsa, hot sauce, chili seeds, chili jellies, chocolates, peanut brittle and brownies to customers worldwide.
He read library books about plants and pored over horticulture magazines ordered by his mother, a master gardener.
"It has a few seconds of flavor, and then the heat builds and builds and just doesn\'t let up."
Chili heat rankings may seem trivial, but they are a burning issue for people who sell hot sauce, salsa and other spicy things.
The peppers helped him woo and wed his wife, who loves salsa.
She helped convince him later to sell his salsas rather than giving them away to friends and neighbors.
It took Currie 12 years of crossbreeding to reach the peak of the pepper world.
He said he tested hundreds of hybrid combinations before finally finding the perfect combination.
In the end, he combined a "really nastily hot" La Soufriere pepper from the Caribbean island of St. Vincent and a Naga pepper from Pakistan to create Smokin\' Ed\'s Carolina Reaper \u2014 called "a tidal wave of scorching fire" on the company\'s website.
In his fourth year of the breeding the Reaper \u2014 it takes years for hybrids to reproduce and stabilize \u2014 Currie asked a friend to taste the new hybrid.
Finally, Currie submitted 15 pages of scientific documentation, based on years of testing by chemists at Winthrop University in South Carolina.
Their official rating of the Reaper \u2014 1.56 million Scoville heat units \u2014 was accepted by Guinness.
He woke up hours later at 2 a.m. "with an awful gut ball" \u2014 terrible stomach cramps.
He choked down the rest of the Reaper and gulped down cold carbonated water.
He read library books about plants and read horticulture magazines ordered by his mother, a master gardener.

As U.S. military forces have engaged in more than a decade of war across the Middle East, America has found an unwavering partner in Canada, a country with an otherwise peaceful image.
"Canadians will not be intimidated.
We will be prudent, but we will not panic."
Bob Paulson, commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, described Zehaf-Bibeau as a 32-year-old Canadian who may also have held Libyan citizenship.
He seized one of the vehicles, which he used to drive to Center Block, the main Parliament building, where lawmakers were holding caucus meetings.
Police gave chase by car and were seconds behind Zehaf-Bibeau when he ran through the main doors, Paulson said.
Security has been heightened at military bases and government buildings throughout Canada.

Eyeing the end of his presidency, Barack Obama urged Americans Tuesday night to rekindle their belief in the promise of change that first carried him to the White House, declaring that the country must not allow election-year fear and division to put economic and security progress at risk.
"The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.
"No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome," Haley said in excerpts released ahead of her remarks.
He touted implementation of the landmark nuclear deal with Iran, but made no mention of the 10 American sailors picked up by Iran Tuesday.
"The rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better," he conceded.
He also urged steps to make voting easier and reduce the influence of money in politics.

President Barack Obama addressed the nation on Tuesday, encouraging Americans to rekindle their belief in change.
He hoped to use his speech to both shape how he will be remembered as president, and influence voters.
He said there were voices urging Americans to not trust "fellow citizens who don\'t look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background."
He discussed how he created jobs and helped businesses after the 2007 financial crisis.
The bitterness between the parties has gotten worse, he admitted.
It was his slogan when he ran for president eight years ago.
Obama also warned against dangerous voices.
Obama also wanted the nation to look back at all he had done in office.
The two parties are the Democrats and the Republicans.
Obama did not mention the names of candidates, or individuals who are trying to become president.

The New Haven Promise is no one-way street.
During the few years these Promise programs have been in place, it has has become clear that providing free tuition is not enough.
The Promise program will be considered a success if students are able to do well enough in college to finish with a 2-year or 4-year degree.
In New Haven, it may be too soon to tell, but the hope is that the new culture of success will make the difference in the years to come.
Imagine a city where one-third of the children live in poverty and one-tenth of the adults cannot find a job.
Imagine a place where barely six of 10 students even finish high school.
Students must also complete 40 hours of community service at a community organization.

High schools are now providing college readiness courses for their students.
Imagine a city where one-third of the children live in poverty and one-tenth of the adults cannot find a job.
That city was New Haven, Connecticut, just a few years ago.
The program, New Haven Promise, would pay for the college tuition of high school graduates who qualify.
New Haven Promise will cover full tuition to Connecticut public universities and part of the tuition for private universities in Connecticut.
The city had factories that employed low-skilled workers, but those factories are long gone.
During the few years these Promise programs have been in place, it has become clear that just providing free tuition is not enough.
There may be nobody setting an example of success or encouraging them to work hard.
In addition to Promise, New Haven started another program called College Summit.
The goal is to create a culture of success from kindergarten all the way through 12th grade.
But educators are finding that many Promise scholarship students are not able to finish the first year of college.
Others are not able to get high enough grades to keep their scholarship.
For example, in Kalamazoo, where Promise started, middle-income students were about twice as successful as poor students.
The city is finding ways to give students help and guidance all the way through college.
To earn the scholarship, they must live in New Haven and attend New Haven public schools.

A youth movement, known as Rebel, has collected more than 22 million signatures on petitions calling for Morsi to step aside for early elections.
The president and the Brotherhood have refused to budge and the military has deployed troops around government buildings and along the shipping lanes of the Suez Canal.
Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the defense minister, has so far sided with the president and has not signaled a military takeover.
But Sisi has said he will not allow the country to veer into a "dark tunnel" of political collapse and economic turmoil.
Now we have power cuts, no fuel, and everything\'s going bad," said Mohammad Khaled, a 19-year-old electrician who stood in Cairo\'s Tahrir Square beneath a clear sky.

Boys also saw problems in football which, unlike the others, is a contact sport.
Locally, doctors see injuries arising from all of these sports, along with cheerleading and dance.
Athletes who had an ACL injury are 10 times more likely to have early-onset degenerative knee osteoarthritis than those who never had an ACL injury.
Kids should have days off and should be doing different activities \u2014 if a child is doing the same sport all year, she is overusing some muscles and not strengthening others.
Be careful of your knees, girls.
In the meantime, put ice on it and use crutches to try to stay off it, Schultz says.
The risk goes up for girls once they hit age 12 or 13 and for boys around age 14 or 15.
"I have daughters that play sports \u2014 I\'m worried about it," Schultz says.
So, what does all this research mean for parents, and for their daughters (and sons)?
It found that girls are 2.5 to 6.2 times more likely to have an ACL injury.
Usually, you feel a pop in the knee and then see swelling, says Randall Schultz, a doctor who works on bones and joints.
Sports where kids stop suddenly and turn a different direction usually are the cause.
Boys also saw problems with football which, unlike the others, is a contact sport.
The number of athletic kids with ACL injuries is on the rise because of a change in how they play sports: More kids these days are focusing on one sport intensely all year, with few breaks.
It found that around half were never able to play as well as they had before their injury.
Parents also should get realistic about how much sports their kids are doing.
Three Rivers is literally crawling with hungry bears driven down from the mountains by drought in search of food to fatten up for winter.

At 8:52 in the evening, the New Horizons control center in Maryland received radio confirmation from the most distant reaches of our solar system.
Scientists at the control center at the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University in Maryland have examined the last image the spacecraft sent before going into radio silence.
The two sides of the heart have two distinct colors which indicates different chemical compositions.
Images from the spacecraft also confirm the difference between the varied and active surface of Pluto and the darker, grayer, cratered terrain of its largest moon Charon.
For example, it is much redder than Triton, so much so that its surface evokes that of Mars.
These surfaces presumably take their color from hydrocarbons that have been baked by solar radiation, creating dark tars known as "tholins."
At 8:52 in the evening, the New Horizons control center in Maryland received radio confirmation from the most distant reaches of our solar system.
It shows the hemisphere of Pluto that faces away from its main moon, Charon.
"These images show a much younger surface on Pluto and an older, more battered surface on Charon."
Pluto appears to have craters that have been filled in and are now smooth areas.

Jean-Marie Chauvet noticed air whistling out from a crack on a plateau in southern France, so he and fellow cave enthusiasts went to investigate.
"What impressed us," Chauvet said, "was the freshness.
Since then, scientists have determined that cave drawings in El Castillo in Spain were painted at least 40,000 years ago.
Officials with the Culture Ministry were convicted of falsifying documents to make it look like he was on official duty when he found it; he insists he was on holiday at the time.
But a similar replica \u2014 of the 18,000-year-old cave drawings in the Lascaux caves in southwest France \u2014 draws about 300,000 visitors yearly.
The next step, Terrasse said, could be "a virtual version, 3-D, something that could move around" \u2014 and bring prehistory to generations looking to the future.
Jean-Marie Chauvet noticed air whistling out from a crack on a plateau in southern France, so he and fellow cave enthusiasts went to investigate.
The discovery of the long-hidden artwork created a sensation, but the site was quickly closed to the public.

In 1994, Jean-Marie Chauvet noticed air whistling out from a crack in the rock in southern France, so he and other explorers went to investigate.
The paintings were so vivid, he says, it felt like the Stone Age artists had just moments ago put down their red ochre paint and walked away.
It turned out that the cave paintings had been remarkably well-preserved thanks to a rock fall about 23,000 years ago that concealed the entrance.
At the time of their discovery, they were the oldest known human cave drawings.
"We understood that we had to quickly protect it, and ensure that it was never opened to the public" to protect it from visitors, he said.

DARE, based at the University of Wisconsin, finally reached the final volume including "Z" in 2012.
Discovering such words and preserving them may seem a whimsical pursuit, but it has practical applications.
A couple of months ago, Douglas Kelling, a 68-year-old internist in Concord, North Carolina, was examining an 80-year-old woman when the patient turned to him and said: "Doc, how\'s my ticklebox?"
For years, DARE has weathered seemingly endless financial crises, somehow always finding eleventh-hour benefactors.
And the university has troubles of its own: a proposed two-year, $300 million budget cut from the governor.
If she is unable to find more funding, Hall said she may stay on at 20 percent of her salary and spend the next year, "trying to figure out what goes in the archives and what goes elsewhere."
DARE has information about all of the other languages that have contributed to English.
Planned in 1963 by its first editor, Frederic Gomes Cassidy, the project stretched far beyond its first deadline of 1976.

A couple of months ago, Douglas Kelling, a 68-year-old internist in Concord, North Carolina, was examining an 80-year-old woman when the patient turned to him and said: "Doc, how\'s my ticklebox?"
The baffled doctor asked what she meant by "ticklebox."
Chief Editor Joan Houston Hall, who has devoted almost 40 years to the project, recently sent layoff and nonrenewal notices to all four DARE staff members.
Hall scans the digital version of DARE, looking up the word bittern, a marsh bird, and marveling at more than 50 regional alternatives, including belcher-squelcher, dunkadoo, conk-onk, fly-up-the-creek and wollerkertoot.
Associate Editor George Goebel traced the word back to the middle of the 19th century and discovered it was not a term for a species of fish back then, but rather for the process of lightly salting and grilling a fish.
Many of the entries are still kept on the original paper slips collected in the 1960s by DARE field workers as they crisscrossed the country in "word wagons," interviewing sources.
The end may be near for the half-century-old Dictionary of American Regional English.

Without more money for the dictionary, she also will lose her full-time job.
The dictionary is often referred to by its acronym DARE.
In almost 40 years of practice, the doctor has heard patients use many regional terms for illnesses.
Kelling believes the dictionary is valuable in helping him understand his patients better.
Without more money for the dictionary, she also will lose her full-time job.
The Irish brought the word brogan, which is a heavy work shoe; the Italians brought vino, a term for wine; the Germans gave us hausfrau for housewife; and the Polish brought over paczki, a filled doughnut.
This time, though, the project will begin its year with less than $100,000.

Whether belting out lyrics to Al Green\'s "Let\'s Stay Together," leading a mournful congregation through "Amazing Grace," or tweeting his Spotify music playlist that includes Stevie Wonder and Nina Simone, President Barack Obama has shown that he\'s a pretty soulful guy.
The Grammy Award-winning jazz singer and bassist said the variety of musicians who have performed at the White House conveys a message of inclusion at what the Obamas have long touted as the "People\'s House."
"It seems like there is a theme of wanting to really support artists who are working hard \u2014 not just in their craft \u2014 but communicating about the issues of our time," said Spalding, an advocate of human rights issues at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Spalding, who has trained student musicians at a White House workshop, said the Obamas believe that "just because you\'re not famous, doesn\'t mean you\'re not important.

Another demonstration at a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Dallas gained attention when managers asked customers to "not bring guns into our restaurants, unless they are authorized law enforcement personnel."
Since the demonstrations have begun, several fast-food outlets have asked that customers not bring long guns into their businesses.
"Using guns merely to draw attention to yourself in public not only defies common sense, it shows a lack of consideration and manners," according to the statement.

Without that, I never would have known that history of my great-great grandfather."
The obituary of his great-great grandfather, Eberhard said, allowed him to "connect some of the dots" of his family\'s history.
"There was so much information in there," he said of the obituary.
William moved from Belleville to Orange County, California.
Gaa said the German students are providing "a service to people" who can\'t read German and don\'t live locally and so can\'t read the old newspapers on microfilm at the Belleville Public Library.
The assignment to translate the obituaries is challenging for the 19 students in his fourth-year German class, according to Gaa.
They work with partners, and Gaa is available to help as well.
Knipp said it\'s "really cool" to translate the old German obituaries into English.
"I like translating this stuff, knowing it\'s going to help people."
The German students translate obituaries as an in-class assignment twice a year \u2014 one time each semester.
The most important thing about the German obituaries is they mention the particular town the immigrant came from, according to Walsh.

Nestle SA, among the biggest food companies in the world, launched the investigation in December 2014, after reports from news outlets and nongovernmental organizations tied brutal and largely unregulated working conditions to their shrimp, prawns and Purina brand pet foods.
Brokers illegally charge them fees to get jobs, trapping them into working on fishing vessels and at ports, mills and seafood farms in Thailand to pay back more money than they can ever earn.
When someone dies, he gets thrown into the water," one Burmese worker told the nonprofit organization Verite, commissioned by Nestle.
It has promised to impose new requirements on all potential suppliers and train boat owners and captains about human rights, possibly with a demonstration vessel and rewards for altering their practices.
"As we\'ve said consistently, forced labor and human rights abuses have no place in our supply chain," Magdi Batato, Nestle\'s executive vice president in charge of operations, said in a written statement.

Giant global food company Nestle SA has sold fish caught and processed by slave laborers in Thailand.
In an act of self-policing, the corporation announced the conclusions of its yearlong internal investigation last week.
Verite visited fish ports and fishmeal packing plants, shrimp farms and docked fishing boats, all in Thailand.
But the group said many of the problems they observed exist throughout the industry and are not unique to Nestle.
It is one of several lawsuits filed in recent months against major U.S. retailers importing seafood from Thailand.
Giant global food company Nestle SA has sold fish caught and processed by slave laborers in Thailand.
Some of the lawsuits refer to reports from the AP.
Verite found that just about all U.S. and European companies buying seafood from Thailand might have the same problem.
It said it would post the Verite reports online and come up with a plan to solve the problem.
All fish suppliers will have to follow strict rules on how they treat workers.
Verite found child workers who were forced to fish.
In August, pet food buyers filed a lawsuit against the company.
It claimed that fish in Fancy Feast cat food was caught and processed with slave labor in Thailand.
Major League Baseball plans to eliminate home plate collisions, possibly as soon as next season but no later than by 2015.
New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson, chairman of the rules committee, made the announcement Wednesday at the winter meetings.
"Ultimately what we want to do is change the culture of acceptance that these plays are ordinary and routine and an accepted part of the game," Alderson said.
MLB also is instituting a vast increase in the use of instant replay by umpires next season in an effort to eliminate blown calls.
Evidently the guys making all these rules never played the game of baseball."

Major League Baseball plans to eliminate home plate collisions, possibly as soon as next season but no later than by 2015.
Posey, an All-Star catcher, sustained a broken bone in his lower left leg and three torn ligaments in his ankle, an injury that ended his season.
"I don\'t think it\'s completely sparked by anything that\'s happened in baseball as much as what\'s happening outside of baseball and how it\'s impacting people and impacting the welfare of each sport," said Matheny, now managing the St. Louis Cardinals.
So, for example, intentionally running over the catcher might result in an out call.

"Ride-sharing companies will look for any opportunity to demonstrate to people that they can be an alternative for any situation that they encounter in their life, including back-to-school," said Thilo Koslowski, lead automotive industry analyst at technology research firm Gartner.

Founded in 2009, market leader Uber is valued at more than $50 billion after closing its latest round of funding, according to a report last month in the Wall Street Journal.
Uber has introduced uberFAMILY \u2014 a $10 upcharge for a car that arrives with a child\'s car seat \u2014 in New York City and Washington, D.C., and is "exploring the possibility" of launching the service in Chicago, Illinois, according to Anderson.
Several new competitors, including Shuddle and HopSkipDrive, are actively offering rides to children using a staff of mostly female drivers who double as caregivers, with safeguards aimed at getting parents over the hump of putting their kids in cars with strangers.
They feature more thorough vetting of drivers, specialized insurance, tracking apps to monitor progress and responsibilities that extend beyond transportation.
Drivers are trained and empowered to sign kids out of school and help them check in at after-school activities.
"We call them \'caredrivers\' because they are caregivers first and drivers second," said HopSkipDrive co-founder and CEO Joanna McFarland, 39, a Stanford Uiversity MBA and one of three moms who launched the service in March.
The first back-to-school season looks to be busy for both upstart services.
Jeremiah Owyang, an analyst and founder of Silicon Valley, California-based Crowd Companies, said that while there is clearly a market, limiting ride-hailing services to children may be too narrow to sustain a business model in an as-yet-unprofitable industry.
Whether the "can you pick me up" call will be fully replaced by an app remains to be seen.
"We do not allow unaccompanied minors on the Lyft platform, per our terms of service," said Katie Dally, Lyft spokeswoman.
Numerous reports indicate that the San Francisco, California-based company is bleeding red ink as it pushes to rapidly expand.

The company has raised $12 million in funding and has built a crew of 200 mostly female drivers \u2014 moms, teachers, nannies and other caregivers \u2014 to transport kids throughout the Bay Area.
"As we head back to school, we\'re seeing a lot of interest, a lot of activity."
But Allen is confident, saying feedback from early adopters has been positive, with many using it to navigate the logistical demands of back-to-school.

Hauaino remembers his verdant, pre-volcano beach town on the east end of the Island of Hawaii as "just one of the beautifulest places on the island.
The lava moves in fits and starts, advancing for a few days, then stalling for weeks.
But Hauanio was determined to stay.
His own house was safe for the moment, but Hauanio was resigned to the fact that it would be next to go.
It is now a perfect geological specimen of pahoehoe.
The latter, said Janet Babb, a geologist with the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, is "jagged and rubbly" and can be found high on the slope above Kalapana.
Today, Kapalana is lovely in its own way, said Hauaino, who still lives in the house he rescued from the flow a quarter of a century ago.
Everything was like plentiful down here.
The U.S. Geological Survey documented the eruption of Kilauea and the lava\'s fierce path through 180 homes in Kalapana: "Slow-moving pahoehoe lava gradually spread through the community," the agency reported, "burning homes and covering parks, roads and gardens."
A week after his childhood home burned, he rolled his current house two miles up the road.
The lava, he said, "flows like water, but it\'s not.
There are two main kinds of lava: pahoehoe and aa.
It took down the water tank and set the modest structure on fire.
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) documented the eruption of Kilauea and the lava\'s fierce path through 180 homes in Kalapana: "Slow-moving pahoehoe lava gradually spread through the community," the agency reported, "burning homes and covering parks, roads and gardens."
As many wonder what to do, Hauanio and others still living down the road in Kalapana already know the answer.
They will wait, watch, then move.
Hauanio hired a crew with a bulldozer and a strong trailer and a week after his childhood home burned, he rolled his current house 2 miles up the road.
It is now a perfect geological example of pahoehoe.
There are many types of lava, Babb said \u2014 "ropy, wrinkled, billowy, slabby, sticky, glassy."
His own house was safe for now, but Hauanio knew that it would be next to go.
His children begged him to move the structure to a safe area.
In 1991, he watched the lava burn and destroy the house where he was born and raised.
The pahoehoe that covers the beach here could be shown in a natural history museum.
Today, Kapalana is lovely in its own way, Hauaino said.
"It has and will continue to adapt."

Now, for the second summer running, plane wreckage and human remains are being given up by Colony Glacier, more than a dozen miles from the crash site.
The mission to recover and, eventually, identify the human remains is being led by the Hawaii-based U.S. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command and its recovery leader, forensic anthropologist Gregory Berg.
They couldn\'t see and it flew into the side of Mount Gannett," said Doug Beckstead, Air Force historian on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.
No lost airmen or soldiers have yet been positively identified, but the MIA/POW command expects that to happen soon.
They are collected, labeled by precise location, kept in a morgue cooler, then shipped to the command laboratory on the island of Oahu, he said.
Fresh snow 8 feet deep was already covering the glacier and drifted snow near the wreckage piled up to hundreds of feet, according to a statement by Air Force 1st Lt. Thomas Sullivan, who was flown to the site by then-University of Alaska President Terris Moore, a pilot in the Civil Air Patrol.
The impact also appeared to trigger avalanches that further buried the debris.
Then this spring an Army Guard crew monitoring the area spotted a big yellow canister.
It was obvious it was debris from the wreckage," said Lt. Col. Matthew Schell with the Alaska Army National Guard.
A marker left last year has moved 300 yards down the glacier.
Last Tuesday, about 1,800 pounds of material was hauled off the glacier, the first batch removed this year, Crowley said.

In rough weather, battling strong winds, the plane blew 30 miles off course sometime after passing Middleton Island in the Gulf of Alaska, according to accident reports from the time.
The C-124 Globemaster was a heavy-lift workhorse nicknamed "Old Shaky" because of the racket from its big piston engines.
Crews last year removed all that they found, except one tire, Berg said.
"The things that we keep are things that are directly related to an individual on that aircraft, something that we can tie straight back to them," Berg said.
No lost airmen or soldiers have yet been positively identified, but the MIA/POW command expects that to happen soon.
The glacier-preserved remains are in better condition than those found in areas like Vietnam and include tissue as well as bones, Berg said.
Decades passed and the glacier slowly surged, giving up what it had buried in snow and ice and rubble.
And they may resume the effort next year, if the glacier continues to reveal what it has held for decades.

"I don\'t think we\'re going to go out today," says Stowe, 54, a harpooner and proud defender of an ancient, daring trade on the verge of disappearing.
Whaling was once a big and profitable business in Bequia (pronounced BECK-way) supporting at least a dozen whale boats.
"It\'s like carnival when you catch a whale," says Stowe, standing next to his beached 28-foot whale sailboat Persecution, inspecting the brass tip of a hand-thrown wooden harpoon.
Bess decided to retire from harpooning during a whale watching expedition to the Dominican Republic last year.
If it struck true, the whale would be hauled back to the whaling station on nearby Love Island and butchered.
After years of being a second harpooner, Stowe purchased his own whale boat and recruited his own crew of young seamen to train this season.
"Whaling is a tradition around Bequia," he says.
It\'s a passion that they have; it\'s something they are used to doing and people don\'t like change."
A native of Bequia, Mitchell is the daughter of former Prime Minister James Mitchell, whose government in the 1980s was the first to vote with pro-whaling Japan at the International Whaling Commission.
"We are no longer involved in the indigenous craftsmanship of whale hunting \'Moby Dick\' style."
"There are no whales here to watch," he says, scanning the rough and empty sea.
As my son said the other day, the only whale I want to watch is the one on my plate."
"It\'s like carnival when you catch a whale," says Stowe, standing next to his beached 28-foot whale sailboat Persecution, inspecting the brass tip of a hand-thrown wooden harpoon.
"Whaling is a tradition around Bequia," he says.
"We\'re using cellphones to locate where the whales are, and we\'re using speedboats to go up to the whale and strike the whale," he says.
"It\'s like carnival when you catch a whale," says Stowe, standing next to his beached 28-foot whale sailboat Persecution, inspecting the brass tip of a wooden harpoon.
Then, the harpooner, standing six to eight feet away, makes his throw.
Earlier this month, the International Court of Justice banned Japan from hunting whales in the icy waters of the Antarctic.
Published in 1851 by author Herman Melville, "Moby Dick" is an iconic novel about the pursuit of a great white whale.
This was despite concerns about inhumane killing techniques, use of speedboats, the targeting of baby whales to lure their mothers and the selling of the whale meat.
Although for today there are no whales in the choppy waters, he does believe whales will come back.
"Whaling is a tradition around Bequia," Stowe says.
Japan claims it is killing the mammals as part of scientific research.
They also argue that nothing justifies continued whaling in Bequia.
And as yet, no whales have been captured.
"I don\'t think we\'re going to go out today," says Kingsley Stowe.
There used to be at least a dozen whale boats hunting the huge mammals.
Under international law, islanders can kill no more than four whales during the four-month season that lasts from February to May.
"Whaling is a tradition around Bequia," which began in 1875, Stowe said.
Locals in Bequia like the taste of whale meat and use its oil.
Although for today there are no whales in the choppy waters, he says the whales will come back.
President Barack Obama pushed for his economic plan for the middle class on Aug. 28 as he honored Martin Luther King Jr. and the marchers who fought for civil rights 50 years ago.
The 1963 protest became the most iconic moment of the civil rights movement.
Speakers included former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, Oprah Winfrey and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the only speaker from the 1963 march.
Obama paid tribute to the 1963 marchers, both King and "those ordinary people who names never appear in the history books."
Obama, whose mother was white and father Kenyan, has wrestled with this racial identity and his connection to the movement that defined a generation of black political life.
Yet Obama has also criticized the civil rights movement, saying it is fractured.
Over the years, legitimate outrage over discrimination devolved into "excuse-making for criminal behavior," Obama said.

The recipe for the medieval cure comes from a thousand-year-old book called "Bald\'s Leechbook."
Only about 1 in 1,000 bacterial cells survived when treated with the ancient drug.
Researchers in England reached into the past to find a cure for a deadly infection.
The recipe for the remedy comes from a thousand-year-old book called "Bald\'s Leechbook."
In the lab, the thousand-year-old recipe was a powerful killer.
Only about 1 in 1,000 MRSA bacterial cells survived the ancient drug.
Later, the researchers tested the drug in infected wounds in mice.
For decades, Asian-Americans have clustered on the coasts, but in recent years thousands have moved to the South, remaking communities in the process.
Between 2000 and 2010, Asian-Americans were the fastest-growing ethnic group in the South, increasing 69 percent during that period, according to an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by the group Asian Americans Advancing Justice, which advocates on behalf of the community.
The average growth among the 16 states and the District of Columbia (which the census identifies as the South) was 63 percent.
The Asian-American newcomers, most of whom are transplants from liberal states on the coasts, also could change the political face of the conservative South.
Arkansas, notably, saw an increase in Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders of 151 percent from 2000 to 2010, thanks in large part to an influx of people from the Marshall Islands.

How well each state is positioned to deal with these issues and others will vary as well, in part, based on cultural and political realities, and history of immigration.

Compared with other parts of the country, some states in the South have little experience in hosting large immigrant communities.
In Georgia, registered Asian-American voters doubled, while turnout increased 168 percent.
For example, refugees from parts of Southeast Asia are likely to have very different backgrounds and qualifications than a highly educated professional from India.
Some, like Tennessee, have long been a destination for refugees, and might be better positioned to respond to a changing population.
For decades, Asian-Americans have clustered on the coasts, but in recent years thousands have moved to the South, remaking communities in the process.
By comparison, the Latino population gained 57 percent in the South.
The explosive growth presents several dilemmas for state and local governments.
Some cities in Georgia are encouraging Asian-American-owned businesses to have signs in English, so law enforcement will know where to go in an emergency.
Asian-Americans, like most minority voting groups, currently trend Democratic.
By comparison, the Latino population gained 57 percent in the South.
The number actually casting ballots skyrocketed 180 percent.
The South includes 16 states from Maryland and Delaware to Florida to Texas and Oklahoma.
In Georgia and North Carolina that population soared more than 80 percent.
In Atlanta, Georgia, Asian-Americans make up just 5 percent of the population, while Latinos make up 10 percent.
There are 111 different languages spoken near one Georgia school district.

Some Southern states have little experience hosting large immigrant communities.
For example, refugees from parts of Southeast Asia are likely to have different backgrounds and skills than a highly educated professional from India.
Communities in the South are starting to change.
The Asian-American population grew faster in the South than any other region of the country.
The South includes 16 states from Maryland and Delaware to Florida to Texas and Oklahoma.
Communities in the South now have to educate students who do not speak English as a first language.
For generations, Asian-Americans have lived on the coasts of the United States.
Asian-Americans were the fastest-growing ethnic group in the South between 2000 and 2010.
"A lot of them are catching up, and it takes a lot more to turn the ship."
But even he was having a hard time wrapping his head around the massive compilation.
Mother Jones blogger Chris Mooney praised Johnson for summing up [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) in an "understandable, and even moving, way."
Within two weeks of publication last month, the post received nearly 40,000 hits.
"I think there\'s a hunger for a simple and clear" presentation of global warming, said Sightline\'s Anna Fahey.
Johnson, though, prefers not to engage in what he considers mainly a political debate.
His work on ocean monitoring has convinced him that some changes caused by global warming are detectable now, and more are certain in the future.
Johnson, though, was already well acquainted with it.
Eventually, he agreed to allow the Seattle environmental group Sightline to post the booklet on its website.
It might seem like an odd choice for a scientist.
He sees this as a way to keep his messages brief and positive.
The aquarium responded by sending the animal to SeaWorld where it was able to live with other whales.
Some aquariums that are keeping the animals are nonetheless making big changes.
SeaWorld recently announced plans to give orcas more room.

Nonetheless, more and more people agree that whales should not be in aquariums.
"Today we sense we are close to be being able to alter human heredity," Nobel Laureate and California Institute of Technology virologist David Baltimore said Dec. 1 at the opening of a much-anticipated human gene editing summit that took place in Washington, D.C. Gene editing, or tweaking the human genome with additions, subtractions or alterations, is becoming increasingly realistic with modern technologies.
Once the consensus statement is issued, patients, lab scientists, ethicists and medical workers will be carefully watching what comes next.

Archaeologists working in Indonesia say prehistoric paintings of hands and animals were created nearly 40,000 years ago.
The age of the Indonesian paintings suggests that Europe can no longer claim to be the sole birthplace of art.
"I can say that it was a great \u2014 and very nice \u2014 surprise to read their findings," said Wil Roebroeks, an archaeologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the study.
The researchers said they had no preconceived ideas of how old the rock art was when they started on this project about three years ago.
The technique was also used to establish the minimum dates of rock art in Western Europe.
"The ratio between the two elements acts as a kind of geological clock to date the formation of the calcium carbonate deposits," explained Maxime Aubert.
Using this method, the researchers determined that one of the hand outlines they sampled was made at least 39,900 years ago.
A painting of an animal known as a pig deer was at least 35,400 years old.
In Europe, the oldest known cave painting was of a red disk found in a cave in El Castillo, Spain, which is at least 40,800 years old.

While their cases are being processed by immigration authorities, most of these minors are released to family members or sponsors who are told the children must be enrolled in school.
In Miami, the school board voted to seek federal aid after Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said 300 foreign-born students, many from Honduras and traveling alone, enrolled toward the end of the school year.
Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Attorney General Eric Holder issued new guidance in May reminding districts that a 1982 Supreme Court ruling gives all children the right to enroll in school, regardless of immigration status.
The government estimates that 90,000 children, primarily from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, could make the journey alone by this fall, and that as many as 145,000 of them could arrive next year.

The Texas police officer who has been widely condemned for his aggressive handling of black teenagers at a pool party has resigned.
His attorney announced the resignation on Tuesday.
The video, which was shot by a bystander, garnered millions of views on YouTube.
It shows Casebolt shouting and cursing at teenagers who do not appear to be acting violently or aggressively, with Casebolt wrestling some black teenagers to the ground.
However, the McKinney Fraternal Order of Police, the union that represents Casebolt, said Monday that "this was not a racially motivated incident."
In a situation in which officers are facing large crowds and trying to restore the peace, Bradford said, "you would want to take calming actions to calm the party down" and break up the crowd "in a lawful manner."

Texas police officer Eric Casebolt has been heavily criticized for his treatment of black teenagers at a pool party.
The police department decided to punish him after a cellphone video was released.
The girl was wearing nothing but a swimsuit.
On Monday protesters gathered to express their anger.
The Casebolt video has added to the growing anger over police behavior.
Under segregation, blacks were kept from using certain whites-only public spaces.
Police should then get people to leave the area, while being very careful not to use unnecessary force.
Not every kid can say he made the discovery of a lifetime before he started kindergarten.
And this find is the most complete of all, said SMU paleontologist Louis Jacobs, author of "Lone Star Dinosaurs."
Nodosaurs were kind of the armadillos of the dinosaur world \u2014 short, squatty and covered in armored plates with a soft underbelly.
The bones were found in what was then the Western Interior Seaway, an extension of the Gulf of Mexico.
The only one who seems unimpressed by the rare discovery is the boy who made it.
While Winkler calls the Mansfield Nodosaurus "Beach Ball," Wylie has his own name for his dinosaur \u2014 Ralphie \u2014 for another reptile, his favorite Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle \u2014 Raphael.

When it comes to the sassy princesses who star in Disney\'s hit film "Frozen," retailers don\'t want to let them go.
"When you have a jackpot like \'Frozen,\' it can go on forever," said Jason Moser, an analyst at the Motley Fool.
"Frozen" is especially attractive because girl-friendly entertainment products tend to outsell boy\'s properties by 10 percent, he said.
"With girls there are a lot more fashion items."
The popularity of "Frozen" may eventually prove to be its undoing, some observers said.
"When you begin to play with it or eat it or dress it up, we want to make sure that emotional connection" \u2014 the same feelings that viewers have while watching the movie \u2014 is there as well, Silverman said.

Now, capitalizing on consumers\' fear of germs, companies are adding tiny, powerful silver particles to cutting boards, underwear, yoga mats, running shirts, socks and an expanding array of other "antibacterial" goods.
Such products are made possible by recent advances in technology that allow manufacturers to create nano-sized silver and incorporate it into various materials.
(A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter; a human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide.)
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently began requiring manufacturers of nanosilver to register their products, saying the particles could pose different risks than conventional silver.
"Manufacturers shy away from labeling things in their products unless it\'s trendy.
Silver kills germs when it oxidizes and releases silver ions, which are lethal to bacteria and yeast.
Ancient civilizations used the metal to treat open wounds, and American pioneers tossed silver coins into water storage barrels to keep water fresh.
Nanoscale silver products have been safely used in swimming pools and drinking water purification since the 1970s, said Rosalind Volpe, executive director of the Silver Nanotechnology Working Group.
In general, experts agree that humans can safely tolerate fairly high doses of silver.
Like other germ-killers, including antibiotics, nanosilver also could upset the delicate balance of bacteria inside the digestive tract, said Marina Quadros, associate director of the Virginia Tech Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology.
"If we start using tons of silver nanoparticles and a lot more are going down the drain, then we might start to have an effect we haven\'t seen in the past," said Amy Pruden, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who is investigating whether silver nanoparticles in waste streams can stimulate antibiotic resistance in microbes.

But that only narrowed the possibilities to 19 dates spanning from November 1872 to January 1873.
"That suggests you\'re looking at a high tide, near a rising sun in a certain azimuth," Olson said.
On Nov. 15, 1872, at 7:35 a.m., the weather observer noted light winds from the southeast with mist, fog and calm seas.
The Impressionist art movement began Nov. 13, 1872, right around 7:35 a.m. local time.
Many have mistrusted the abbreviated date "72" that the artist brushed beside his name.
Olson pored over hundreds of photographs and scores of historical maps of Le Havre, a port city on the Normandy coast.
The tall, multiple-masted ships painted by Monet could only have been in the distant outer harbor if the tides were high.
However, Monet experts opted for the November date, since Monet dated his painting "72."
They also dated a Monet painting of a sunset near the cliffs on the Normandy coast as well as works by Vincent Van Gogh.
Olson organized a re-enactment of the shot in 2005.
The museum published a "biography" of the Monet work, co-written by Olson to go along with the exhibit.

"One of the really overarching questions about Mars is whether there was ever life," Bruce Jakosky, MAVEN principal investigator at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told reporters last week.
"Both India and NASA are really quite interested in cooperating and correlating data sets," said Jim Green, NASA\'s planetary science division director.
For clues, MAVEN will watch to see when and how gas is currently stripped off the top of the atmosphere \u2014 a process that is thought to be driven by interactions with the solar wind.
The spacecraft has been traveling toward Mars since its launch 10 months ago, in November 2013.
"The odds of having an approach that close to Mars are about one in a million years," Jakosky said, "so it\'s really luck that we get the opportunity here."
Eventually, it will shrink its current 35-hour wider orbit to a tighter circle that takes just four and a half hours to complete.

The other explanation is that it floated up and was lost to space.
At first, Ashok Yadav ignored the patches of pink skin on his arm.
But when pale sores erupted on his body and he lost sensation in his fingertips, a doctor issued the devastating diagnosis: Yadav had leprosy.
People continue to hide their diagnoses from families and loved ones out of fear they will be ostracized.
Worldwide, the number of new leprosy patients dropped from around 10 million in 1991 to around 230,000 last year as countries intensified efforts to fight the disease.
In India, hospitals and clinics began treating patients with a combination of drugs that effectively kills mycobacterium leprae, the germ that causes leprosy.
But pockets of the country continue to have problems with leprosy, including in the central state of Chattisgarh, Maharashtra in western India and Bihar and West Bengal in the east.
"They pay us a monthly allowance of 1,800 rupees ($29), which is a pittance," he said.
But when pale sores erupted on his body and he lost sensation in his fingertips, a doctor issued the devastating diagnosis: Yadav had leprosy.
Health workers are trying to spread the word that leprosy is not hereditary and does not spread through normal contact.
Worldwide, the number of new leprosy patients dropped from around 10 million in 1991 to around 230,000 last year as countries intensified efforts to fight the disease.
In India, hospitals and clinics began treating patients with a combination of drugs that effectively kills mycobacterium leprae, the germ that causes leprosy.
According to the health ministry, during 2012-2013 India detected 134,752 new cases of leprosy, slightly more than the 127,295 cases reported a year earlier.
The money does not even pay for the bandages that leprosy patients use every day on their sores, said Uttam Kumar, another resident.
Some 10,000 people live there, including the children of leprosy patients.
"Everyone has their own sorrows, but our pain is the same."
But when pale sores erupted on his body and he lost sensation in his fingertips, a doctor said the devastating word: Yadav had leprosy.
"What followed was like a nightmare," said Yadav, who has lived in Kasturba Gram, a leper colony outside New Delhi, since he found out he got the disease 30 years ago.
The stigma, or fear, of leprosy endures in India, even though the country has made great strides against the disease, which is neither highly contagious nor fatal.

Agarwal says the rise in cases is the result of an intensified campaign against leprosy.
That was slightly more than the 127,295 cases reported a year earlier.
But he spent months on the road before finding a refuge in the one-room shabby apartments of Kasturba Gram.
Thirty years ago, Ashok Yadav was ignoring the pink skin that showed up in patches on his arm.
A doctor told him the terrible news: Yadav had leprosy.
Still, many people are afraid of the disease.
They are afraid they will be asked to leave like Yadav.
In 2012, India detected 134,752 new cases of leprosy.
Agarwal says the rise in cases is the result of a bigger push against leprosy.
It will, he says, revolutionize the search for extraterrestrial life.
It also would eliminate the potential risks of bringing home alien diseases, said Ames Director Simon "Pete" Worden.
The game plan was to load samples of the bacteria into a genetic sequencer.
That device, which downloads a DNA sequence and prints out the nucleic acids that correspond to the sequence, will be available for sale in 2014.
The U.S. government could use it to identify biological agents in the field \u2014 perhaps dropping a sequencing unit from an aircraft.
Additionally, health agencies could use it during major outbreaks of viruses.
Venter said the key to finding evidence of life on Mars would be digging deep into the planet, perhaps as deep as a kilometer or more, where water may exist.
Data from the Kepler space telescope suggest that every fifth star in our galaxy has a planet that might hold liquid water \u2014 a key ingredient for life.
That means billions of planets in the Milky Way have the potential to be inhabited by living organisms, scientists say.

For that reason, the team plan to use it in their Mojave test run.
And he says scientists will then be able to do something simply amazing: They will be able to reconstruct living copies of alien lifeforms in a lab.
Scientists believe this is the sort of thing that may be hiding out on other worlds.
This will determine the unique order of four repeating nucleotides, or chemical "letters," found in the bacteria.
The desert field experiment was a test of the unit that would send back information from Mars.
And Venter says his technology will be able to decode the DNA it finds.

What resembles gibberish to anyone without a degree in computer science could help NBA teams find optimal ways to grab rebounds and defend pick and rolls through a proprietary software system developed by Maheswaran and Chang.
As the cursor flitted across his laptop screen, Maheswaran displayed a dizzying array of visual tools that teams could use to tweak lineups and position players for favorable outcomes.
But the system Maheswaran and Chang have licensed to four NBA teams through their start-up company, Second Spectrum, could influence the way their clients play and even construct their rosters.
Assistant general manager Kirk Lacob, son of Warriors majority owner Joe Lacob, said the team checked its defensive rotations, lineups and fatigue metrics and made tweaks accordingly.
said Lacob, whose team uses a Palo Alto, Calif.-based data processing company called MOCAP Analytics.
The data is electronically transmitted to STATS to be categorized into passes, dribbles, shots and rebounds, among other groups.
"You can\'t give players a boatload of information and expect them to implement it out on the floor; it just doesn\'t work that way," Rambis said.

In all, their numbers in the former Soviet republics could be between 100 and 200, according to researchers.
African-Americans were shunned because they were foreigners, not because they were black, their descendants said.
Today, Russia has a racism problem, as many people have moved to the country from Africa.
Growing up in Russia \u2014 then part of the Soviet Union \u2014 Emilia Tynes-Mensah did the same things other children did.
Today, fewer than 50 descendants of these African-Americans are believed to still live in Russia.
In her home, though, there was also American jazz and Thanksgiving celebrations.
The Soviets gave them special treatment.
Nonetheless, back in America he could only find work washing dishes in a restaurant, his daughter recalled.
Tynes was sent to various Soviet republics to teach people how to raise ducks and other waterfowl.

But Mars is the only place where we have solid evidence for liquid that sits right there in the open air.
We know that because of the extremely low pressure on Mars, water has a boiling point of just a few degrees Celsius, after which it evaporates.
In the new study, published Monday in Nature Geoscience, a different group of researchers took the search for perchlorates one step further: They went looking for them in the very RSL features thought to be formed by salty liquid.
They found perchlorates in abundance - and it seems like they have been getting hydrated.
They used a technique called spectroscopy, which keeps track of what spectra of light an object absorbs in order to make conclusions about its composition.
With this technique, scientists can identify glass, ice and other substances from miles above the surface.
Morten Bo Madsen of the University of Copenhagen - who co-authored the April study, but was not involved in the latest work - said the new results were significant.
Ojha pointed out that the MRO\'s resolution is too low to pick up many of the smaller "wet" features on Mars, and that a new orbiter could get even more information, especially since the MRO only allows us to examine Mars\'s surface at what Ojha believes is the driest point in the day.
And in theory, it could be extracted and used by astronauts on a Mars mission.

President Barack Obama prodded Congress to raise wages and secure the social safety net as he issued an overarching appeal Wednesday to correct economic inequalities that he said make it harder for a child to escape poverty.
"The basic bargain at the heart of our economy has frayed," the president said in remarks at a nonprofit community center a short drive from the White House in one of Washington\'s most impoverished neighborhoods.
He acknowledged his administration\'s "poor execution" in rolling out the flawed health care website that was supposed to be an easy portal for purchasing insurance, while blaming Republicans for a "reckless" shutdown of the government.
And he noted that in the United States, a child born into the bottom 20 percent of income levels has less than a 5 percent chance of making it to the top income levels and is 10 times likelier to stay where he is \u2014 worse than other industrial countries such as Canada, Germany and France.

Martin, a tackle, remained absent from practice Monday one week after he suddenly left the team because of emotional issues.
After beating Cincinnati in overtime Thursday, the Dolphins had three days off while the Martin story mushroomed.
Teammates praised both Incognito and Martin and expressed regret regarding their absences, but said it was time to get on with business.
"When I got here, he was a guy who had everybody laughing and told jokes," said McKinnie, a tackle who joined the team two weeks ago.
"You would hope if stuff was getting out of hands, there were guys in the locker room who would step up and maybe nip it in the bud before it got out of control."
Their troubled relationship may help explain his NFL-high 35 sacks.

The electric barrier on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal that is considered the last line of defense to stop an Asian carp invasion of Lake Michigan has a problem: Fish can swim through it.
Concerned that the barrier was too weak to repel juvenile fish, in 2011 the Army Corps increased its voltage.
Federal officials stress they do not believe Asian carp are yet probing the barrier.
The study is expected to have a range of options, but Great Lakes advocates want the canal physically plugged to stop Asian carp and other unwanted species from swimming freely between the Great Lakes and Mississippi basin.
Josh Mogerman, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said news of the electrical barrier problems is further evidence that the federal government has to find a more permanent solution to the Asian carp problem.
The study also revealed that small fish are not always incapacitated by the electrical current in the water.
In fact, a sonar camera lowered into the canal at the barrier site regularly captured schools of fish swimming freely through the barrier.
Of those 72 samples, entire schools of fish, not believed to be Asian carp, were recorded swimming through the barrier 61 percent of the time.
The new study may prompt changes in the way barges are configured and how the barrier operates.
"We\'re going to do more analysis and work with the barge community and the Coast Guard to see how we can move forward."

The electric fence on the Chicago shipping canal is the last thing stopping a type of dangerous fish from getting into Lake Michigan.
And that wave pulls the fish through the fence and into Lake Michigan.
The study also showed that the metal barges can suck electricity out of the water as they go through the fence zone.
The Army Corps put a camera put into the canal near the fence to check.
Entire schools of fish were recorded swimming through the fence.
Of those 72 samples, the fish made it past the fence six out of every 10 times they tried.

Only two California school districts, Sierra Sands Unified and San Diego Unified, have said they could meet the matching requirement.
"We lost millions on this program because of sequestration," Wright said, referring to the mandatory federal budget cuts of 2013.
School officials would like to replace the roof, upgrade playground equipment and purchase new doors for classrooms and offices, which currently only lock from the outside.
There also are electrical improvements to consider, such as upgrading lighting and installing air conditioning.
Public school districts are often able to cover major maintenance and construction costs with the help of voter-approved bond money generated through property taxes.
Last year, the California Department of Education asked the Department of Finance to provide $61 million in funding, which would cover the 20 percent matching for the 10 California schools on the list; the request was denied.
State Senator Jean Fuller, a Republican from Bakersfield, also proposed a bill that would have provided the 20 percent matching to some of the base schools in need of renovations.
Muroc Joint Unified has tried to raise the matching funds on its own, chief business officer, Trevor Walker, said.
Despite saying that it could provide the matching funds, the district is struggling to do so, its superintendent, Ernie Bell, said.

Public school districts are often able to cover major maintenance and construction costs with the help of money raised through property taxes.
That does not work for military base schools because they are on federal land, which is not taxed.
But the legislation did not even make it to a vote.
Without the federal aid, Fuller said, California may eventually have to pay the total cost of repairs itself.
Muroc Joint Unified has tried to raise the matching funds on its own, chief business officer Trevor Walker said.
However, it will only pay 80 percent of the cost of the repairs.
To be able to use the money, school districts or their states must provide the remaining 20 percent.

Ninety-five percent of California is currently experiencing severe drought.
As a result, wildlife refuge managers are warning that there could be major bird die-offs this fall and spring as waterfowl and shorebirds crowd too few acres of wetlands.
The flocks landing in the pop-up wetlands are one of the few bright spots for wildlife in the state this fall.
A lush, wet winter in Canada and Alaska created prime breeding conditions for birds, meaning more birds than usual are coming to California wetlands.
Rice farmers \u2014 who flood their fields in winter to let old, harvested rice stalks rot away \u2014 became essential substitute providers of wetlands.
Least sandpipers and greater yellowleg migratory shorebirds stood alongside dirt irrigation ditches, waiting for the fields to fill.
The field now filling with dowichers is one of the first to be used this fall under a new program of "pop-up" habitats.
Conservationists are temporarily renting 14,000 acres from rice farmers.

In two weeks, Munger said, there will be thousands of birds, swimming, resting and hunting bugs.
Without these fields providing a rare strip of wetlands, the birds would have a hard time getting "the weight and feed and energy they need to keep moving on," he said.
Just hours after the field was flooded two weeks ago, hundreds of migrating birds appeared.
"It was incredible," says biologist Simon Avery, a field monitor for the Nature Conservancy, which thought up the pop-up wetlands.
As a result, more birds than usual are coming to California wetlands.

Five children at a KinderCare Learning Center in suburban Chicago have been diagnosed with measles, Illinois and Cook County health officials announced Thursday.
Cook County officials say any resident who is unvaccinated and experiences measles symptoms of a high fever and rash should call their local health department and their doctor.
Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that can cause severe health complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis and death.
Infected people are contagious from four days before their rash starts through four days afterward, according to state and county health officials.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians all recommend that children get their first dose of the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine at 12 to 15 months old and a second shot at 4 to 6 years old, before starting kindergarten.
They are not moving air well and they get into trouble," he said, adding that pneumonia is often a complication.
If your child has only the first dose of the measles vaccine, he or she may not be fully protected.
Those who are too young to get vaccinated are protected by the majority who are inoculated, called herd immunity.
However, when the vaccination rate drops below 95 percent, a community loses its herd immunity to highly contagious diseases such as measles, Tan explained.

Governor Chis Christie of New Jersey chomped down on a jelly doughnut and mocked his own weight on "The Late Show with David Letterman."
Ten days later, he underwent a secret medical procedure designed to help him lose weight.
No mention of the procedure at an event in Lavallette, New Jersey, two days after the surgery or at any of the other meetings Christie held that week.
"If I had a choice, I wouldn\'t have ever talked about it," Christie said on Tuesday, confirming a news report that detailed his surgery nearly three months ago.
The governor, who throughout his career has joked about his weight on television, in social media and before countless audiences, said it was his plan all along never to acknowledge publicly that he had undergone gastric band surgery, more commonly known as lap band surgery.
It is, Christie said, a deeply private matter for a man who has struggled for decades with his weight and a matter for him and his family, not for public consumption.
And he insisted it has absolutely nothing to do with politics, even though he is up for re-election and is persistently said to be a potential 2016 Republican candidate for president.
Christie told dozens of reporters in a televised news conference on Tuesday that he decided to have the surgery because of his wife, Mary Pat, and their four children and sealed the choice after turning 50 in September.
"My long-term goal is to get myself into a position where I\'m healthier and I can live a longer life and be an active parent and hopefully someday grandparent," Christie said, saying that his youngest two children are in elementary school.
How much weight he has lost, how much he weighs now, and how much he plans to lose were all questions Christie said he would not answer, saying they are nobody\'s business and calling the media attention "ridiculous" and "silly."
Jets coach Rex Ryan offered his personal experiences with the same surgery in a phone conversation, but Christie said he never told the coach that he was considering the surgery at the time.
Less than two weeks before his surgery, Christie appeared on "The Late Show," where he pulled a jelly doughnut out of his pocket and took a bite as Letterman asked Christie if his jokes about the governor\'s weight bothered him.
Christie said his heft was "fair game" but also said, "I\'m basically the healthiest fat guy you\'ve ever seen in your life."
The remark, which Christie said his children heard, drew fire from the outspoken governor who called her a "hack who wants five minutes on TV."
During a news conference with reporters after the Letterman appearance, he said "there\'s always a plan" to shed pounds.
"Now that he\'s governor, it doesn\'t matter because as long as he hasn\'t had a health scare \u2014 and the only thing that we know about is a trip to the emergency room for an asthma attack \u2014 the only thing people judge him on is his performance," Murray said.
He pointed to an October 2011 Monmouth University/NJ Press Media Poll in which 20 percent of those surveyed said it was appropriate to talk about weight in a presidential race.
"Let\'s be fair, you have to take him on his word on that because he\'s been talking about that for years, but you have to think that the looming presidential election in three years, which we all know he wants to run in, gave him that extra push to try something he wouldn\'t have otherwise," Murray said.
Governor Chis Christie of New Jersey chomped down on a jelly doughnut and mocked his own weight on "The Late Show with David Letterman."
Ten days later, he underwent a secret medical procedure designed to help him lose weight.
No mention of the procedure at an event in Lavallette, New Jersey, two days after the surgery or at any of the other meetings Christie held that week.
"It\'s nobody else\'s business," Christie said, adding that it became public only because a reporter from the New York Post asked him a direct question about the procedure.
"My long-term goal is to get myself into a position where I\'m healthier and I can live a longer life and be an active parent and hopefully someday grandparent," Christie said, saying that his youngest two children are in elementary school.
The only people in the administration who knew were his chief of staff and chief counsel, Christie said.
Christie said his heft was "fair game" but also said, "I\'m basically the healthiest fat guy you\'ve ever seen in your life."
The next day, former White House physician Connie Mariano, who described herself as a Christie fan, told CNN that she worries about his "dying in office."

On Thursday, two consumer advocacy groups often critical of corporate advertising tactics \u2014 the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and the Center for a New American Dream \u2014 criticized Barbie as a flawed role model for little girls and launched a petition drive urging the Girl Scouts of the USA to end the partnership.
"This is product placement at its worst," said New American Dream\'s executive director, Wendy Philleo, who described herself as a longtime admirer of the Girl Scouts.
In announcing the partnership with Mattel last year, Girl Scouts CEO Anna Maria Chavez depicted both her own organization and Barbie as "American icons."
Said Susan Linn, the campaign director: "The website is little more than an interactive ad for Barbie promoting the brand\'s insidious message that women really are what they wear."
Linn said she communicated privately with the Girl Scouts last year, hoping they would end the Mattel partnership without the need for a public advocacy campaign, but those efforts failed.
It also has helped block proposed state laws that would have allowed advertising on school buses.
"Together, we are teaching girls that their futures are wide open with possibilities," Chavez said at the time.
It now reports a membership of 54,000, many of them parents.

This time it is over over a business partnership between her manufacturer, Mattel, and the Girl Scouts.
On Thursday, two consumer advocacy groups often critical of corporate advertising tactics launched a petition drive urging the Girl Scouts of the USA to end the partnership.
Her Charlottesville, Va.-based group opposes the commercialization of American culture.
The toy company was widely criticized for the placement, although it received some praise.
Anticipating the criticism, Mattel promoted the campaign with the slogan "unapologetic."
Notably, it forced several companies to halt or modify advertising claiming that certain videos and other products could help infants learn.
This would "improve quality of life, protect the environment, and promote social justice."
Due to its size and high profile, the Girl Scouts have been a frequent target of criticism over the years.
"This is product placement at its worst," said New American Dream\'s executive director, Wendy Philleo.
Parisi said Mattel gave the Girl Scouts $2 million to carry out the Barbie-themed programs.
Notably, it forced several companies to halt or modify advertising claiming that certain videos and other products could help infants learn.
Girl Scouts will also be able to earn a Barbie participation patch.
It is the first Girl Scout uniform patch that is sponsored by a corporation.
Viewers are usually not aware that the placement is paid for.

The evacuation of a filthy Roma camp last week has forced Sweden to come to terms with a troubling new reality: For the first time in generations, the egalitarian nation is witnessing people living in wretched poverty, without electricity and running water.
Their numbers rose sharply last year, and they now number around 4,500, he said.
They are only eligible for emergency aid, including a few days of food and housing at homeless shelters and assistance to return home.
"I heard from others it was easier to earn money here," said Maria Carmen, a 38-year-old Roma woman from Romania who came to Sweden two weeks ago.
In August, a far-right-wing political party placed controversial ads in the Stockholm subway apologizing to foreign tourists for "the mess" caused by the beggars.
Trash piled up between the flimsy homes, and neighbors complained as the stench of human waste and toxic bonfires permeated the area.
Valfridsson said that the best way for Swedes to help the Roma is to support efforts to help them in their home countries.
Helping them requires more than "dropping coins in a cup," he said.
The evacuation of a filthy Roma camp last week has forced Sweden to come to terms with a troubling new reality: For the first time in generations, the egalitarian nation is witnessing people living in wretched poverty, without electricity and running water.

In addition, homeowners could use the software to create a digital tour of their houses before putting them up for sale, Roumeliotis said.
While the software is being designed to work on an upcoming Google smartphone, it will also work on existing smartphones.
Notably, it doesn\'t use much processing power, about as much as the game "Angry Birds," Roumeliotis said.
Google often spends years tweaking and testing  a new product before releasing it to the public, Strawn said.
"There\'s a lot of valuable brainpower in the university system, and that\'s what Google needs to move these projects forward," he said.
Roumeliotis points out that today, you could map the inside of the Mall of America, but it would take many computers and a lot of time.
Managers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in Texas have a new task to add to their list of duties: asking customers if they have a permit to carry a handgun.
Cashiers or door greeters who see someone with a gun are to alert the highest-ranking employee, who is to approach the customer and ask to see the paperwork.
Gun-control advocates, meanwhile, are shunning stores that allow customers to bear arms, saying no one should have to shop where they feel unsafe.
An establishment can lose its liquor license if it "knowingly allows" a person to bring an illegal firearm on the premises, said Chris Porter, spokesman for the agency.
"The strongest statement businesses can make for their customers\' safety and care is getting that sign up," said Alexandra Chasse, a spokeswoman for the Texas chapter of Moms Demand Action.

The National Assessment of Educational Progress in 2013 showed that only 32 percent of boys and 38 percent of girls were reading proficiently in fourth grade.
Parents register their children to use the website, which promotes reading through games and enlisting celebrities to read books.
The United Way sends the parents emails about the importance of reading, as well as coupons from corporate partners "to encourage and reward them," O\'Dowd said.
"There\'s definitely a great need in Tarrant County, and we\'d love to be able to provide these resources for all of our schools," she said.

Research shows that reading by third grade is critical for later school success.
"There\'s definitely a great need in Tarrant  County," Furney said.
As an alternative to cutting a lot of programs, districts went the route of charging fees for sports events, uniforms, after-school activities \u2014 and eventually transportation."
That\'s just really unfortunate and a shame," said Mike Martin, executive director of the National Association for Pupil Transportation, which represents school transportation directors.
Students in grades 7 through 12 in Franklin, Massachusetts, pay $325 each, with a cap of $975 per family.
And the Poway Unified School District in San Diego County, California, bills $575 a year per child, with a cap of $1,437 for three or more children.
"It costs $3.5 million a year to run the transportation program.
The state only gives us $86,000."
Parents of students living farther away who want bus service must pay for it.
Technology fees, book fees, athletic fees, and now bus fees.
Domenech of the school superintendents group said he hopes that as the economy continues to improve, districts that have been charging fees will begin offering free transportation once again.
The Jeffco Public Schools in Golden, Colorado, for example, charge $150 a child per year.
It used to be that when children hopped onto a yellow school bus to get to and from their classes, taxpayers picked up the tab.

"It is the first time it really got real for our community, because it brought Ebola from Dallas right into our school community," said Kristin Courtney, spokeswoman for the school district.
The student will use technology and interactive programs to complete schoolwork and not fall behind.
They told him that their children were being advised to stay away from day care facilities.
In the Highland Park school district in Dallas, Superintendent Dawson Orr posted a message Friday on its website.
The district also said its nursing staff has been trained to spot symptoms of Ebola.
And in a proactive approach, the district has a section on its website called "Help with rumor control."
An example is questions about an elementary school student and his mother being on the same Frontier Airlines flight with Vinson.
The district had not even had any reported exposure to Ebola.
In a release called "Know the Plan," the district outlines their questioning method for possible exposures.
North Texas school districts continued their assault on the Ebola virus Friday.
He said this was especially necessary in the case of schoolchildren.
Two weeks ago, Thomas Eric Duncan became the first person in the United States to be diagnosed with Ebola.
They also tried to stop people from spreading rumors about the disease.

In the spring of 2012, 6-year-old Emma Whitehead was close to death.
Those T-cells were then infected with a disabled form of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
The experimental procedure made Emma very ill. She was placed on a ventilator to help her breathe and her body temperature reached 105 degrees.
The modified T-cells that had been inserted into her body eventually began to grow and started to fight the cancer in her system.
Her fever had decreased and she was able to breathe on her own again.
When that child survived, it was an amazing event."
A handful of adults have also tried to cure their cancer with the disabled HIV procedure.
The modified T-cells not only destroy cancer cells, they also destroy some healthy cells, which means patients are at risk of becoming sick from infection.
While the economics are an important aspect of this experimental treatment, researchers and leukemia patients alike would like to find a cure for the disease - no matter what the cost.

Mike Huckabee, the folksy former governor, preacher and television host, entered the 2016 presidential race on Tuesday with a base of loyal supporters from his prior White House run, but he faces a cast of potential rivals that is larger and stronger than in 2008.
Now everyone knows who he is," said Bob Vander Plaats, who served as Huckabee\'s Iowa co-chairman in 2008 and is currently uncommitted.
A poll by NBC and The Wall Street Journal released Monday, however, shows that just over half of registered GOP voters said they could see themselves casting a ballot for the former governor, well below support for Rubio, Walker and former Florida Gov.
Country versus country club was a constant contrast Huckabee drew against Romney, and one he will likely make against Bush, who is expected to run.
He was castigated for supporting some tax increases when he was governor.

On Monday, Dr. Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina announced long-shot plans to seek the White House.
Others interested in the White House and popular with evangelicals include former Texas Governor Rick Perry, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum.
"People, just by nature, are kind of drawn to the new car smell,"  said Vander Plaats.
"So people are going to want to take a test drive, kick the tires, and sit inside all the new cars, look at all the new candidates and see if that\'s the direction they want to go," Vander Plaats said that Huckabee\'s hope will be to "persevere, stay the course," and hope that his followers return to vote for him.
Rubio, Walker and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush received far more support by Republicans in the study.
Both states are dominated by evangelical voters and hold two of the first nominating contests in the nation.

A makeshift bucket brigade hauled 14 pails of mud and slush from the tent that Um Mahmoud shares with a dozen other Syrian refugees in a ramshackle settlement here in the Bekaa Valley, now blanketed with snow that lends an alpine sheen to the rugged stretch that extends to the Syrian border.

The stunning vistas were of little solace to displaced Syrians, many of whom were found in their improvised enclaves clearing out the snow, slush and mud that had made an already arduous life more grueling.
Tiny Lebanon is now home to more than 1 million Syrian refugees, officials say; that means that about 1 in 5 residents of the country is a Syrian who has fled the civil war next door.
This is a nation where political power is carefully allocated among Christians, Druze, Sunni Muslims and Shiite Muslims.
Aid arrives irregularly, and in haphazard fashion, refugees say, despite the work of United Nations relief teams and humanitarian agencies.
"It has been freezing cold here and fuel was like gold," said Ahmad Awadh, a resident of another Bekaa-area camp.
A majority of the tents appear to have both portable heaters and stoves, provided by various aid groups, and some have electrical connections.
Still, residents complain that delivery of aid is sporadic, enrolling children in schools is next to impossible and finding a job is illusory.
Given the dire situation in Syria, many reckoned they were lucky to be in Lebanon, despite the many shortcomings of life as refugees.

Or, as is happening more frequently in China, they discover that livestock is missing or mauled.
In China, the number of Siberian tigers living in the wild (far smaller than those in captivity) has been listed in government statistics at between 18 and 22 for some years, said Li Zhixing, who has worked for decades on tiger protection.
"I personally think the number of tigers has doubled in the last decade and that the area populated by tigers has become much larger," said Li, 60.
But in recent years, China has caught up and might even be moving ahead in creating tiger-friendly habitat, Li said.
Here in Jilin province, the Forestry Ministry has designated a wildlife preserve containing 108,700 acres of spruce, pine and larch forest, the favorite habitat of the tiger.
We are always in groups of two or three so there is somebody to scare off the tiger," said Qi Shuyan, 46, who works on the same ranch in Jintang as Liu Xiangqing.
Li, the tiger expert, says attacks are relatively rare here because of Chinese respect for the tiger, revered by many as a mountain god.
In a lifetime of herding, Liu Xiangqing had never seen cows so scared.

A decade-long effort to restore its natural home by banning logging, hunting and trapping is bringing it back.
The latter country began tiger-protection efforts in the 1940s and has the largest population of Siberian tigers, between 400 and 900, according to the World Wildlife Fund.
Siberian tigers weigh as much as 675 pounds.
"The area populated by tigers has become much larger," Li said.
Some Chinese people still buy illegal body parts of tigers for traditional medicine.
But one morning last June, they were scattered through the pine scrub, anxiously pacing.

The conservative social media star from Georgia is enlisting fellow teenagers across the country to help Texas Senator Ted Cruz win the Republican presidential nomination.
His mission: persuade high schoolers to spread the gospel of Cruz to eligible voters who care about them \u2014 and in some cases, take care of them.
When former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani questioned how much President Barack Obama loves America, Pearson defended Giuliani with a YouTube video.
Pearson said politics first piqued his interest in 2008, when his first-grade class held a mock presidential election.
"Government that governs least governs best," Pearson said.
"Conservatism resonates with me because I\'ve seen firsthand the damaging effects big government can have on our America and to be quite frank, I don\'t like it one bit," citing his experience with Common Core education standards.
Pearson said he plans to join the local school board as soon as he graduates from high school, and then work behind the scenes in politics after college before he runs for office.
Before his ascent to stardom, Pearson volunteered for local Republicans Senator David Perdue, Representative Rick Allen and Governor Nathan Deal in 2014.
Now, Pearson is tapping into his fan base for Cruz, seeking out other politically minded youngsters to build a national network.
Pearson said Cruz has a natural appeal to teens: He drives elders crazy.
He\'s really someone who\'s led on issues and stood up to everyone," said Pearson, comparing Cruz to current Republican front-runner Donald Trump.
After meeting Cruz at a state party convention, Pearson contacted David Sawyer, a regional director for the Cruz campaign, about getting involved.
The campaign made sure Pearson and his family were comfortable with the role and then welcomed him on board, Tyler said.
Pearson predicted that 17-year-olds soon eligible to vote could be more reliable than college students in Iowa, who might be more concerned with exams than absentee ballots.
Conservative news websites jumped on it and applauded the teenager who stood up to the president.
And those teens can then lean on the eligible voters they interact with every day.
They want someone who has walked the walk," said Cruz, recounting his 2013 fight against increasing the federal government\'s borrowing limit, which he ultimately lost.

The small school in Chicago became the first U.S. university to offer scholarships for video gaming when it launched its eSports program this fall.
The teams are a part of the athletics department at Robert Morris, which has about 2,500 students at its Chicago campus and about 6,000 across several campuses in Illinois.
The best professional gamers earn six figures through sponsorship deals and competition winnings.
"We\'re definitely taking it seriously.
Each student normally pays more than $30,000 per year to study and live at Robert Morris.
They are outfitted with official sweatshirts and jackets.
They practice under the supervision of one head coach and four assistant coaches.
It was his idea to offer scholarships to attract talented gamers to the school.
The increasing popularity of eSports might surprise people who are unfamiliar with the world of competitive gaming.
With these scholarships in mind, some parents might want to think twice before telling their kids to turn off the computer.

The lights flicker on above the tennis courts at DeForest Park in Long Beach, Calif., but the nets have disappeared.
When Sanchez moved to a side of town where more Latinos lived, he fell in love with soccer.
So, several years ago, Sanchez and a group of friends began to turn the tennis courts into miniaturized, rock-hard soccer courts.
They did what Brazilians and other Latin Americans started doing nearly a century ago: they turned any flat, open space, from basketball gyms to rooftops, into a soccer field.
There is not any open space in city neighborhoods to build more.
A normal soccer field would cost 10 times as much.
Last year, the U.S. Soccer Federation began requiring some of its academy teams to play futsal during the off-season.
Indoor soccer fields typically resemble a hockey rink, and kicks that bounce off surrounding walls are legal.
County officials said it was necessary to add futsal courts.
Three of the four tennis courts at DeForest Park were made into futsal courts last summer.

As older people are more likely to be on the electoral roll, there has been a huge drive to get younger people engaged in the Yes campaign.
Interest in the referendum is sky high.
Among the electorate are 124,000 16- and 17-year-olds who will be voting for the first time.
However, with polls suggesting that as many as 40 percent of families are divided over the referendum \u2014 and with at least 20 percent saying the debate has led to heated family arguments \u2014 the art of friendly persuasion has not exactly been easy.
The Better Together camp says older voters have a wealth of experience to impart on younger ones.

Amid the soothing strains of a harp, guests promenaded into the Executive Mansion, pausing before a clutch of media before making their way to a receiving line and into the East Room, where waiters in tuxedos regaled them with an eight-course meal served on gold-rimmed china.
Just like last year, President Barack Obama somehow was snubbed ("Usually at a state dinner, I get invited," he told the kids), but made a surprise appearance anyway.
He went on to say while in childhood, his family boiled down vegetables until they would get "all soft and mushy, and nobody wanted to eat a pea or a Brussels sprout because they tasted horrible because they were all mush.
"It was crazy," the boy said.
The ersatz state dinner, which featured the George W. Bush china, had fun and frivolous touches, including tablecloths featuring awning stripes in summery colors and centerpieces crafted with brightly colored peppers.

But in rural Kern County, Calif., David Cain is working to win the stomachs and wallets of U.S. grocery shoppers.
Ordinary grapes like the red Flame Seedless can cost as little as 88 cents a pound.
California is now churning out other sweet inventions, including apriums (a pluot but with more apricot), peacharines (peach and nectarine) and cherums (cherry and plum).
Cain got his start in the 1970s as a researcher with the USDA developing new varieties of table grapes and seedless raisins in Fresno, Calif. Then, most fruit breeding was done by the government or universities that could afford the time-consuming and expensive work.
He jumped to the private sector in 1987, just as U.S. grape consumption was exploding, thanks to new seedless varieties developed in California.
Cain helped start International Fruit Genetics in 2001.
A few months later at a trade event he tasted the grape that has obsessed him ever since.
But the cotton candy flavor transported Cain to a carnival or county fair.
A Bakersfield grower is set to harvest the first large crop this month.
"We\'re competing against candy bars and cookies," said Cain, 62, a former scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture who now heads research at privately owned International Fruit Genetics in Bakersfield, Calif.
In an intensely competitive marketplace, breeding and branding have become almost as valuable to farmers as sun and soil.
Producers are constantly tinkering, hoping to come up with the next Cuties Clementine orange or Honeycrisp apple \u2014 distinct products that stand out in the crowded fruit aisle.
"People are looking for more flavor," said Mark Carroll, senior director for produce and floral at Gelson\'s Markets, which will carry the Cotton Candy grape.
Purple-hued Funny Fingers are long and thin like chili peppers.
Ordinary grapes like the red Flame Seedless can cost as little as 88 cents a pound.

That variety was developed by the USDA and is known for its crisp texture and juiciness.
A variety named Sweet Sapphire come as round and fat as D batteries.
"You would have to eat about 100 grapes to consume the same amount of calories in a candy bar," said David Heber, director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition.
He thinks its signature flavor has a chance to hook consumers like nothing before.

Before it closed in February, only about 9,000 people applied for the program that let them register as foreigners and become naturalized citizens.
"The main reason these people are leaving is because they don\'t want to endure a deportation and lose the meager belongings they\'ve earned after many years and much sacrifice," he said.
Foreigners seeking regularization complained of difficulties such as a requirement to find seven neighbors to vouch they were living in the country before October 2011.
"It\'s complicated, you spend a lot of money and you don\'t get your papers," Miguelle Saint Juste, a construction worker, said while loading suitcases and a TV onto a bus to return to Haiti with his wife and three daughters.
"We\'re arriving with nothing," he said while boarding a truck in the border town of Ouanaminthe with two of his children and headed toward the capital of Port-au-Prince.
There were delays and high fees for birth certificates and other documents from the poorly functioning Haitian government.
Paul said 21 migrants, including eight children, were whisked across the border on a 15-hour journey without a break to eat or drink \u2014 an allegation the Dominican government denied.
Nearly 290,000 of the estimated 524,000 migrants in the country \u2014 the majority of them Haitians \u2014 applied by the June 17 deadline.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared the canal a Superfund site in 2010 because of all this coal tar and the agency plans to dredge the hundreds of thousands of tons of muck that line the bottom of the canal, and then incinerate it, by 2022.
Swain says the water tasted like a slightly turgid mix of mud, excrement, sand, detergent, gasoline and, surprisingly, grass, perhaps a bit of the algae that gives the water its murky green hue.
He describes the Charles as the worst in terms of raw sewage, surpassing even the Gowanus despite its fetid reputation.
"I\'ll jump in if you\'ll jump in," calls out one onlooker to her friend across the 30-meter-wide waterway on a warehouse rooftop.
"We deserve a Gowanus Canal that sparkles like a jewel," Swain says.
Before plunging into the foul smelling Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, New York, recently, Christopher Swain donned special swimwear: a yellow-and-black dry suit, flippers, thick black gloves, a green swimming cap with "#hope" scrawled on it in black marker, goggles and ear plugs \u2014 plus a whole lot of water-repelling gel on his neck and face.
"I\'ll jump in if you\'ll jump in," one onlooker called out to her friend across the 32-yard-wide waterway on a warehouse rooftop.
Even a drizzle will flood the canal with new sewage, thanks to all those outflow pipes.
"It\'s just like swimming through a dirty diaper," he proclaims.
Cement trucks and other heavy vehicles shook the bridges as Swain swam underneath and a bulldozer dumped gravel into one of the several cement plants that line the canal.
Before it was used as an industrial dumping ground in 1848, the canal was a meandering tidal stream in a swamp.
The agency plans to dredge up the hundreds of thousands of tons of muck lining the bottom of the canal, and then incinerate it, by 2022.
Swain said that he could not even see his gloved hands at the ends of his arms when swimming, especially since he kept kicking the bottom and stirring up whatever lurks down there, including toxic chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and PCBs, as well as heavy metals like lead.
He describes the water as cold and a bit fatty, demonstrating this by smearing it on a metal fence.

The blaze also came within 12 miles of 10 breeding pairs of the subspecies of red fox clinging to survival in the cold, steep slopes above the tree line, raising fears they could have been eaten by coyotes trying to escape the smoke and flames.
Federal wildlife biologists are also concerned about the loss of potential habitat for the Pacific fisher, a member of the weasel family.
That effort has been interrupted by the federal government shutdown, which furloughed federal wildlife biologists.
Preliminary reports from the fire area indicate that the blaze destroyed or damaged dozens of nesting and roosting areas for spotted owls, goshawks and great gray owls \u2014 the largest owl in North America.
On a recent weekday, however, John Keane, a U.S. Forest Service research wildlife ecologist, found a reason for cautious optimism at an expanse of lush meadowlands about 10 miles west of Yosemite where he has studied great gray owls for 15 years.
The meadows edged with 80-foot-tall cedars and ponderosa pines were spared by the fire, which began burning in August.

Two months after the fire raged across one of the wildest areas in the state,  animals continue searching for food and shelter in, as one resident put it, "patches of green, wherever they can find them."
That bear was euthanized by California Department of Fish and Wildlife game wardens.
The fire burned 257,000 acres of High Sierra wilderness straddling the Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park.
Those areas could remain closed for more than a year for safety reasons, federal forest officials said.
Local populations of bears, deer and other common animals are expected to recover.

The Rim Fire last summer did more than just scorch a huge area of Sierra Nevada forests.
The blaze also came within 12 miles of 10 breeding pairs of the red fox.
He is executive director of the nonprofit Central Sierra Environmental Resource Center.
Early reports indicated that the blaze destroyed or damaged dozens of areas where spotted owls, goshawks and great grey owls nest.
On a recent weekday, however, John Keane, a U.S. Forest Service research wildlife ecologist, found a reason for some optimism about 10 miles west of Yosemite.
Peering through binoculars, Keane said, "If I had to put money on it, I\'d say there are still owls here."
Those competing interests were already playing out on fire-stripped slopes.
The Rim Fire last summer did more than just scorch a huge area of Sierra Nevada forests.
Even without that information, federal agencies are coming up with ideas to help protect the animals.
The idea is to save certain species from [extinction](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species).
They stand 2 feet tall and have a 5-foot wingspan.
He said he "visited a great owl nest that had been around for 20 years and it was collapsed.

But Dungan, then 13, was shy and preferred nail polish and Disney princesses to running bases and wearing a batting helmet.
Surrounded by family and friends, who pull up lawn chairs and pack coolers to cheer them on, buddies and players on eight teams compete against each other on four makeshift baseball fields at Briar Patch Park.
The teams, which are more interested in having fun than keeping score, play until the games end at a designated time.
She listened to the way Dungan interacted with her parents and two brothers, then used similar phrasing to invoke a response, she said.
"But when your kid clicks with someone who really cares about them and wants to make them happy \u2026 there is nothing like it.
Giambalvo, now a student at Elmhurst College, said she plans to keep returning to Briar Patch Park in Wheaton each summer for as long as she can to spend time with Dungan, whom she now counts among her closest friends.
Some pairs have been together for several years, returning home from college and even full-time jobs to be back on the field with their old friend.
It spills over to Taylor Swift concerts, trips to the local swimming pool and other activities.

One of the side effects with the treatment for his cancer was loss of hearing.
So he wrote a book called "Peter Learns to Listen," in which he shares his own experience with hearing-loss.
He offers tips to hearing-impaired children: "Make sure to get the right (ear) molds, or they\'ll fall out when you hang upside down in a tree."
Peter has run a 5K race and he plays second base on his Little League team.
It was Christmas Eve 2003 when Dennis and Dawn Zucca learned that their 10-month-old boy had a cancer that attacks the muscles.
"Enjoy him the best you can" their doctors advised, telling the Zuccas that Peter had just two months to live.
Peter was learning to walk again when a lump was discovered in the leg.
The hardest part still, Peter said recently, is "not being able to play the same way."
The Peter Powerhouse Foundation has raised about $65,000, enough to buy 100 wagons for the hospital and a pair of cinema vision goggles that allow children to watch movies during treatment instead of being given medicine to sleep.
But on a recent afternoon, Peter Powerhouse needed some time for fun: "I was thinking we\'d play basketball."
The Philadelphia-area preteen uses what he has gone through to make life easier for others like him.
The cancer was in his pelvis and had spread to his lungs.
Dennis and Dawn Zucca had a choice: Lose the leg, or risk losing the boy.
He has turned his powers to helping others.
Peter certainly understands the troubles of kids with cancer.

Cancer almost killed Peter Zucca before his first birthday.
Stanford researchers have unearthed clues about the formidable brains of some autistic children, suggesting that the diagnosis may signal a different cognitive style, not disability.
This small but important study, the first of its type, "makes us better aware of the unique talents that these people have, which could help them have better academic and professional lives," said postdoctoral scholar Teresa Iuculano, lead author of the study.
They studied 36 youngsters, ages 7 to 12.
On standardized math tests, the children with autism significantly outperformed the others.
While other children counted on their fingers or memorized answers, the autism children broke the problem down into components \u2014 a method called decomposition.
For instance, if asked the sum of 7 plus 4, they would add 7 plus 3, then add 1.
The brain scans of the autistic children revealed an unusual pattern of activity in a part of a brain just below the ears, called the ventral temporal occipital cortex.
"This different brain architecture might even be suitable for certain strong skills to develop, such as problem solving, even though there are things that they may not be good at," said Iuculano.

Autism is usually thought of as a serious developmental problem.
Now, though, new research suggests that autism may not be a disability after all.
The children with autism were found to have superior math skills.
This new understanding may help children with autism have a better experience in school and, later, at work, she said.
Like all those with autism, the children had difficulty talking with people.
But autistic people can also have exceptional skills or talents, known as "savant" abilities.
But the discovery of math talents in such children is particularly significant.
The Stanford researchers admit it is possible that children with autism have greater math skills only because they practice so much.
But the researchers believe there is more to it than that.
They studied 36 youngsters, age 7 to 12.
On standardized math tests, the children with autism did significantly better than the others.
This occurred in a part of a brain just below the ears, called the ventral temporal occipital cortex.
Normally, the ventral temporal occipital cortex is used to interpret visual objects, including faces.
"This different brain architecture might even ... [help] certain strong skills to develop, such as problem-solving, even though there are things that they may not be good at," said Iuculano.

If you thought energy drinks were little more than sugar water, scientists from Mayo Clinic can assure you that they really do pack a punch.
However, they added, the results might be different with another energy drink or a larger group of volunteers.
President Barack Obama on Wednesday called on world leaders meeting at the United Nations to "choose hope over fear" by fighting sectarian conflict and extremism, beginning with the militant group Islamic State (ISIL) in Syria and Iraq but branching out beyond the Middle East.
There can be no reasoning \u2014 no negotiation \u2014 with this brand of evil.
So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death."
Videos posted on social media early Wednesday showed Syrian civilians picking through rubble of destroyed homes, and Syrian activists reported civilian casualties.
It is time for a new compact among the civilized peoples of this world to eradicate war at its most fundamental source: the corruption of young minds by violent ideology."
For we will not succumb to threats; and we will demonstrate that the future belongs to those who build \u2014 not those who destroy."
President Barack Obama on Wednesday called on world leaders meeting at the United Nations to "choose hope over fear" by fighting sectarian conflict and extremism, beginning with the militant group Islamic State (ISIL) in Syria and Iraq but branching out beyond the Middle East.
The militant group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force.
President Barack Obama on Wednesday asked world leaders at the United Nations to "choose hope over fear" and help fight the extremist group Islamic State (ISIL) in Syria and Iraq.
Obama also promised to help stop the outbreak of the Ebola virus devastating West Africa.
But a couple of stalls down, a shopper could find cherries, apricots, and even peaches and nectarines that tasted like midsummer.
For shoppers, it means less salad and more dessert.
And this year has been far warmer than normal.
The higher temperatures have interrupted the tightly orchestrated schedule of planting and harvesting that farmers rely on to ensure a smooth supply of produce throughout the year.
Summer, on the other hand, will be coming early.
The Weisers took advantage of the warm weather to plant their highly sought Ogen and Sugar Cube melons three weeks earlier.
"As soon as we put our best-laid plans on paper, Mother Nature comes along," said Mark McBride of Coastline Family Farms, a major vegetable grower based in the Salinas Valley.

An NFL franchise in London could generate more than $250 million a year for Britain, according to a study released Wednesday.
The prospect of a team being permanently based in London has been growing since the NFL first brought regular-season games to the city in 2007.
An NFL franchise in London could generate more than $250 million a year for Britain, according to a study released Wednesday.
In addition, it warns that U.S. football fans could react negatively to the idea of a Super Bowl in London.
The idea of permanently basing a team in London has been growing since the NFL first brought regular-season games to the city in 2007 as part of its International Series.
If the game started when it was 4 p.m. on the East Coast in the United States, it would mean it was starting at 9 p.m. in London.
The two games held in 2013 generated $52 million for London, the report claims.
A switch to four games a year would bring an additional $42 million in profits, Deloitte estimates, for a total of around $94 million.
If the NFL instead chose to increase the number of International Series games held in London, the city would still benefit greatly.

The National Football League (NFL) may soon have a new football team \u2014 based in London, England.

A switch to four games a year would bring an additional $42 million in profits, Deloitte estimates, for a total of around $94 million.
According to a study released Wednesday, such a team could be very good for the British economy.
If the team hosts eight home games a season, the study predicts, the city could see $165 million in increased profits.
Throughout Britain as a whole, the study concluded that a London team would generate $252 million in profits per season.
In addition, the study says, NFL fans in the United States could be angered by the idea of moving something as American as the Super Bowl overseas.
The two games held in 2013 generated $52 million for London, the study says.

One of the most common excuses for tossing out food is that people "want to eat only the freshest food."
The other widely cited reason is a fear of food poisoning.
The amount of food that goes to waste in the United States has ballooned in recent years.
That is almost 20 percent more food than Americans tossed out in 2000.
The problem is often attributed to the unreasonable standards we have set for foods sold commercially.
"I am above this less-than-ideal apple," however, isn\'t one of them.

What a drag it is, eating kale that is not as crisp as it was when first plucked from the ground.
One of the most common excuses for throwing out food is that people "want to eat only the freshest food."

Taste, the sense that allows us to appreciate the beauty of good food, is something scientists understand fairly well.
And now, scientists believe they have found a sixth basic taste that could profoundly change the way we eat.
If people learn to manipulate the taste of fat correctly, he says, it will allow us to make tons of food taste better by either reproducing the taste of fat or introducing substitutes that successfully mimic it.
And receptors are all over our taste buds \u2014 there are as many as 100 taste receptors on each taste bud.
How we experience a mouthful of food hinges on how the chemicals in the foods interact with the receptors on our tongues.
To figure out that fat could be another of the basic tastes, Mattes conducted two experiments.
In the first, more than 100 participants were given isolated solutions that had one of six different tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami and fatty.
"We\'re pretty sure that they did that because bitterness, umami-ness and fattiness, when isolated, can be pretty strange," said Mattes.
The combination of those two things is what\'s important."
Taste, the sense that allows us to appreciate the beauty of good food, is something scientists understand fairly well.
For hundreds of years, scientists have known about four basic tastes: sour, sweet, salty and bitter.
And now, scientists believe they have found a sixth basic taste that could profoundly change the way we eat.
And receptors are all over our taste buds \u2014 there are as many as 100 taste receptors on each taste bud.
In another experiment, they gave participants solutions containing only the three "bad" or "strange" tastes, and the participants easily divided the tastes into three groups.
The fat taste that Mattes is talking about is hidden in a bite of steak or a dollop of olive oil \u2014 just as umami is hidden in a bite of anchovy.
Taste, the sense that allows us to appreciate the beauty of good food, is something scientists understand fairly well.
The sensation we feel when eating a piece of cake, chewing on a hamburger or taking the first bite of a piping hot piece of pizza is triggered when chemicals in our food interact with receptors in our mouths and send messages to our brains.
For hundreds of years, scientists believed there were four basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty and bitter.
Now scientists believe they have found a sixth basic taste that could profoundly change the way we eat.
In a new study, researchers found evidence that fat actually interacts with human taste buds in a way similar to the five basic tastes.
It led many scientists to believe that it could change the way we perceive and experience food, in the same way that tastes such as sweet and sour do.
Taste is the sense that lets us appreciate the beauty of good food.
It is something that scientists already understand fairly well.

Richard Mattes is a professor and a scientist.
The same goes for food and flavor.
Mattes wanted to see if fat could be another primary taste.
The tastes were sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami and fatty.
From this, the scientists learned that fat has its own taste.
Then last week, violent attacks on immigrant shopkeepers in Durban townships exploded and have continued since.
Violence spread in central Durban on Tuesday, after looters attacked shops owned by immigrants, some of whom armed themselves with machetes and knives.
On Friday, in the worst attack in the latest unrest, two Ethiopian brothers in Umlazi township near Durban were locked in their small shop in a shipping container, which had been set alight by a mob.
Mobs looted shops Wednesday in the KwaZulu-Natal city of Pietermaritzburg, and the African Diaspora Forum reported a threat to firebomb a building in the town of Mthatha, in the Eastern Cape, that houses many foreign-owned shops.
Bereje Fana, spokesman for the Ethiopian Community Association, said the organization had been pressing South African authorities to take attacks on immigrants more seriously and to protect them, their homes and businesses.
It began after the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, told his followers last month that foreigners in South Africa should pack up and leave.
Then last week, violent attacks on immigrant shopkeepers in Durban townships exploded and have continued since.
Dozens of immigrants in Johannesburg and other cities shuttered their shops Wednesday as anonymous cellphone text messages warned that Zulu people were coming to kill immigrants in neighborhoods with large migrant populations.
Another referred to an attack that "will be more destructive than ever before," and warned immigrants to stay indoors.
In January, more than 120 foreign-owned shops were looted, often while police stood by.
There were similar mass attacks on immigrant businesses in May, June and September.
It began after the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, told his followers last month that foreigners in South Africa should pack up and leave.
In 2008, 62 people were killed in attacks on immigrants in townships around Johannesburg.
Six people were killed in the violence.

The African Diaspora Forum also reported a threat to firebomb a building in the town of Mthatha, in the Eastern Cape, that houses many foreign-owned shops.
The leaders of groups representing South African owners of small cafes and shops have been blamed for stirring inflammatory sentiment in the past.
They have accused foreign shopkeepers of flooding the market with cheap, substandard goods and destroying South African jobs and businesses.
Some of the immigrants had armed themselves with machetes and knives.
Immigrant shopkeepers have been under attack in parts of South Africa.
He said that foreigners were "taking over the country" in a "ticking time bomb."
One message referred to an attack that "will be more destructive than ever before," and warned immigrants to stay indoors.
Some 2,400 people fled their homes in the Durban violence this past week.
They have been living in temporary camps.
Organizations representing immigrants in South Africa say that smaller attacks in small towns occur almost weekly.
CVS Caremark will become the first national pharmacy company to stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products.
"Put simply, the sale of tobacco products is inconsistent with our purpose."
But sales at pharmacies have been increasing, even as overall cigarette sales have declined.
Public health advocates praised the CVS decision.
She is president and chief executive officer of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
Since then, the nation has dramatically cut smoking rates for adults from 42 percent in 1965 to just 19 percent in 2011, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"It is a hard habit to break," said Robin Koval, president and chief executive officer of Legacy, a leading advocate for the prevention of tobacco use.
CVS executives said they hoped the decision would help make tobacco use socially unacceptable.
In June, Starbucks began prohibiting smokers from smoking within a 25 feet of its shops.

"Millions of people around the world are fascinated by Abraham Lincoln," said Stowell, who also is director of the museum and library\'s Center For Digital Initiatives.
And sometimes it appears the author was writing from a seat in a bumpy carriage, said Henrikson, "a history geek."
She recalls transcribing a letter written to Lincoln by a Louisiana teacher who was begging the president for a job up north.
Stowell said they have digitized documents scattered in more than 400 repositories and more than 200 private collections worldwide.
"I\'ve seen a lot of Lincoln signatures," said Weinberg, who has been in the shop since 1971.

He and his co-workers are employing modern technology to make historical Lincoln documents accessible to anyone with a computer.
He noted that streets in Israel are named after Lincoln, who, according to the prime minister, had a desire to visit Jerusalem that went unfulfilled.
"I definitely see digitalization and Internet as a way to reach a young audience," Stowell said.
Digitizing physically preserves these fragile papers and allows people to see them, he said.

Instead, French children \u2013 who, like their parents, already enjoy longer lunch breaks and summer vacations than their counterparts in many other countries \u2013 have to show up for class Monday through Friday.
The Nizards complain that Sacha has lost his bearings, and that their leisurely Tuesday evenings, when the family could go out to dinner or Sacha could watch TV without worrying about class the next morning, have been sabotaged.
This was imposed upon us," said Isabelle Nizard, 41, a dark-haired woman full of indignation and expressive gestures.
Because French students had Wednesdays off, as well as a relatively short school year, educators were forced to pack more hours into each remaining school day in order to achieve an annual amount of instruction time comparable to other developed nations.
Adding Wednesday to the mix is supposed to alleviate that burden, at a time when the declining performance of French students is becoming a source of heavy concern.
Everybody agrees that the day is too compressed and that something needs to be changed," said Peter Gumbel, a professor at Sciences Po university here and the author of a bestselling book on problems in the French education system.
And moms and dads who have artfully arranged their French 35-hour workweeks to spend Wednesdays with their tots feel shafted.
"We have this midweek day off which helps the kids relax, to establish their own rhythm, to stay up a little longer (on Tuesdays) with us," said Eric Nizard, Sacha\'s father.
"The day after, there is no stress, no push in the morning to wake up to go to school."
Businesses have sprung up to cater to the Wednesday whims of middle-class families, offering such get-ahead programs for youngsters as English classes.
Isabelle Nizard helped put together a petition from her affluent neighborhood in the 16th arrondissement demanding that the mayor of Paris scrap the schedule revamp.
By the time they turn 15, nearly 40 percent of French students have had to repeat a grade \u2013 triple the average rate of most industrialized countries.
The new schedule has unleashed protests from teachers and petitions from parents.

More than 15 percent drop out or finish school without a diploma.
Children as young as 6 often remain in class until late in the afternoon, as skies darken and parents get off work.
Instead, the parents group she leads and others across France are now urging members to pull their kids out of school next Wednesday in protest.
The uproar may seem to outsiders like a classic case of French whine.
But officials say it centers on a serious issue.
Because French students had Wednesdays off, as well as a relatively short school year, educators were forced to pack more hours into each remaining school day in order to achieve an annual amount of instruction time equal to other developed nations.
Adding Wednesday to the mix is supposed to lighten that burden, at a time when the declining performance of French students is becoming a source of heavy concern.
When France created universal public education in the late 19th century, the government gave a weekly day off for children to attend religious instruction by the Roman Catholic Church.
But that personal calm has been challenged by public criticism.

RIS \u2013 Parents like Eric and Isabelle Nizard are angry over a social experiment being conducted on their 9-year-old son, Sacha.
It was a traditional oasis in the middle of the week for elementary school students.
Their Tuesday evenings have been sabotaged.
The new schedule has sparked protests from teachers and letters from parents.
Businesses have sprung up to serve the Wednesday desires of middle-class families, offering get-ahead programs for kids like English classes.
Isabelle helped put together a letter signed by the people in her rich neighborhood demanding that the mayor of Paris stop the new schedule.
By the time they turn 15, nearly 40 percent of French students have had to repeat a grade.
The Nizards complain that Sacha feels a bit lost.

McGraw-Hill Education sought to redress these implied untruths in a Facebook announcement Friday.
While the geography program "meets the learning objectives of the course," the publishing company\'s statement said, a close review of the content revealed that "our language in that caption did not adequately convey that Africans were both forced into migration and to labor against their will as slaves."
They can send out a supplement.
Referencing her use of #BlackLivesMatter on Facebook, Dean-Burren added, "Minimizing slavery in any way is a way of saying those black lives, those black bodies, that black pain didn\'t matter enough to give it a full description."
McGraw-Hill was one of a handful of textbook providers that came under fire after the Texas State Board of Education adopted new standards for its social studies curriculum in 2010 \u2014 a policy that educators derided for interfering with accurate history instruction.
Most of the textbooks found to be problematic were nevertheless approved.
In a section titled "Patterns of Immigration," a speech bubble pointing to the continent of Africa read: "The Atlantic Slave Trade between the 1500s and 1800s brought millions of workers from Africa to the southern United States to work on agricultural plantations."
Referencing her use of #BlackLivesMatter on Facebook, Dean-Burren added, "Minimizing slavery in any way is a way of saying those black lives, those black bodies, that black pain didn\'t matter enough to give it a full description."
The educational publisher has been criticized for its Texas materials before.
"It\'s kind of like teaching physics and stopping at Newton without bringing in Einstein," said Countryman, who reviewed some of the Texas books for this school year.
"Mom," he said, "you told me to call you when I realized I could change the world."
Mothers of teenagers are used to getting frustrating text messages from the children.
However, it went on to say, a close review revealed that "our language in that caption did not adequately convey that Africans were both forced into migration and to labor against their will as slaves."
Dean-Burren added, "Minimizing slavery in any way is a way of saying those black lives, those black bodies, that black pain didn\'t matter enough to give it a full description."
Many educators said the standards interfered with teaching history accurately.
While the changes were made only to books sold in Texas, some feared that school districts in other states would use the textbooks.

Jeramey Winfield had imagined himself working in downtown Chicago, taking the train to work and contributing to his profession.
I wanted to give her some relief," said Winfield, who is the first in his family to go to college.
Yet, more than a year after graduating in media studies from Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire, Winfield still does not have a full-time job.
In fact, he said, he has rarely been called back for an interview.
They are having a harder time than whites finding a job, are more likely to be in a job that does not require a college degree and are being paid less than white workers with the same experience.
Even African-Americans who study science, technology, engineering and math \u2014 majors that are winners in the job market \u2014 have had a hard time finding work, said John Schmitt.
The senior economist with the Center for Economic and Policy Research co-authored the new report, "A College Degree is No Guarantee."
In many cases, like Winfield, these graduates were the first in their family to attend college.
That can make their search for work all the more urgent, and their failure to find it a greater burden.
Among recent black graduates ages 22 to 27, the jobless rate in 2013 was 12.4 percent compared with 5.6 percent for whites.
"Jeramey is just a wonderful person who made our campus a better place," said the college\'s president, Tom Galligan, who became friends with Winfield while he was on campus.

In addition, schools will no longer be automatically punished for low average student test scores.
They said it was unfair to teachers whose students were less prepared, perhaps because they came from poor homes.\xa0 In addition, schools were punished if too many of their students got low test scores.
As a result, many schools began to spend too much time on preparing students for the tests.

While not an advocate for stem cell therapy, as one of the few athletes who have gone public on the treatment he understands why active players approach him about it.
Yet while Bradley is bullish on its potential, he spends a fair amount of time explaining what exactly stem cell therapy does, ostensibly.
But nearly all evidence is anecdotal \u2014 no definitive lab results show it works.
Clinics in various countries in Europe, Australia and Asia offer far more aggressive therapies.
Patients can have stem cells taken out then grown in a laboratory for weeks, producing millions more cells.
He has referred some patients (not Steelers, following team policy) to a practice in the Cayman Islands he considers safe.

"He had a huge passion for nature, such as we should all cherish in our hearts," said Mary Ellen Hannibal, a Bay Area author and Muir devotee.
"Environmentalism, in some ways, has moved beyond John Muir," said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity.
Yet "the conservation movement reflects the legacy of John Muir, and its influence on a certain demographic \u2014 older and white \u2014 and that\'s a problem," Christensen said.
"For many communities of color, nature of great significance isn\'t out there in distant charismatic Sierra peaks; it\'s in urban parks, in local mountains and along local rivers \u2014 and under their fingertips in the stuff they grow in their own backyards," he said.
Nature exists in many forms, they say.
John Muir is the godfather of environmentalism, the movement to protect nature.

One of the worst-hit states last winter was Massachusetts, which was struck by 31 storms, two of which brought among the heaviest snowfalls on record.
However, they said, a winter storm can be very different once it hits the ground.
Nelson said states are more proactive than in the past, when they would say, "It started snowing, I plowed and put my salt on the road."
This alerts transportation supervisors to changing conditions and helps them get a better handle on the use of materials, trucks and overtime.
The technology takes the data and uses algorithms to come up with recommendations on which chemicals to spread, how much to apply, and how frequently to plow.
The new strategy is to use just the amount needed to do the job and no more.
Regardless of who foots the bill, the price tag would be enormous.

The spirited sport known as parkour that treats the world as one big obstacle course is gaining traction outside of the urban enthusiasts whose YouTube-worthy acrobatics spread its popularity.
Parkour, developed in France in the 1980s, borrows elements from martial arts, gymnastics, rock climbing and other athletic fields to enable participants to turn obstacles like park benches, trees, guardrails, and buildings into tools they can use to nimbly propel themselves forward.
Beginners who want to hit the ground running \u2014 but maybe not by running up a construction crane, James Bond-style \u2014 have the option of classes like those offered by London-Based Parkour Generations, a business with affiliates in California, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin, and that offers instruction in several countries including Thailand, Singapore and Brazil.
Classes include a warm-up, technical drills to learn the basics of safety and games to teach and reinforce parkour techniques.
At the Brookline class, instructors set up metal bars they called scaffolding and vault boxes in the gym, teaching students how to walk on or hurtle over balance beams and lift, leap or weave their way through whatever else was in their path.

After China blocked access to the site in 2006, Xiao made plans for a Chinese-language site, which he launched in 2011.
China blocked that site as well, but Xiao said his team uses a variety of methods to make China Digital Times accessible in China.
But Xiao and China Digital Times have provided a real service, she said, through their decadelong tracking of the "Minitrue" directives.
"But they know they are in trouble.
It would be taken down immediately," said Xiao Qiang, chief editor of China Digital Times and an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
"But outside the Great Firewall you can do that.

A public elementary school decided in 2011 to require students to wear a uniform with the school\'s motto, "Tomorrow\'s Leaders," emblazoned in small letters on the shirts around a gopher, the campus mascot.
The panel said the words "Tomorrow\'s Leaders" potentially violated students\' right to free speech and the uniform policy must go unless the school district can justify it under a legal standard that is difficult to meet.
The "policy compels speech because it mandates the written motto, \'Tomorrow\'s Leaders,\' on the uniform shirts," wrote Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen, an Obama appointee, who was joined by two judges selected by Republican presidents.
"The exemption explicitly favors the uniforms of the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts over all other uniforms ... and favors the uniforms of \'nationally recognized\' youth organizations over those of locally or regionally recognized youth organizations," the court said.
Siding with the mother were a student organization and a national legal foundation that advocates for religious liberty.
In ruling for the mother, the 9th Circuit cited a 1977 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down a New Hampshire law requiring motorists to display license plates embossed with the state motto, "Live Free or Die."
Volokh said the elementary school could still encourage students to wear the uniform but also would have to permit similar attire without the motto and the uniforms of other groups in addition to the Scouts.

Since then, Pooh and his friends have become the subject of countless television shows and movies and are found in stuffed animal collections everywhere.
He joked at the time that since he was an adult, it was time to give up his childhood companion.
The Times once again made the case for the return of Pooh.
The Times added: "It is obvious then that Winnie-the-Pooh, whatever else he is, is not an American."
"The librarians themselves leave Winnie a pot of honey and a red balloon every year on his birthday \u2014 he is a cherished part of everyday life at (the library)," she explained.
Pooh has lived at the library ever since.
Winnie-the-Pooh is just a stuffed animal, after all.

Fleeing rural poverty in Kentucky, Rose Will Monroe piled her son and daughter into a bus in 1942, not long after her husband was killed in a car wreck.
Monroe was just one of 6 million American women who entered the workforce during World War II, about half of them in the defense industries.
Through a confluence of circumstances, Monroe became "Rosie the Riveter," the iconic image of the tough, hardworking American woman who helped win the war.
The symbol was first popularized by a song, and "Rosie" soon came to represent all women working in defense.
"There were quite a few faces of Rosie," said Croston, who spoke at Lockheed Martin in honor of Women\'s History Month.
Monroe\'s story is inspiring for today\'s "Rosies" at Lockheed Martin, said Gayle Roland, a senior procurement manager.

Fort Worth is a long way from Ypsilanti, where Monroe and her co-workers built 8,685 bombers, or one about every 56 minutes during the war.
In 1944, she was discovered by the actor Walter Pidgeon, who visited Willow Run to shoot footage.
When he learned that there really was a riveter named Rose on the job, he made her a showpiece of his films.
"They were so willing to pitch in and help.
Among them are Lorraine Martin, the F-35 program manager in Fort Worth, and Janet Nash, vice president for F-35 production.

Fifty years ago, Colombia shipped its first batch of fresh-cut flowers to Miami ($20,000 worth of carnations by some accounts) and jump-started a billion-dollar industry.
In a handful of decades, flowers in the United States went from being high-end luxury goods sold only at specialized shops to being ubiquitous \u2014 from grocery stores to gas stations to traffic lights.
Inspired by Wells\' work, Cheever wrote his master\'s thesis in 1967, titled "Bogota, Colombia, as a Cut-Flower Exporter for World Markets."
And he said, \'Why don\'t we get into that business.\'"
Among that group was a Colorado State University student named David Cheever.
In 1969, he and two brothers started growing carnations on a 2.5-acre plot.
"They work by the square foot," he said of outlets such as Costco and Walmart.
Things began to take off in the early 1970s when Weston, with Flores Colombianas, established El Dorado Trading Company in Miami.
"After that, flowers were going straight into refrigeration and we had sales girls who could talk to all of the cities in the United States," he said.
Now, there are an estimated 350 flower growers in Colombia who employ 130,000 workers.
Fifty years ago, Colombia shipped its first batch of fresh-cut flowers to Miami and jump-started a billion-dollar industry.
"He saw that Washington was full, full of socialites and all they did was go to parties and take each other presents, which were often flowers \u2014 and he said, \'Why don\'t we get into that business.\'"
In 1961, President John F. Kennedy launched the Alliance for Progress, which aimed to create a better relationship between the United States and its Latin America neighbors.
"We\'re in a position where people (in the United States) will not only want flowers for Valentine\'s Day but as a year-round consumer good," he said.
They now can be bought everywhere from grocery stores to gas stations to street corners.
Since then, Colombian flowers have grown into a billion dollar industry.
The future looks even brighter, according to Colombian Agriculture Minister Aurelio Iragorri.
Soon, many people in the U.S. "will not only want flowers for Valentine\'s Day but as a year-round consumer good," he said.
Campuses, said University of California President Janet Napolitano, have "historically been places where social issues in the United States are raised and where many voices are heard."

But amid this looting of antiquity, there is at least one heartwarming story.
Humbaba emerges, not as a barbarian ogre, and but as a foreign ruler entertained with exotic music at court in the manner of Babylonian kings.
The story was only rediscovered by European philologists in the 19th century, largely by accident.
A museum in northern Iraq not only rescued a trove of artifacts from smugglers, but in the process of preserving heritage, discovered something new.
The legend tells of the travails of Gilgamesh, the great king of Uruk, who journeys with his friend Enkidu, a semi-divine wild man, into the Cedar Forest to defeat the ogre Humbaba.

Among them are the arrogance of a hero, the fear of mortality and even a great flood, navigated by a voyager on an ark.
The chatter of monkeys, chorus of cicada and squawking of many kinds of birds created a symphony that entertained Humbaba daily.
There is a curiously modern wrinkle, as George explained: "Gilgamesh and Enkidu cut down the cedar to take home to Babylonia," George said.

All told, estimates of annual deaths from diarrhea, the majority of them caused by feces-contaminated water, range as high as 1.5 million.
"That\'s very, very expensive," said Doulaye Kone, an environmental engineer who grew up in a village in Africa\'s Ivory Coast and now works at the Gates Foundation.
Hoffmann and his students are preparing to fine-tune the prototype and get it ready for field testing in India, set to begin later this year.
Last year, American Standard donated more than 500,000 of the devices to organizations in Bangladesh, spokeswoman Nora DePalma said.
The firm now is working in Kenya on an effort, also supported by the Gates Foundation, to develop a similarly simple device for areas that lack abundant water, DePalma said.
The Caltech toilet \u2014 with its solar panel, electrochemical reactor and fuel cell battery \u2014 also has been criticized as being too complicated.
Hoffmann, for his part, is convinced technology can help solve sanitation problems where other approaches, he said, have had little success.
Another 700 million use unhygienic facilities such as "hanging latrines" that dump directly into streams, or buckets that may simply be emptied in the streets.

Under the federal Americans With Disabilities Act, state and local governments, businesses and nonprofit organizations that serve the public generally must allow service animals to accompany those with disabilities in all areas of the facility where the public is normally allowed to go.
Some advocates, for instance, are concerned that doing so may put an unreasonable burden on those with disabilities to "prove" their dog is legitimate.
The dog also opens and shuts doors, retrieves the phone, picks up objects she drops and helps open the refrigerator and cabinets.
But while some states have laws against residents pretending to have a legally protected disability in order to gain access for their dog, most do not.
A search of eBay under "service dog patches," for instance, reveals more than 22,000 sellers.
Public confusion, legal loopholes and shady Internet businesses have led to an "epidemic" of fake service-dog certificates, vests and harnesses for use on ordinary pets.
And some say that fact is being exploited.
"There\'s no penalty for people in Florida who fraudulently claim their dog is a service animal," said Paul Edwards of Miami, president of the Florida Council of the Blind.
"There are some of us who feel it isn\'t unreasonable to ask folks to carry identification for dogs that shows them to be a trained service animal \u2014 and most legitimate service-dog organizations do issue those.
Somebody will take Fluffy with them into a restaurant, and the dog will bark or snap at someone or poop on the floor.
"There will be a time when the public is going to reach critical mass regarding all of the alleged service dogs out there, and we will suffer for it."

In 2011, the Department of Justice said dogs are the only legal assistance animals.
Before the Rev.', u'Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech to hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Washington, D.C., in 1963, he fine-tuned his civil rights message before a much smaller audience in North Carolina.
He also referred to "the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners," saying he dreamed they would "meet at the table of brotherhood."
He sent emails and made calls until he eventually heard back in the fall of 2013 from the Braswell Public Library in Rocky Mount, where staff said a box with the recording had mysteriously appeared on a desk one day.

City officials here had long worried that a patient infected with Ebola would eventually appear somewhere in this dense, bustling and chaotic city.
New York and New Jersey announced mandatory quarantines for anyone traveling from three West African nations who has had direct contact with an Ebola patient, including health care workers.
Cleaners wearing protective suits and boots carried blue plastic waste-collecting drums into the apartment to begin the hours-long decontamination process.
Pedro Vanegas, 45, who lives and works across the street from the apartment building, said he was not worried.
"I don\'t like the idea that the country is letting people come and go from these West African countries like normal," said Kenneth Clarke, 45, who lives in the neighborhood.
Juan Perez, 21, whose family lives down the block, said his parents had not sent his younger sister to her school across the street out of fear she could catch Ebola.
Officials at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York also will conduct interviews with other passengers coming from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and decide whether there is reason to impose mandatory quarantines on them.

For most of the past 15 years, Seth Wilner was the go-to guy for any and all questions about growing plants and animals in Sullivan County, New Hampshire.
Today, however, less than 2 percent of Americans farm for a living, and only 17 percent live in rural areas.

Nineteen firefighters died Sunday while battling a fast-moving wildfire northwest of Phoenix, the most firefighters to die fighting a wildland blaze since 1933.
Skurja confirmed that 19 members of the 20-person crew had died.
The previous highest number of deaths in a fire happened in Colorado on July 6, 1994.
There, at Storm King Mountain near Glenwood Springs, 14 firefighters were trapped when a wind-driven blaze blew up a hill.
A couple dozen firefighters are killed on average each year, he said, but 19 firefighters dying in one fire is a "horrific tragedy."

Lake Mission Viejo is Southern California at its most idyllic and, when it comes to water, its most extravagant.
Now, almost 40 years after first-term Governor Jerry Brown chastised officials for filling the lake "while others use buckets to collect water in their showers," Mission Viejo is under scrutiny again as the state struggles through another relentless drought.
"You have to hand it to them; (a lake) was a fantastic idea.
But today, that water should be available for indoor use, not outdoor recreation," said Stephanie Pincetl, director of the California Center for Sustainable Communities at UCLA.
Today, the lake is part of a "complete, year-round resort" with beaches, parks, clubhouses and a stage that hosts summer concerts.
Mission Viejo, state officials said, may be the largest manufactured lake in the Southland that is solely recreational.
The association that owns and operates the lake is quietly discussing with the local water district ways to use less water while keeping the lake filled.
High-end custom homes along the lake can sell for more than $3 million.
As political pressure mounted, the California Water Board ordered Mission Viejo Company to stop filling the massive hole it had dug for the lake.
A year later, the drought subsided, and the board allowed the company to fill the lake with water from the Colorado River.
The lake is not open to the general public.
They bristle at the suggestion of reducing or changing the lake levels.
According to water conservationist Conner Everts, creating a "giant swimming pool for the few" with a public resource "makes no sense at all."
In a state with a lot of inequality when it comes to water, Mission Viejo stands out for its level of "water abuse," Everts said.
When it comes to water use, however, some say it is also particularly wasteful.
To use it, residents must join the Lake Mission Viejo Association and pay dues of more than $200 annually.
If the drought worsens, state Water Board scientist Max Gomberg said, private lakes could face restrictions as well.
According to water conservationist Conner Everts, creating a "giant swimming pool for the few" with precious publicly owned water "makes no sense at all."

had earned the status of a full-fledged word, though an admittedly odd one.
All the words had a single syllable, and they were typically limited to a low-front vowel, something akin to "ah" or "eh."
(To an English speaker, this tone would sound like a statement of fact: "Huh.")
A low-front vowel in the "ah" or "eh" families involves minimal effort, compared with to a high vowel such as "ee" or a lip-rounder such as "oo."
Just as sharks and dolphins developed the same body plan to thrive in the water even though they\'re from very different lineages, all languages have developed a "Huh?"

Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg announced Tuesday that he plans to eventually donate 99 percent of the Facebook stock owned by him and his wife, Priscilla Chan, shares that are worth about $45 billion today.
They wrote that they did not want to wait to "advance human potential and promote equality for all children."
"I will continue to serve as Facebook\'s CEO for many, many years to come," Zuckerberg wrote, "but these issues are too important to wait until you or we are older to begin this work."
A federal filing shows the Facebook co-founder will start by giving away up to $1 billion a year in Facebook stock for the first three years.
The couple revealed their plans in a lengthy "letter to our daughter" published on Facebook, the social network that Zuckerberg co-founded while a student at Harvard University and that today has 1.5 billion monthly active users worldwide.

He wants to show that other areas have some of the same struggles he sees in California.
John Schulz, the public information officer for Larimer County, said the woman was injured and not able to get out of her house as floodwaters began engulfing it.
Donaghey said it has been difficult to get accurate numbers of the missing because communications have been spotty or nonexistent in some of the hardest-hit areas.
Phone service was restored to some areas so authorities are hopeful they can reach more people.
People assume they will hear from loved ones but become increasingly frantic when days pass and they still have not, he said.
Still, Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith, said things were starting to look up.
He became emotional as he described how he thought the communities would come back from the disaster "inch by inch, mile, by mile, community by community."
John Hickenlooper, appearing on CNN on Sunday morning, expressed hope that many of the missing are simply out of reach of communications, and have "already gotten out or (are) staying with friends."
The tentative death toll from the flooding rose to six as Larimer County law enforcement officials said an 80-year-old woman had probably been killed.

The argument spilled into the spotlight in February and March, oddly because storms finally began hitting the state after a sunny, disappointingly dry December and January.
Grober said the delta needed a good flushing to push out ocean salt from previous dry months.
Pumping did not greatly increase.
So how much water should flow to the ocean and how much should go into the massive state and federal export pumps in the south delta?
Last Friday the state announced it would allow farmers and cities to take 5 percent of their allocation from the State Water Project.
The Bay Institute estimates 60 percent of the water from rain and snow is going to those needs, not into the delta.
In the delta, residents are extremely concerned about their communities as water cutbacks continue, said Janet McCleery of Discovery Bay, a community of about 14,000, west of Stockton in the delta.
In Fresno County, drought and a zero allocation of Northern California river water will mean unemployment rates could climb to 50 percent in some towns, Sheriff Margaret Mims wrote to the state water board.
"This year is a whole new level of crazy," said Ara Azhderian of the San Joaquin &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority, representing many farmers who are forecast to get zero water this year.
Grober said the delta needed a good flushing to push out ocean salt from previous dry months.
"That was the split in February and March.

So how much water should flow to the ocean and how much should go into the massive state and federal export pumps in the south delta?
Mostly, the discussion is about how much river water should be allowed to reach the Pacific Ocean through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta \u2014 an old California argument.
"This is a big one," said Les Grober, assistant deputy director at the State Water Resources Control Board, which decides California water rights.
Nobody disputes the need for the water, but the storms in February and March caused the outflow of water to peak more than three times higher.
Pumping water out of the rivers to farms and cities did not greatly increase.
The fresh water from the rivers must continue to flow into the ocean or salt water from the ocean will flow into the delta.
They feel the multibillion-dollar agriculture industry is being robbed of water.
So how much water should flow to the ocean and how much should go into the south delta?
Environmentalists say the plan is much bigger than river flow through the delta and should include water stored at huge reservoirs.
"There is a clear link between unemployment and public safety, and thus between water shortages and public safety," Mims wrote.
San Joaquin Valley farm groups say too much water has been allowed to escape to the ocean.

Federal recognition is desirable because it makes tribal members and governments eligible for federal budget assistance as well as services such as health care, according to the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).
"We are pleased by the proposed changes; however, we know that there is still a ways to go in the process," said Sue Hall, vice chair of the Snohomish Tribe of Indians, which has fought for more than 30 years to gain federal recognition.
We are not giving up.
The BIA will hold hearings in July for federally recognized tribes and the public to comment on the proposed changes.
More than 200 years after that first contact, the five tribes that now make up the Chinook Indian Nation have a constitution, a tribal council and annual meetings.
"How can you tell people you can\'t do anything Indian, but later, when you go to file, they have to prove from 1851 or 1855 that they have been keeping documents?"

The existing law requires them to show that they have existed continuously from "historical times."
That nation has more documentation from the modern era that goes beyond its oral history of ancestral stories, Elliott said.
Finding records from the late 1800s to the 1930s is especially difficult, she said.
During that time, the U.S. government forcibly removed Indian children from their families and placed them in boarding schools.
The government\'s purpose was to strip them of their Indian culture and "civilize" them.
"But if there is one thing we are, we are stubborn, which is the reason we are still here," she said.
Federally recognized tribes and the public may comment on the proposed changes.
The Chinook Native American tribes greeted Lewis and Clark when the explorers arrived at the Lower Columbia River in 1805.

Even though the Kepler mission has found 3,601 candidate planets, only 246 had been previously confirmed.
The new method researchers used to find and confirm these 715 planets relies on the idea that planets seem to cluster in systems with other planets, rather like our own.
It nearly quadruples the number of confirmed planets found with Kepler (from 246 to 961) and doubles the overall number of confirmed planets to about 1,700.
For example, many of these systems seem to have multiple planets clustered in an orbit smaller than Venus, or even Mercury.
The number of Jupiter-sized worlds, on the other hand, rose by a mere 2 percent.
"Certainly it will have ramifications for any mission that finds planets," Kepler project scientist Steve Howell said of the findings.
"I\'m super excited about this," said Sara Seager, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the work.
Yet before this happened, the spacecraft turned up a trove of strange and wonderful worlds, researchers said \u2014 bringing them ever closer to finding "Earth 2.0."
The researchers have been able to deliver "more than 20 times as many planets as have ever been found and announced at once," said Jack Lissauer, a planetary scientist at NASA\'s Ames Research Center.
The scientists increased the number of confirmed Earth-sized planets by 400 percent, super-Earths (larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune) by 500 percent, and Neptune-sized planets by 200 percent.
Instead Kepler might be picking up drops in light caused by two stars that regularly block each other.
The new method researchers used to find and confirm these 715 planets relies on the idea that planets seem to cluster in systems with other planets.
Two teams of researchers were able to devise a probability-based method that focused on these multiplanet systems.
It resulted in the largest single haul of exoplanets (planets found outside our solar system) since the first one was discovered in the 1990s.
Many exoplanets have also been discovered using another technique, which looks for the gravitational influence of a planet on its star.
No comparable planets are found in our own solar system.
Instead Kepler might be picking up drops in light caused by two stars that regularly block each other.
Nearly 95 percent of the new planets are smaller than Neptune.

Paleontologists working in Morocco have found fossils of a bizarre sea creature that could grow up to 7 feet in length and gathered plankton like a whale.
"It is one of the biggest arthropods that ever existed, far bigger than any arthropod today," said Peter Van Roy, a paleobiologist at Yale University who helped uncover some of the specimens of the extinct animal.
Aegirocassis benmoulae is the most recent of these animals to be found and more than double the size of the biggest of its older known relatives.
He and the Moroccan fossil collector Mohamed Ben Moula, who first discovered these large animals, have found dozens of preserved specimens in the Moroccan desert.
This ancient animal had a set of flaps that ran down the top side of its body for swimming, representing an upper limb, and a set of legs on its belly side, for walking.
Among the other animals they found are more advanced arthropods, a variety of horseshoe crabs, some which look remarkably like modern-day horseshoe crabs, jellyfish relatives, and early starfish and snails.

Paleontologists have found fossils of a bizarre sea creature that are providing an important clue to how arthropods evolved.
Aegirocassis benmoulae is part of an extinct group of animals known as anomalocaridid.
Aegirocassis benmoulae is the latest of these animals to be found and is more than double the size of the biggest of its older known relatives.
Arthropods first showed up in the fossil record about 530 million years ago.
He is a professor at the University of New England in Armidale, Australia, and was not involved in the study.
According to Van Roy, giant storms occasionally caused large mud flows to wash into the ancient sea.
The fossils were so well preserved, they helped the scientists solve a long-standing evolutionary mystery.
Paleontologists thought they could trace the origins of the modern arthropod leg to an arthropod ancestor from the early Cambrian period.

Paleontologists have found fossils of a bizarre sea creature that are providing an important clue to how arthropods evolved.
A paper describing the early arthropod was published Wednesday in the scientific magazine Nature.
They were the largest animals of the Cambrian time period, from 543 million to 490 million years ago.
Long before the dinosaurs, a giant sea creature was one of the largest living beings on Earth.
Paleontologists and paleobiologists study fossils of ancient creatures to see how they evolved.
Now extinct, they were the largest animals of the Cambrian time period, about 543 million to 490 million years ago.
However, the growths on the newly discovered sea creature were shaped differently.
Van Roy said the huge sea creatures may have come together to molt \u2014 shed their shells as they grew \u2014 or may have lived together in a group.
This is because soft tissues like skin and muscles decay so rapidly after death, explained John Paterson.
There are also jellyfish relatives, and early starfish and snails.
The pairing was indicative of the wildly successful union of what once were polar-opposite institutions, the stodgy, European-dominated IOC and the rebellious, U.S. extreme-sport community.
While the Olympics provide snowboarders and freestyle skiers with an international showcase, the new sports have added youthful vitality and millions of new TV viewers to Games that were growing stale.
The Winter Games as founder Baron de Coubertin conceived them and broadcast pioneer Roone Arledge presented them for so long have been changed dramatically and probably forever by the inclusion of these sports, beginning with freestyle skiing in 1992.
So too is a younger TV audience that once spurned the Games.
Finally, in a burst of revised thinking between 1992 and 2010, the IOC added short-track speedskating and such freestyle-skiing and snowboarding disciplines as moguls, aerials, slopestyle, and half-pipe.
"At the same time, we have to remain relevant and make sure that we capture a new audience as well.
"They had little understanding of the sport," recalled Bodensteiner, "but we showed them how visually appealing it was and, maybe more importantly, how it could be picked up even in nations like Great Britain or Australia that don\'t have big mountains or big resorts.
Loud rock music, an edgy venue announcer, rebellious attitudes \u2014 all are indicative of the changes.
And so far in 2014, though they still have a week to run, the same is true at the Sochi Games.

It appears California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s.
Scientists have long noticed that tropical ecosystems are rich with different kinds of animal species whereas ecosystems in colder regions have far less diversity.
Researchers compared eight, species-rich mammalian orders.
Those eight orders or groups of different mammals with certain characteristics make up 92 percent of all mammals living on Earth.
They went on to explain that their vision of mammalian evolution on a large scale "continues to change drastically as new data are compiled and new methods are developed."
There are more than 4,000 different species of mammals.
They show that the tropics have been a major source of biodiversity for the cooler regions of the planet with little weather change.
Scientists have long noticed that tropical ecosystems are rich with different kinds of animal species.
The theories attempt to explain species movement from tropical areas of the Earth toward polar regions.
This may be because these adorable-eared animals actually first developed in the temperate regions.
So researchers from around the world decided to compare different types of mammals.
The area called the tropics does not have seasons like fall and spring.

The researchers found that the two groups did a roughly equal job at predicting how time was passing during the experiment.
But this may not be the whole explanation for the return-trip effect.
In a 2011 study, psychologists asked a group of cyclists to ride to a fair.
Humans are impressive creatures, but we are not that great at estimating time.
Our sense of how much time is passing often depends on what is going on in our lives, what we have going on in our day or even on our mood.
When you go somewhere new and come back again, it often seems that the trip back took less time than the trip there.
Some of the people in both groups were asked to tell the researchers every time they thought three minutes had passed.
The study suggests that "the return-trip effect" has something to do with memory and reflection.
However, when you are distracted by other, more interesting things, time passes more quickly.
Psychologists also have another theory.
On the way there, you do not know the route, but on the way back, you recognize sites you saw before and that makes the trip go by faster.
Some research has found that people can experience the effect even when they are in unfamiliar territory.
They then split the group in half after they arrived.
One group rode home on the same road that they bicycled in on.
In the end, the "return-trip effect" may be a combination of all of these things.
Humans are impressive creatures, but we are not that great at estimating time.
Some of the people in both groups were asked to tell the researchers every time they thought three minutes had passed.
The second group watched a cameraman take two different trips.
The other group took a different route, but it was exactly the same distance back as the first group.

Scientists also have another theory.
Yet people do not experience the "return-trip effect" on rides they take often, like to jobs.
This is because they already know the route that they take and have a good idea of how long the journey will be.
In a 2011 study, scientists asked people to bicycle to a fair.
Then they split the group in half after they arrived.
The other group took a different route, but it was exactly the same distance to go back as the first group.
This study decided that people are often too positive on their first journey, and expect it to be shorter than it really is.
Humans are advanced creatures, but we are not so good at measuring time.

Documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden suggest that spy agencies have a powerful ally in "Angry Birds" and a host of other apps installed on smartphones across the globe.
The size and scope of the program aren\'t publicly known, but the reports suggest that U.S. and British intelligence easily get routine access to data generated by apps such as the "Angry Birds" game franchise or the Google Maps navigation service.
The NSA did not directly comment on the reports but said in a statement Monday that the communications of those who were not "valid foreign intelligence targets" were not of interest to the spy agency.
"We collect only those communications that we are authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes \u2014 regardless of the technical means used by the targets."

The restaurant operated from 1926 to 1997, said his daughter, Karen Yee of Bethel Park.
In the 1920s, Yee said, it was common for Chinese families to send one son abroad to earn money to send back to China, and her father took on that role.
Only later did he add Cantonese dishes, egg rolls and other menu items.
The two went ahead with the marriage after Fung, who followed Confucian teachings, agreed to let the children be raised Catholic.
Yee and her twin sister were born during the Depression, and were followed over the years by two brothers and a sister.
One result of the exclusion act was that Chinese-American men who were able to go back and forth between China and the U.S. would often start families in China and then not see them for years at a time.
While never forgetting her Chinese roots, Yee over the years has grown to love America.
But Warner argues that theaters would work with networks, not compete with them.
For example, movie theaters could host video game tournaments where players compete with each across the country in a live event.
Warner hopes his company can use the expanding satellite network to show many different types of entertainment at the movie theater.
He had never heard of the popular British TV show "Dr.
He thinks that there are many TV shows, sports games, and live concerts that could bring people into movie theaters.
Today, movie companies make only a tiny amount of their money from these new offerings.
But in three to five years, they could be making 10 times more than they are making now.
The technology that movie theaters use is changing rapidly.
The new satellite system makes it much cheaper and easier to show movies and other content in theaters.
It costs about $250 to send out hard drives.
Using a satellite to send out the movies, however, costs only about $100.
Today, about three-fourths of the screens in the U.S. can hook up with the satellite network.
Warner hopes his company can use the expanding satellite network to show many different types of entertainment at movie theaters.
In the case of food safety, state labs are investigating foodborne illnesses and communicating with each other \u2014 without the help of federal authorities, in many cases \u2014 to figure out whether outbreaks have spread.
The coal mining industry has not had three consecutive days of fatal accidents in more than a decade.
Federal occupational safety and health inspectors also have stopped most workplace checks, and the National Transportation Safety Board is only investigating accidents if officials believe lives or property are in danger.
The Food and Drug Administration also has stopped routine inspections of food facilities in the United States and abroad, and border controls could be delayed.
The CDC also has had to halt its surveillance of flu, an infectious disease that kills about 24,000 Americans in an average year.
This early in the flu season there is little illness, meaning little to test yet.
CDC also is slashing its staffing on quarantine stations at 20 airports and entry points.
The lack of staff could heighten the possibility that some diseases could slip into the country at a time when measles is raging in Turkey and cholera is breaking out in Mexico.
The coal mining industry has not had three consecutive days of fatal accidents in more than a decade.
But to fill in the gap, some state health departments have been receiving and testing samples that otherwise would have gone to CDC, said Kelly Wroblewski of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.

Among the proposals being considered is action that would protect more than 5 million undocumented workers from deportation.
The government also added more flights to repatriate people to Central America, increased public awareness campaigns in Central America to stop people from leaving and increased enforcement by Mexican officials to stop immigrants from crossing that country en route to the United States.
That\'s going to happen before the end of the year," the president said.
Another proposal being considered by Obama is action that would include extending deportation protections to parents and spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for some years.
President Barack Obama has said he will issue an executive order changing some immigration policies.
But the monthly decrease is part of a continuing trend, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said last month.
This is exactly what the American people said on Election Day they didn\'t want," Boehner, Republican from Ohio, said Thursday.
Last summer, a huge number of unaccompanied children were stopped trying to cross the border into the United States.

Hundreds of border patrol agents were moved to the Rio Grande Valley.
Obama said that he warned a congressman that if "Congress failed to act, I would use all the lawful authority that I possess to try to make the system work better."
There were fewer children stopped crossing the border on their own in October than there were last year at the same time, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
There are already more than 11 million people living in the United States without permission.

For every five children who tried to cross the border into the United States in October 2013, there were only three children this October.
The government department is in charge of protecting the borders.
It added more flights to send people back home.
The president promised that he would take action by the end of the year.
We are going to fight the president if he does this, said Representative John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio.
After sifting through tens of thousands of distant stars, astronomers say they have discovered an Earth-size planet where water could exist in liquid form.
Rowe and his associates are still looking for more in the Kepler data \u2014 but after finding the Earth-like planet known as Kepler-186f, it seems reasonable to assume "that other ones are likely to exist.
Scientists who were not involved in the study were excited by the find.
It sits some 490 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus, and circles its home star, Kepler-186, in just 130 days.
In the past, scientists have argued that M-dwarf stars may not be particularly hospitable places for life to develop around.
"I believe that planets are very diverse and a whole range of them could be habitable," said astrophysicist Sara Seager.
Before it was hobbled last year by a broken gyroscope, the Kepler telescope stared at a patch of roughly 150,000 stars and waited for dips in the starlight as planets passed in front.
Close-in planets with shorter orbits complete these transits more often, which makes them easier to find.
And given that M-dwarf stars account for 70 percent of the stars in the Milky Way, there could be billions of Earth-size planets throughout the galaxy, waiting to be discovered.
"Whether we are an extremely rare fluke \u2014 a phenomenon that only happens once in a universe \u2014 or in a galaxy teeming with life is a very basic question not only of science, but of our existence," said planetary astrophysicist Dimitar Sasselov.
It\'s "the first time in human history we have a good shot at answering that question, and that\'s very exciting."
"The results are absolutely rock solid."

After sifting through tens of thousands of distant stars, astronomers say they have discovered an Earth-size planet where water could exist in liquid form.
But they said the groundbreaking discovery suggests that a large group of Earth-like planets is waiting to be found much closer to home.
But after finding the Earth-like planet known as Kepler-186f, it seems reasonable to assume "that other ones are likely to exist.
It could also mean that astronomers should be able to find plenty of similar planets closer to home.
Powerful telescopes in space will determine which planets have the strongest signs of water and atmospheres that can support life.
The discovery marks a breakthrough in the quest to find planets that are not just Earth-size, but truly Earth-like.
Out of 1,800 or so confirmed planets, fewer than two dozen sit in a zone where life could survive.
And none of the other planets are as close in size to Earth as Kepler-186f.
So even though Kepler-186f is closer to its sun than Mercury is to our sun, it is still safely located in a zone where life could survive.

Not all of the fish that finds its way into the garbage is the fault of people who buy but never end up using it.
In 2012, the most recent year for which estimates are available, Americans threw out some 35 million tons of food, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The 35 million tons of food discarded in 2012 is 20 percent more than the United States tossed out in 2000, 50 percent more than in 1990, and roughly three times what Americans discarded in 1960.
Food can only sit unused for so long.
There are plenty of fish in the sea.
Yet the minimum wage, one of the most important divisions between the contenders, came up only in passing.
Raising the national minimum wage to $15 would more than double the amount that employers must pay their workers in many areas.
The truth is, though, that no one really knows what it would mean for low-wage workers if the federal government required their bosses to pay them $15 an hour.
They might have asked Clinton to be clearer about what she thinks the appropriate level for the minimum wage is, or at least asked her to explain her thinking on the question.
She has spoken approvingly of legislation in Congress that would increase the minimum wage to $12 an hour nationwide.
In many areas of the country, raising the national minimum wage to $15 would more than double the amount that employers must pay their workers.
The Democratic candidates for president argued over gun control, the Iraq war and more in their first televised debate Tuesday night.

Most of the 370,000 children in Fukushima prefecture (state) have been given ultrasound checkups since the March 2011 meltdowns at the tsunami-ravaged Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant.
The most recent statistics, released in August, show that thyroid cancer is suspected or confirmed in 137 of those children, a number that rose by 25 from a year earlier.
Elsewhere, the disease occurs in only about one or two of every million children per year by some estimates.
Looking harder with routine check-ups, like the one in Fukushima, leads to quicker discovery of tumors, inflating the tallies in a so-called "screening effect."
Right after the disaster, the lead doctor brought in to Fukushima, Shunichi Yamashita, repeatedly ruled out the possibility of radiation-induced illnesses.
David J. Brenner, professor of radiation biophysics at Columbia University Medical Center, took a different view.
While he agreed individual estimates on radiation doses are needed, he said in a telephone interview that the higher thyroid cancer rate in Fukushima is "not due to screening.
The borders are constantly being remapped as cleanup of radiated debris and soil continues in an effort to bring as many people back as possible.
"Nonetheless, this study is critical to initiate additional investigations of possible health effects, for governmental planning, and increasing public awareness."

After four weeks of ferocious fighting, the guns of Gaza fell silent Tuesday with a 72-hour truce in place and talks on tap in Egypt aimed at forging a stable accord between Israel and Palestinian militants who rule the coastal enclave.
Though several previous cease-fires broke down in violence, Gazans venturing out for supplies or making their way toward ruined districts cut off by earlier fighting expressed cautious hopes that this might be the beginning of the end of the war.
Militants in Gaza sent a volley of 20 rockets toward Israel, with most of the projectiles intercepted by the Iron Dome antimissile system or falling harmlessly.
One of the last of them struck a Palestinian home in Beit Sahour, near biblical Bethlehem in the West Bank, causing damage but no injuries, according to Israeli media reports.
Indirect talks to be held in the Egyptian capital looked to be contentious.
And Egypt, which controls access to southern Gaza through a crossing at Rafah, has a government hostile to Hamas.
The fighting has exacted a heavy toll: nearly 1,900 Palestinians reported dead, with the toll likely to rise when bodies are recovered from previously inaccessible areas.
Israel launched an air offensive on July 8, which widened to a ground incursion on July 17, in response to weeks of heavy rocket fire.
Israel has come under heavy international criticism for failing to take sufficient steps to protect the civilian population.
Israeli authorities have blamed other scattered attacks in Jerusalem this week on angry sentiment stemming from Palestinian deaths in Gaza.

When Rick Rodriguez Sr. moved into a three-bedroom home in Downey, California, in the mid-1980s, he recalled a neighbor interrupting his yard work with a question: "You\'re not going to be one of those guys that parks in the front yard and lets chickens run around in the front yard, are you?"
Rodriguez, whose grandparents crossed into the United States illegally from Mexico, is part of a wave of second- and third-generation Latinos who have transformed Downey and numerous other Los Angeles suburbs, including Whittier, Pico Rivera, Van Nuys and Anaheim, over the last two decades.
Downey \u2014 a southeast Los Angeles County suburb that gave birth to space shuttles (and "Weird Al" Yankovic) \u2014 is nearly 75 percent Latino.
The weekend after he moved in, Alarcon decided it was time to wash his car.
If you follow your old customs, nothing will change.
"Now you have this young, mostly Latino population \u2026 a lot of young business owners are beginning to redefine Downey Avenue," said Flores, 32.

Dressed to impress, Jorge Magana, 18, zipped through his presentation slides with the confidence of a top executive.
Students can simply "go through the motions" in class, taking in information without really retaining it, she said.

Waits for rides often stretch over an hour, and visitors are having to park in remote structures, particularly on Sundays.
Industry experts say Disney might be better off focusing its attention on other theme park projects, including a $4 billion resort in Shanghai, slated to open next year.
"Maybe they\'ll do Star Wars Land or Indiana Jones Adventure or Marvel characters," said Todd Regan, founder of the Disney blog site MiceChat.com.
But estimates from Aecom, a Los Angeles engineering and consulting firm, show visitor numbers have increased nearly every year from 2004 to 2012.
Speigel said theme parks across the country could see double-digit increases \u2014 as much as 25 percent \u2014 in attendance this year.
Local pass holders often crowd the parks, leaving little space for out-of-town travelers who typically stay in Disney hotels and spend more on souvenirs.

"These types of marine mammals that are long-lived have a great ability to accumulate contaminants, and so they\'re often perceived as being sentinels of their ecosystem," said Usenko, who helped write the study.
One occurred when the whale was about 5 to 6 years of age and another happened when it was about 10 years old.
Because the whale seemed to travel up and down the California coast, perhaps it was swimming through regions with increased mercury contamination, the authors wrote.
Whales are often called marine sentinels because they can reveal a lot about the waters they swim through, said Sascha Usenko.

Humans and other primates are more susceptible to contagious yawning when they are around those with which they share "a close social bond."
They logged 254 hours of observation time over a five-month period, paying special attention to instances of yawning.
Only yawns that occurred when wolves were awake, relaxed and not in distress were included in the analysis.
(Nearby wolves were not counted if their eyes were closed at the time of the yawn.)
If they did, they noted the gap in time between the initial yawn and the follow-up yawn.
The scientists found that the wolves were indeed more likely to yawn after another wolf near them had yawned.
(Not only that, but among females, the closer the bond, the shorter the gap between the first and second yawn.)
People do it.

"The success of this procedure creates more opportunities to introduce new genetics into the African elephant population among zoos, diversifying the population and ensuring its ability to grow into the future," Baker said in a statement.
In 2011, teams from the Pittsburgh Zoo and Leibniz Institute, including Baker and Hildebrandt, traveled to the Phinda Resource Reserve in South Africa to help wildlife researchers to tranquilize and collect sperm from 15 wild bull elephants.
A third elephant inseminated through the process is now pregnant at another zoo in England.

Frozen Dumbo has the support of elephant conservation groups including the International Elephant Foundation.
"This has been done in other species, but never before in elephants," said the foundation\'s executive director, Deborah Olson.
For about 30 years, international zoos have exchanged elephants in a largely unsuccessful breeding program.
At the same time, efforts by zoos around the world to breed elephants in captivity have not been very successful.
At zoos in Austria and England, two baby elephants were artificially fathered with sperm gathered from South African wild elephants.
The process is still experimental but considered promising by international elephant conservation groups.

"It shows the Lebanese society to some extent catching up with the rest of the Arab world in terms of popular protests against the central government," said Rami Khouri, a senior fellow at the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut.
These longstanding grievances erupted after the government closed its main landfill July 17, offering Beirut no alternative site.
Mountains of garbage piled up on the streets, prompting a grassroots protest movement calling itself "You Stink."
The "You Stink" movement, a rare, non-political people\'s movement, quickly picked up supporters and expanded its demands beyond just the trash in the street: It demanded the resignation of the entire government.
The country has been without a president for more than a year, despite nearly 30 attempts by Parliament to pick a new one.
"We arrived in the morning and found everything broken; chairs on the floor; everything is a mess," said Joseph Khoury, who works at a car rental agency.
Some are already casting the huge protests of the past weekend as a revolt similar to those of the Arab Spring that toppled dictators across the Mideast beginning in 2011.
Anticipating more trouble, the Lebanese army took up positions around downtown Beirut, stationing armored personnel carriers on street corners.
Activists, however, quickly dismissed those actions as political maneuvering.
The "You Stink" movement also says it will not back down.

If that is not surprising enough, Crater Glacier is also growing at a time when most glaciers around the globe are shrinking.
A blast vaporized everything for miles around and leveled 230 square miles of forest.
That shell provided a perfect nest to nurture a baby glacier.
The USGS team feared the heat would melt the glacier and send water and mud tearing through the valleys below.
But the ice was so well insulated by its underlying rock layer that very little melted away.
A steady stream of meltwater called Loowit Creek also springs from the base of the glacier, nourishing willow trees and flowers below.

Sundquist made the switch after reading about antibiotics and hormones used in raising cows.
Take the experience of Stacey Sundquist, a lawyer in Virginia, Minn. She and her husband have three kids under age 10 who drink milk regularly at meals.
Now, she drinks more water and has developed a taste for almond milk, including in her morning oatmeal.
"I started questioning whether I needed cow\'s milk in my diet," she said.
The drop in milk consumption in 2011 and 2012 was the biggest in more than a decade, though interest in milk has been falling for years.
People drank 25 percent less milk from 1975 through 2012, according to numbers from the federal government.
The tall, cool glass of milk with a sandwich at lunch or a burger at dinner is increasingly a thing of the past.
Some consumers have been concerned about growth hormones used in dairy cows, business research company IBISWorld found.

The bones were found in a region of 100-million-year-old rock in Utah.
"It\'s more than just a new dinosaur," Makovicky explained.
The fully developed T. rex later ruled North America, until dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago.
Named Siats meekerorum, it was an important dinosaur before the days of Tyrannosaurus rex.
It was named after two things: a man-eating monster from the legends of the local Ute Indians, and the Meeker family, who are big supporters of the museum.
More bones were turned up, including vertebrae from the backbone.
From there it was a matter of bringing what they found back to the lab.

And the biggest illegal pot crop in state history was seized here on sacred forested acres where the tribe hunts and gathers food in the shadow of Mount Adams, also known as Pahto.

Concern about substance abuse dates from at least the 19th century, when the Yakama signed the Treaty of 1855 under great duress.
A lieutenant with the Yakama Nation tribal police force, Frederickson is one of the most skilled "spotters" in a multiagency task force aimed at getting rid of illegal pot statewide.
Each year the job has become more difficult, as growers with ties to Mexican cartels go to greater lengths to hide their efforts.
Like most voters in and around the reservation, Frederickson said he opposed legalizing a substance he has worked so hard to get rid of.
"Alcohol has such an impact here," Frederickson said.
A tribal elder with a deeply lined face, she spent 20 years at the Youth Treatment Center here, counseling young men and women with substance abuse problems.
"You have to go out in the community, and you have to let people know."

They got the name right whales because they were once considered the "right" whales to hunt.
By looking at the same image in different wavelengths\u2014including one able to penetrate 50 feet beneath the ocean\u2014the researchers were able to spot 55 probable whales and 22 possible whales in the gulf as well as 13 whale-shapes underwater.
New satellites will have higher quality imagery and will allow scientists to identify whales with greater confidence, Fretwell and his coauthors write.
Scientists already have used satellite imagery to count populations of penguins in Antarctica, and Fretwell said similar work was being done with seals.
The key to using satellites to track animals is not the size of the animal but how much it stands out from its environment, he said.

"I\'m not Mapuche but I believe in their culture," said Elba Soto, 56, who often comes to the ruka \u2014 a traditional Mapuche thatched home \u2014 looking for herbs and ointments to ease the pain in her bones.
The geometrical designs of the Mapuche have made their way into fashion shows from New York to Paris, their food is inspiring high-end cuisine, and popular singer Ana Tijoux waves the multicolored Mapuche flag during her concerts and raps about their struggle in her Grammy-nominated albums.
The Mapuche, a name that means "people of the land" in their original language, resisted invaders for centuries \u2014 first the mighty Incan empire, then the Spanish conquistadors who arrived five centuries ago in the area now known as Chile.
The Mapuche ultimately won treaties with the Chilean state recognizing their right to everything south of the Bio Bio river, or roughly the entire southern half of the long, thin country.
The survivors were pushed to the fringes of settled lands.
As group, they are far poorer and less educated than other Chileans, more prone to suffer illness, malnutrition and discrimination.
A radical faction of the Mapuche in Araucania has occupied and burned farms and lumber trucks to demand the return of lands.
Police have been accused of violent abuses, including storming into Mapuche homes during raids and shooting rubber bullets indiscriminately at women and children.
While most Chileans, and most Mapuche, reject the violence, the conflict has drawn attention to indigenous demands and interest in their culture.
"Before there was a lot of discrimination, lots of people looking down at us and many saw the Mapuche as the lowest of the low," said Hueitra, who wears the traditional "trapelacucha," a large silver collar that spreads to the chest.
It employs traditional cooking methods, such as cooking in the ground with live embers, and uses ingredients such as maqui, a berry that comes from a tree that is sacred to the indigenous group.
Chilean state television recently began broadcasting a historical drama called "Besieged: The Other Side of the Conquest," which focuses on the battle of Curalaba in 1598, a famous victory by the Mapuche against Spanish colonizers.

Of all the things young children put in their mouths, dirt may provoke the most concern among parents fearful that eating it will give kids worms.
Researchers have long been investigating the link between being too clean and failing immunity.
Fecal material from healthy people has been shown to help fight antibiotic-resistant infections in patients for whom nothing else worked.
In the developed world, it has been decades since intestinal worms were a familiar part of the human biome, the general term for all the organisms that thrive in people.
"As far as the big picture of human health goes, it\'s pretty much already accepted that when you put helminths back into the ecosystem of the human body, you can resolve allergic and autoimmune diseases," he said.
Although the use of helminths in humans is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (clinical trials are continuing), there are about 7,000 people in the world using helminths for a variety of diseases.
Parker, who recently published a study on self-treatment with helminths, said those using worms as a curative agent fall into two groups.
A lot of them are scientists, or are in the medical field; and the other half either knows one of those people or weren\'t that educated but got very, very sick" and educated themselves.
Depending on the species, helminths are administered through a liquid patients drink or are placed on a bandage applied to the skin, which absorbs them.
It will be some time before anecdotal reports of helminthic success are backed by enough clinical data to win FDA approval.
The clinical trials are complicated by issues of supply, the unknown of how many doses are needed, and how long treatment can take before showing results, Parker and Nandi said.
People considering self-treatment with helminths are advised to speak with their physicians.

"It\'s a great day when you can bring back a species from extinction," said Dunn, a technology consultant from Truckee.
At the center of that story is a torpedo-shaped trout with orange-red cheeks and sequined, rose-pink stripes that grows as large as salmon and inhabited Pyramid Lake when it was part of a much larger body of water called Lake Lahontan tens of thousands of years ago.
From near extinction to stunning recovery, its comeback is a rare win for threatened and [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species), a decades-long odyssey of biological risk and scientific discovery made possible by the uncommon commitment of a fisheries biologist laboring in one of the most remote corners of the West.
Another reintroduction at Fallen Leaf Lake near Lake Tahoe in California in 2002 also is paying dividends: Last year, Lahontan cutthroats spawned there in a tributary for the first time in more than 70 years.
"This is such an exciting story because this was such a unique fish," said Mary Peacock, an associate professor of biology and a genetics expert at the University of Nevada, Reno.
We thought those fish were gone.

It amazed them, because they\'ve never seen someone with a disability become so successful and so independent."
All of her previous achievements merely set the stage for 2013, when McFadden became the first person to win four major marathons \u2014 Boston, London, Chicago and New York \u2014 in the same calendar year, sandwiching those victories around a world championship performance in which she won every race between 100 and 5,000 meters.
McFadden had hatched her plan to try cross-country skiing \u2014 known as sit skiing in the Paralympics \u2014 after her 2012 summer season.
After she won the London Marathon in 2011, she asked Deborah if they could visit St. Petersburg before returning to the U.S. She returned to Orphanage 13, taking in the modest space that had seemed so huge to her when she was a tiny kid, navigating the halls on her hands.
After touring the orphanage, Tatyana met her birth mother.
"I was the first person with a disability to come back, and they were absolutely amazed \u2014 from scrawny to how strong I\'ve become," McFadden says.
"Very few women in the world are as fit as she is or can generate the power that she does, no matter what the sport," says her track coach, Adam Bleakney.
Some articles describe McFadden as having been "abandoned" in the orphanage, but she doesn\'t regard the experience that way.
"My birth mom, she had to do the hardest part," Tatyana adds.
"Going back and showing her the person I\'ve become was almost a way of saying thank you to her," she says.
She has remained in touch with Polivikova since their meeting and looks forward to racing in front of her and various cousins in Sochi.

In the first study, Sven Gould of the University of Dusseldorf and his colleagues deprived six sacoglossans of food for 55 days: two enjoyed 12 hours of light followed by 12 hours of darkness each day; two lived with the same cycle, but received a drug that disrupted photosynthesis; and the remaining two slugs lived in continuous darkness.
Sunlight would not help them endure this subterranean slumber, but a digestive sac full of nutritious chloroplasts to munch on would do the trick.
Flamingos get their red and pink pigments from the carotenoid proteins in the plankton they eat.
E. chlorotica, the shimmering emerald slug species that Rumpho studies, seems to be so dependent on algae for survival that if baby slugs are not exposed to algae for at least seven days, they stop growing and die.
Rather than producing sugars, the chloroplasts E. chlorotica captures from its algae primarily make lipids, which provide a source of energy as well as building materials for cells.
If so, captive chloroplasts would be so much more than a postponed meal for the slugs\u2014they would be more like a continually renewed vital organ.
In the first study, Sven Gould of the University of Dusseldorf and his colleagues deprived six sacoglossans of food for 55 days: two enjoyed 12 hours of light followed by 12 hours of darkness each day; two lived with the same cycle, but received a drug that disrupted photosynthesis; and the remaining two slugs lived in continuous darkness.
At the end of the starvation period, all the slugs were alive, equally pale and all had lost about the same amount of weight.
"It\'s very appealing to think that here you have an animal slowly turning into plant," Gould says.
E. chlorotica, the shimmering emerald slug species that Rumpho studies, seems to be so dependent on algae for survival that if baby slugs are not exposed to algae for at least seven days, they stop growing and die.
Some ant species routinely kidnap and enslave members of neighboring colonies.
Massive-winged frigate birds \u2014 also called pirate birds \u2014 swoop down on smaller seabirds and snatch the fish right out of their beaks.
They feed on simple underwater plants known as algae, which have no stems, roots or leaves, but do contain chlorophyll, a green pigment or coloring matter.
Oxygen is produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis.
Sven Gould of the University of Dusseldorf and his team deprived six sacoglossans of food for 55 days: two enjoyed 12 hours of light followed by 12 hours of darkness each day; two lived with the same cycle, but received a drug that disrupted photosynthesis; and the remaining two slugs lived in continuous darkness.
Some sacoglossans hibernate in the winter, burrowing into debris at the bottom of the ocean floor.
Even if these slugs are not relying primarily on photosynthesis for nutrition, they might be using some of the oxygen produced by the process.
Perhaps some of the slugs are camouflaging themselves \u2014 after all, they spend an awful lot of time hanging out on green plants.
The slugs could be taking advantage of this self-sufficiency to enjoy a few weeks or months of free oxygen.
E. chlorotica, the emerald-green slug species Rumpho studies, seems to be so dependent on algae that if baby slugs are not exposed to it for at least seven days, they stop growing and die.
What if E. chlorotica has given over its lipid production to chloroplasts?
Massive-winged frigate birds \u2014 also called pirate birds \u2014 swoop down on smaller seabirds and snatch the fish right out of their beaks.
The sea slugs known as sacoglossans are some of the most remarkable biological burglars on the planet.
The part of the algae that contains chlorophyll is a jelly bean\u2013shaped structure known as a chloroplast.
Large frigate birds \u2014 also called pirate birds \u2014 swoop down on smaller seabirds and snatch the fish right out of their beaks.
A recent study is forcing scientists to completely rethink this idea, however.
Scientist Sven Gould and his team ran an experiment involving six sacoglossans.
At the end of the starvation period, all the slugs were still alive.
Some sacoglossans hibernate in the winter, after burrowing into the bottom of the ocean floor.
None of the slugs were given any food at all for 55 days.
They feed on simple underwater plants known as algae.

Yet there is another possible explanation.
Julia took three years to create, and after consulting extensively with researchers, she was at first surprised that they recommended a girl.
As of now, Julia will not be appearing on the Sesame Street broadcast, said spokesman Philip Toscano.
Those groups see certain things differently, but what they had in common is they wanted to give families and children tools."
"We don\'t pretend that every child who is on the spectrum is the same," Westin said.
But the more she thought about it, the more it made sense to her.
Recently, Sesame Street Workshop unveiled its newest initiative, "Sesame Street and Autism: See Amazing in All Children."
Sesame is trying to tackle a fundamental problem: Autistic children are five times as likely to be bullied than their peers.
It mentions things like how when she plays with a toy bus, "she especially likes spinning the wheels around and around."
But Julia keeps swinging and doesn\'t look in Abby\'s direction, prompting Abby to say, "Your friend doesn\'t like me."

When the authorship of a book or play is contested, computer-enhanced stylometry can compare suspected authors\' "signatures" to that of the disputed work, yielding a scientific basis for assigning authorship.
In the end, two psychology professors from the University of Texas in Austin declared that the author of "Double Falsehood" \u2014 a tale of fathers, sons, duty and love set in Andalusia \u2014 was Shakespeare, and not his acolyte Lewis Theobold.
Theobold, a Shakespeare scholar and avid collector of manuscripts, published the play in 1728, claiming it came from three original manuscripts written by the Bard.
"Our results offer consistent evidence against the notion that Double Falsehood is Theobold\'s whole-cloth forgery," Boyd and Pennebaker wrote.
While Theobold\'s "psychological signature" was not evident, it did make "passing statistical appearances" \u2014 probably the result of Theobold\'s penchant for heavy editing, they added.
The researchers cite longstanding research that shows that the way writers use language, the words they choose, and even the length of their sentences bespeaks their cognitive style and temperament.
A deep analysis of a writer\'s verbal output can "paint a very rich picture of who that person is, how he or she thinks, and what he or she thinks about," they wrote.
For Shakespeare, much of whose life remains a mystery, the analysis offers a bit of insight: his frequent use of prepositions suggests he was rigorously educated in grammar.
His heavy use of "social content words" (vs. words related to thought processes or emotion) suggests he was more attuned to social niceties and advancement than he was either cerebral or preoccupied by his own or others\' feelings, the authors wrote.
Those manuscripts, however, were said to have burned in a library fire.

"Double Falsehood" is a play said to have been written by the 16th-century poet and playwright, William Shakespeare.
New research now says it is almost certainly the work of Shakespeare, who was nicknamed the Bard.

"Double Falsehood" is a play said to have been written by the 16th-century poet and playwright, William Shakespeare.
New research has found that an old play was probably written by William Shakespeare.
The new research says it is almost certainly the work of Shakespeare.
They used computers to pore through millions of sentences of text.
In the absence of proof, scholars became suspicious that Theobold was only pretending that the play was written by Shakespeare.
It shows that the way writers use language, the words they choose, and even the length of their sentences, shows things about how a writer thinks and acts.
His heavy use of "social content words" (instead of words related to thinking or feeling) suggests he was more attentive to how people in society acted and was less concerned with the way people thought or felt, the authors wrote.
The computers they used studied 54 plays \u2014 33 by Shakespeare, nine by Fletcher and 12 by Theobold.
Boyd and Pennebaker said the study showed evidence that the work was not a fake by Theobold.
Theobold claimed it came from three original pieces written by Shakespeare.
There was no physical proof that Shakespeare wrote the play.
It can also be used to give us a "better understanding" of who a person was and how they thought, they said.
Israeli troops battled Hamas militants on Wednesday near a southern Gaza Strip town as the top U.S. diplomat reported progress in efforts to end fighting that has so far killed more than 680 Palestinians and 34 Israelis.
Israel has insisted it must substantially curb the military capabilities of the Islamic militant group Hamas \u2014 a position that appears to have gained support within the U.S. administration \u2014 while Hamas has demanded the lifting of a crippling Israeli and Egyptian blockade on the impoverished coastal territory it has ruled since 2007.
On the ground, meanwhile, Israeli troops backed by tanks and aerial drones clashed with Hamas fighters armed with rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles on the outskirts of Khan Younis, killing at least eight militants, a Palestinian health official said.
Farther north, in the Shijaiyah neighborhood of Gaza City, which saw intense fighting earlier this week, an airstrike demolished a home, killing 30-year-old journalist Abdul Rahman Abu Hean, his grandfather Hassan and his nephew Osama.
"I spoke with him a day and a half ago," his mother, Evie Steinberg, told Israeli Channel 2 TV.
Israel says it launched the Gaza operation to halt Hamas rocket fire into Israel \u2014 more than 2,100 have been fired since the conflict erupted \u2014 and to destroy a network of cross-border tunnels, some of which have been used to stage attacks.
Pillay noted an Israeli drone strike that killed three children and wounded two others while they were playing on the roof of their home.
"These are just a few examples where there seems to be a strong possibility that international humanitarian law has been violated, in a manner that could amount to war crimes," Pillay told the 47-nation U.N. Human Rights Council, saying such incidents should be investigated.
As the Gaza death toll mounted, a 34-year-old Palestinian man was killed in clashes with Israeli soldiers near the West Bank City of Bethlehem, doctors said, a potentially ominous development in an area that has so far been relatively quiet.
Hundreds of residents of eastern Khan Younis were seen fleeing their homes as the battle unfolded, flooding into the streets with what few belongings they could carry, many with children in tow.
Meanwhile, a foreign worker in Israel was killed when a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed near the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon on Wednesday, police spokeswoman Luba Samri said.
In Jerusalem, 30,000 people attended the funeral of Max Steinberg, a 24-year-old from the San Fernando Valley of Southern California serving in the Israeli military.

When Porter the dog tries to figure out why his owner has placed a toy bone under a bucket, his response might provide some insight about human development, autism and other learning disabilities.
"And they might have been shaped in a way that\'s very different from any other animal species in part because, in a sense, they (behave) more like a human child who\'s cued in (to humans) than, say, a chimpanzee."
"More and more, we\'re learning that, although monkeys are really good evolutionary models because they\'re closely related to us, the environment they\'re in and the way they\'re raised is completely different," she said.
"They don\'t have language and, obviously, they\'re not human, yet they grow up in exactly the same environments as children and rely on some of the same kinds of cues," she said.

For all that we ask of dogs \u2014 loyalty, companionship, slipper-fetching \u2014 rarely have we asked what drives dogs.
Monkeys and other animal subjects have to be housed somewhere.
The Canine Cognition Center is the latest example of that growing interest in dogs and in what they can tell us about ourselves.

His studies found that dogs learned to associate humans with food.
The first wave of dog behavior studies peaked in the 1960s, but declined over the rest of the 20th century.
Now in the 21st century dog studies are picking up again.
The difference between recent studies of dogs and earlier ones is the motivation behind the studies.
"I think recently, that animals \u2014 dogs and cats \u2014 are seen more as persons in our home," said Erica Feuerbacher, who is studying dogs at the University of Florida.
Porter is growing up in the same kind of environment as human children, Santos said.
For that reason, comparing how he learns with the way people learn can tell us a lot about human development.

Dogs have "all sorts of jobs in the real world," Hare said.
They also look at how dogs react to cues, or signals, from the humans around them.
They "rely on some of the same kinds of cues," she added.
Santos said they have about 300 dogs signed up.
These include serving as guide dogs and detecting bombs and drugs.
Dogs are even used to sniff out diseases like cancer in people.
"Everything we learn about them helps us identify the best dogs for those jobs."
The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday lifted a decade-long ban on public murals, marking a decisive victory for artists who argued the law made no sense in a city with such a rich tradition of street art.
The 13-2 vote is expected to free a new generation of muralists to "reclaim our legacy as a mural capital of the world," said Isabel Rojas-Williams, executive director of the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles.
Advertisers sued the city on First Amendment grounds, arguing that muralists could create big, eye-catching displays that were banned for commercial enterprises.
Not all murals were halted \u2014 or treated equally \u2014 in what artists call the "dark ages" of the ban.
But when pop star Chris Brown put up 8-foot-high fanged creatures on a retaining wall at his Hollywood Hills home, neighbors deluged City Hall with complaints, the singer was cited and within weeks the cartoonish scene was obliterated.
In addition to aesthetic concerns about the murals, residents worry that they will attract graffiti and become "God-awful eyesores," he said.
"We should recognize that."

Following the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy in Connecticut, officials all over the country are trying to figure out the best way to keep schools safe.
In January, Sheriff Arpaio put his own new school safety plan into action.
He dispatched his volunteer posse to patrol 59 schools in Maricopa County.

"The bottom line is people need to decide whether they\'d rather import their labor or import their food," said Randall Patterson, a China Grove, North Carolina, farmer who grows strawberries, cucumbers and watermelons among his crops.
The 52-year-old third-generation farmer employs about 140 foreign-born workers on his 1,200-acre farm legally through a federal system similar to the one a bipartisan team of senators wants to overhaul and streamline.
And many of their former workers no longer show up because they fear being stopped by police on their way to the fields and deported.
Many Republicans and Democrats agree that the agriculture industry is suffering because of a broken immigration system.
Many of those on the right oppose providing any legal path for those here illegally, and many of those on the left argue that the agriculture component must be addressed only as part of a comprehensive package.
A bipartisan proposal in the Senate that would create a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people living in the United States illegally would allow quicker legalization for agriculture workers.
They would be granted a special "blue card" that provides them legal status.
The bill also calls for guest worker visas to be issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, rather than the Department of Labor, to ensure a sufficient workforce.
Yet, there are very few U.S.-born farm workers toiling in the fields.
More than 90 percent (245 people) of those applying were hired, but just 163 showed up for the first day of work.

Based on the fact that North Carolina has a later growing season than California and more southern regions, Wicker worries that his farmers could be left out of the mix if the caps are reached before the Carolina growing season gets going.

Pence defended the measure as a vehicle to protect religious liberty but said he has been meeting with lawmakers "around the clock" to address concerns that it would allow businesses to deny services to gay customers.
Although the legal language does not specifically mention gays and lesbians, critics say the law is designed to protect businesses and individuals who do not want to serve gays and lesbians, such as florists or caterers who might be hired for a same-sex wedding.
Also Tuesday, the Indianapolis Star urged Indiana lawmakers in a front-page editorial to respond to widespread criticism of the law by protecting the rights of gays and lesbians.
The newspaper says the uproar sparked by the law has "done enormous harm" to the state and potentially to its economic future.
Hundreds of protesters filled Arkansas\' Capitol to oppose the measure, holding signs that read "Discrimination is not a Christian Value" and "Discrimination is a Disease," and chanting "Shame on you" at Ballinger after the measure was endorsed by a House committee.
"I believe that many people will want to flee the state, and many people will want to avoid our state," said Rita Jernigan, a protester and one of the lead plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging Arkansas\' gay marriage ban.
Opponents of the bill hoped to target Hutchinson\'s promise to be a "jobs governor" made during his successful bid last year for the state\'s top office.
"There\'s not really any place to make any changes now," Republican Representative Bob Ballinger of Hindsville said about his proposal.
Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Tuesday that he wants a law on his desk by the end of the week to clarify that a new state law does not allow discrimination against gays and lesbians.

China has pledged to end the processing and sale of ivory \u2014 but has not said how quickly it will act.
On May 29, China destroyed nearly 1,500 pounds of illegal ivory in a public ceremony in Beijing.
China imported 62 tons of ivory from Africa in 2008, and imported it in 2009.
Meng said the Chinese government sells five tons of ivory a year to carving workshops but would "gradually" reduce that annual quota to zero.
Still, more than 20,000 animals are thought to have been killed for their tusks in each of the past two years.
Meng said attitudes towards conservation are changing throughout China, particularly among the younger generation.
Trophy hunters can also import ivory into the United States, as long as they do not sell it.

Parents hoping to avoid a wait for a visit with Santa Claus at Woodfield Mall in suburban Schaumburg, Illinois, can now reserve a spot in line with the jolly fellow \u2014 but it will cost them.
The new fee and elaborate home for Santa are part of a trend in the Chicago area and across the country to make holiday displays grander at shopping centers, with the aim of bringing online shoppers back to malls.
Holiday displays are "on the scale of what we are calling an attraction now," said Ruth Rosenquist, a spokeswoman for Noerr Programs, which trains and sends Santas and photographers to 278 malls across the United States, including Woodfield.
"I really believe that it\'s a result of online shopping and the fact that developers are now realizing that Santa Claus is a physical manifestation of the holidays, and he brings physical traffic back to the properties."
Malls in the Chicago area typically allow free visits with Santa but charge fees for photos and prohibit parents from taking their own pictures, operators say.
Mary Jo Shepherd, a Schaumburg parent who has brought her kids to Woodfield for years, considers the advance fee "a new level of greed."
She considers commercial Christmas exhibits, like the holiday window displays at Macy\'s in downtown Chicago, to be a "give-back" to customers, and was appalled a few years ago when Woodfield stopped letting parents take their own pictures during Santa visits.
But Matthew Caczewe, a father of two girls from suburban Elk Grove Village, Illinois, said he works in sales and understands why malls might have to charge for bigger exhibits.
John Sullivan, of Streamwood, Illinois, who once managed Santa mall exhibits and now portrays Santa at a variety of events, maintains a long list of free events on his website, at www.santainchicago.com Most cities, villages, park districts and chambers of commerce offer free visits with Santa and let parents take their own pictures, he said.

"My hope was that the Chicago project would create some awareness around the homeless," said Ian Todd, the man behind the hand-lettered signs.
"It was a bit shocking seeing all the homelessness," he said.
Some refused, but others acquiesced and Todd got to work.
The signs, all of which are photographed on his blog, tell varying stories of turmoil, from a single father struggling to support three children to a woman offering work so she can afford a bus ticket home.
Droney said he often gets accolades about the sign, but it is hard to quantify whether the lettering is really doing much.
In 2011, the Chicago Tribune newspaper profiled Christopher Devine, who was printing and laminating signs for the homeless.
Devine\'s signs were much simpler than Todd\'s, printed on white paper in bold Helvetica font with text declaring "Homeless" or "Please Help."
He said he notified his homeless friends before he left that he would no longer be able to make signs for them.
Clues to what our ancestors ate, how they interacted and what diseases they fought may be found in their teeth, according to a new study.
"I feel like we discovered a time capsule that has been right under our noses this whole time," said Christina Warinner, the lead author of the study.
Calcified plaque is the rough, bumpy stuff you might notice coating your teeth if you have skipped too many dental appointments.
Today, dentists scrape plaque off our teeth as part of our regular dental cleanings.
To find out, she scraped the fossilized plaque off the teeth of four skeletons of people who lived 1,000 years ago in a medieval convent in Dalheim, Germany.
After treating the samples with various chemicals, she put them through a machine that separates out the DNA.
"When we analyzed the dental (substance) we got 100 to 1,000 times more DNA fragments than we would have from a bone."
So this technique could be used to learn more about people from a wide range of time periods.
Clues to what our ancestors ate, how they interacted and what diseases they fought may be found in their teeth, according to a new study.
The challenge is how to access it."
But Warinner wanted to know whether it had also preserved DNA.
"What is exciting is it looks like the way (plaque) protects the DNA \u2014 almost like it is sealed in concrete \u2014 so it is more protected from the environment," she said.

But recently, it has become clear that fossilized plaque holds a huge amount of information.
They have hoped to find microscopic bits of food stuck in its hard material.
The skeletons were from people who lived about 1,000 years ago.
From those tiny pieces of DNA, Warinner and an international team of scientists determined that the bacteria that causes cavities and gum disease have not changed much in 1,000 years.
This provides direct evidence of what people ate 1,000 years ago.
This includes researchers who study the causes of lung diseases and ones who look at how dental diseases have changed over time.
Warinner notes that all groups of people who ever lived have had tooth plaque problems.

On April 30, Obama promised that he\'ll "go back at" the Guantanamo problem, which frustrated him during his first term.
A: According to a report by the Constitution Project, a policy research center, Pentagon officials considered a variety of Pacific island and other remote locations for holding men detained during the so-called war on terrorism that President George W. Bush declared after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.
The most secret of the facilities, Camp 7, holds an estimated 15 of the highest-value detainees, including those accused of planning the 9/11 attacks.
Although Cuba owns the Guantanamo land, the Supreme Court noted, the United States has exercised "complete jurisdiction and control" for more than 100 years.
In addition, the Bush and Obama administrations have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade the facility.
A: This a hotly debated topic.
Three of the 166 have been convicted of crimes by a military commission, seven have been charged with crimes \u2014 including the five accused of conspiring in the 9/11 attacks \u2014 and 24 may face criminal charges.
Until recently, most of the detainees were in Camp 6, where they were allowed to keep their cell doors open and move freely in a common area where they could watch television and eat together.
The most secret of the facilities, Camp 7, holds an estimated 15 of the highest-value detainees, including those accused of planning the 9/11 attacks.

Another 72 were "suspected of re-engaging" against U.S. forces, though there was no explanation of what evidence led to the suspicion.
Candidate Barack Obama pledged that he would close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.

Officials eventually turned to Guantanamo, which previously had been used to house Haitians and Cubans who had been picked up on the high seas trying to reach the United States.
Also, since it is part of Cuba, the men held there would not be able to access U.S. federal courts.
Three of the 166 have been convicted of crimes by a military court, seven have been charged with crimes - including the five accused of conspiring in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon - and 24 may face criminal charges.
Also, 46 face no criminal charges, but a review of their cases found them to be too dangerous to release.
The most secret of the facilities, Camp 7, holds an estimated 15 of the detainees, including those accused of planning the 9/11 attacks.
The Supreme Court ruled in a 2008 decision that Guantanamo detainees had the same constitutional right to file a habeas corpus petition as prisoners in the United States.
The justices decided that meant it was essentially part of the United States.
That works out to about $800,000 per prisoner.

A: The military considered many faraway locations for holding men after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
They also thought that the men held there would not be able to take their cases to U.S. courts.
The Supreme Court later said that was not fair.
However, they are thought to be too dangerous to release.
A: The military says it uses the term for most of the men because they have not been found guilty of crimes.
A: When the first detainees arrived, they were housed in wire pens that looked like a backyard dog kennel.
They could move freely out of their cells and watch television and eat together.
The Supreme Court ruled in a 2008 decision that the detainees could take their case to court, just like prisoners in the United States.
It also forbids transfers to risky foreign countries where it might be hard to keep track of them.
A: In January, the top U.S. spy reported on what had happened to the 603 men who had been transferred out of Guantanamo.
The report found that 97 went back to fighting against U.S. forces.
The U.S. conducted overnight airstrikes across northern Syria that appear to have caused major damage to the militants it targeted, according to reports Tuesday.
However, the Jordanian government said its air force had destroyed "terrorist" targets.
The Pentagon said that the Khorasan was allegedly plotting an attack very soon against the United States and Western allies.
Most residents were either sheltered in their homes during the predawn attacks or sought safety in basements, the activist said.
"If the targeting is precise on ISIS, then I am for it."
President Obama announced on Sept. 10, that U.S. forces may target ISIL inside Syria as part of a U.S. effort to "degrade and ultimately destroy" the group.

The United States attacked inside Syria for the first time on Tuesday.
The U.S. attacks are a sign that the fighting in the region is becoming worse and spreading.
One of them was the city of Raqqa in north-central Syria.
The strikes were carried out by different aircraft, including fighter jets and bombers.
The strikes "destroyed or damaged" several ISIL targets, said U.S. military leaders.
The U.S. military did not give any more details of the plot.
The civil war has made it easy for ISIL and other militant groups to spread.
It was not known how many were hurt or killed.

Lots of cats.
Opponents call it a cruel practice that prolongs the suffering of the cats, who can fall victim to cars, predators, disease and human cruelty.
The issue is highly emotional and potentially explosive, with arguments on both sides dismissed as "misinformation" and "propaganda."
Orange County Animal Services department partners with CARE Feline TNR and provides hundreds of free spay-and-neuter surgeries to the organization.
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has information on its website about risks to health and wildlife posed by cats.
A major line of attack against the practice \u2014 and the point of the column that got Williams in trouble \u2014 is that cats prey on and kill huge numbers of birds and other wildlife.
Alley Cat Allies, a national advocacy group based in Maryland, has been lobbying on behalf of TNR efforts since its founding in 1990.
The organization counters that human activity such as habitat destruction has a much greater impact on bird populations than predation by cats.
She contends that the anti-TNR argument "assumes we have a choice between cats and no cats.
"It\'s not as if you stop putting out bowls of food and the cats will go away," she added.
"The larger issue is that trapping and killing has not worked," said Elizabeth Holtz, staff attorney for Alley Cat Allies.
"It\'s not as if you stop putting out bowls of food and the cats will go away," she added.
"In most situations it is cruel to both the cats and local wildlife," said Teresa Chagrin, PETA\'s animal-care-and-control specialist.
"It\'s never going to go away," she said, looking out over her charges in the twilight.
"If people weren\'t putting out food, they would just go through the trash.
"It\'s never going to go away," she said, looking out over her charges in the twilight.
Tabbies, tuxedos and tortoiseshells \u2014 about 20 of the animals greet her each evening when she arrives in a parking lot next to the train tracks south of downtown Orlando.
She brings food every day to sustain the colony of feral \u2014 that is, wild or abandoned \u2014 cats.
It is just one of hundreds of feral-cat colonies her organization, CARE Feline TNR, supports in the state.
A major line of attack against the practice is the claim that cats kill huge numbers of birds and other wildlife.
"It\'s not as if you stop putting out bowls of food and the cats will go away," Holtz added.
When Terise Marchelos pulls up, the cats come running from all directions.
Tabbies, tuxedos and tortoiseshells \u2014 about 20 of the animals greet her each evening when she arrives in a parking lot in downtown Orlando.
Feral cats, they argue, can fall victim to cars, predators, disease and cruel humans.
He argued this was necessary in order to protect wild birds.
Outraged cat lovers protested, and Williams eventually apologized.
One study found they kill up to 3.7 billion birds and 20.7 billion other small animals annually.
She added, "It\'s not as if you stop putting out bowls of food and the cats will go away.
The animal-rights group PETA opposes TNR, however.
Chagrin thinks feral cats should be euthanized \u2014 that is, put to sleep.
"It\'s never going to go away," she said, looking out over her cats in the twilight.
TNR works like this: Volunteers trap cats, then take them to a veterinarian.
About 35,000 walrus were photographed Saturday about 5 miles north of an Inupiat Eskimo village called Point Lay.
Females give birth on sea ice and use ice as a diving platform to reach snails, clams and worms on the shallow continental shelf.
As temperatures warm in summer, the edge of the sea ice recedes north.
In 2011, scientists estimated 30,000 walrus along 1 kilometer of beach near Point Lay.
As a result, they are coming ashore in record numbers on a beach in northwest Alaska.
Females give birth on sea ice and use ice as a diving platform to reach snails, clams and worms on the shallow continental shelf.
Walrus in large numbers were first spotted on the U.S. side of the Chukchi Sea in 2007.
Stampedes can be triggered by a polar bear, human hunter or low-flying airplane.
The World Wildlife Fund said walrus have also been gathering in large groups on the Russian side of the Chukchi Sea.
Officials were putting together a team of scientists to figure out how they died.
Walrus use their tusks to "haul out," or pull themselves onto ice or rocks.
"The walrus are telling us  that the Arctic environment is changing extremely rapidly and it is time for the rest of the world to take notice, and also to take action to address the root causes of climate change," she said.
Chris Carroll remembers the first time he saw someone hack into an insulin pump and make it deliver a deadly dose.
They can do the same thing to X-rays and defibrillators, which provide a shock to the heart.
SANS is a private company that specializes in Internet security training.
In 2007, then-Vice President Dick Cheney had the wireless function on his heart defibrillator disabled.
If they did that, it would stop "somebody from doing something bad."
The technology magazine Wired published a report in April.
They can even change temperature settings on medical refrigerators that store drugs and blood.
"Both of the people I talked to had no idea this was possible, and had no answer regarding plans to fix the issue," he said.
X-rays and defibrillators \u2013 which regulate the heart \u2013 are also linked to networks.
The insulin helps people with diabetes keep their blood sugar at healthy levels.
It also said banks and retailers are more prepared for these attacks.
It said that an official from Essentia Health found that cyber intruders can change how drug pumps work.
These records are attractive targets to hackers.
He said it was hard to say how big the risk of private medical information leaks was.
For many Americans, Chinese New Year conjures up images of colorful parades and fireworks in Chinatowns across the United States.
Hundreds of millions have moved from rural areas to cities in recent decades.
Earlier this month, a Chinese woman in Guangdong province was so upset with her long-lost son that she purchased a front-page ad in the Chinese Melbourne Daily.
They moved to Beijing to take factory or service jobs, often living in run-down and crowded conditions.
When she was asked for her name and details for a news story, she got nervous and walked away.
The recovered wages could help migrants return home for Spring Festival.
Pressure on stingy and crooked bosses had recovered 10.9 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) in unpaid wages for more than 1.5 million workers across the country, according to the Chinese government.
For many Americans, Chinese New Year conjures up images of colorful parades and fireworks in Chinatowns across the United States.
The occasion is when Chinese workers are expected to return to their home villages.
She urged him to visit for the holiday.
Relying on Chinese media for reports about Spring Festival can be tricky.
A well-known migrant community called Pi Village sits in northwestern Beijing.
In China, there\'s a popular song with a line that goes: "No matter if you have money or not, you should return home for Spring Festival."
For Americans, Chinese New Year brings to mind colorful parades and fireworks in Chinatowns across the United States.
The Lunar New Year festival, or Spring Festival, starts Friday for this Year of the Horse.
Chinese workers are expected to return to their home villages for the holiday.
A day earlier, Chinese officials reported that they were trying to help migrants get money they were owed.
On a recent gray morning, Fred Collins, an elder with the Northern Chumash Tribal Council, stood at the base of the rock and looked skyward as a peregrine falcon glided over the jagged peaks.
"It\'s broadly the policy of the department to allow reasonable requests for religious practices to take place on state park property," Joe Mette, then district superintendent for the California Department of Parks and Recreation, said in 2002.
Under state law, the state parks department is required to consult with Native American tribes when their sacred sites or cultural institutions are affected by projects or policies.
On a recent gray morning, Fred Collins, an elder with the Northern Chumash Tribal Council, stood at the base of the rock and looked skyward as a peregrine falcon glided over the jagged peaks.
Craggy, dome-shaped Morro Rock rises 576 feet above the shore, an attractive site for climbers and a sacred one for two Native American tribes.
The permit was approved and permission was granted.
According to Joe Mette, a former district superintendent for the California Department of Parks and Recreation, it is normal for the department to allow reasonable requests for religious practices to take place on state park property.
In the past, climbers have had to be rescued after failed attempts to reach the top.
Last month, three 15-year-old boys who were trying to scale the east face had to be saved.
The mound is a sacred site for two local Native American tribes.
Morro Rock has been a state historic landmark and falcon preserve since 1968.
It is a sacred place for two local Native American tribes.
The Salinans see something different in Morro Rock.
He has a special religious ritual that he practices when he is on the mountain.
"I think of that as the crucial element," Hirst said, "and I don\'t think he would have reached that conclusion quite the way he did if it hadn\'t been for this moment (in mining country) away from all the pressure....
"The humorous story is American, the comic story is English, the witty story is French.
"People can explore gold mining in any number of places \u2014 they come here because of Mark Twain," said Jim Fletcher, a retired middle school English and history teacher.
"The 150 celebration will change everything in our town for the better and, hopefully, supply a much richer and educationally rewarding visit to our community."
In a humble-looking notebook a century and a half old, there\'s an important entry that\'s barely longer than a tweet: "Coleman with his jumping frog \u2014 bet stranger $50 \u2014 stranger had no frog &amp; C got him one \u2014 in the meantime stranger filled C\'s frog full of shot &amp; he couldn\'t jump \u2014 the stranger\'s frog won."
His friend, Artemus Ward, was a well-known humor writer who mentored Twain in those early days.
Twain decided to use the frog tale he had heard about from the miners.
Over the next 45 years, Twain continued to show the world a new kind of humor in stories like "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."
To help curb the spread of the deadly virus Ebola, the United States and Britain are sending troops and equipment to West Africa, officials said Monday.
The military forces will build treatment facilities in Liberia and Sierra Leone to help care for victims of the virus.
"When patients are turned away at Ebola treatment centers, they have no choice but to return to their communities and homes," the WHO said in a statement.
In Liberia alone, about 152 health care workers have come down with the virus and 79 have died, according to the WHO.
By contrast, the U.S. has about 250 doctors for every 100,000 people, according to the World Bank.
In neighboring Sierra Leone, a WHO doctor who was working at one Ebola facility tested positive for the virus.
President Barack Obama said that the U.S. military will help set up isolation units and equipment for the public health workers arriving in West Africa from around the world.
But troops will ensure that supplies are maintained at the hospital.
The troops will also provide any support needed to keep the hospital functioning for up to 180 days.
Obama said that the U.S. needs to make the effort now to keep Ebola from spreading through Africa and other parts of the world.
The British government said Monday that British military engineers and medical experts will build and operate a care facility near the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown.
The care facility will have a total of 62 beds.

Thousands more could become infected before the worst Ebola outbreak on record is brought under control, the WHO has warned.
In Liberia, the number of new cases is increasing far faster than the number of hospital beds, the WHO said Monday.
In Liberia alone, about 152 health care workers have come down with the virus and 79 have died, according to the WHO.
The disease can cause kidney and liver failure, as well as bleeding inside the body.
The doctor will be evacuated from the area, the agency announced Monday.

General Mills, the biggest seller of cereal in the United States, announced another disappointing quarter Wednesday morning, marking the sixth straight time the company has reported lower sales.
Other cereals, such as the once-coveted brand Wheaties, have not fared so well over time.
Last year, sales of Wheaties dipped to $17 million, according to Euromonitor, marking at least the 10th consecutive year in which people bought fewer boxes of the whole-grain flakes.
Over the past decade, several shifts have taken place atop the cereal world.
Kashi, although it has struggled as of late, has posted considerable growth since the mid-2000s, too.
Wheaties has seen sales drop nearly 80 percent over the past 10 years.

Overall, cereal sales are down 6 percent since their peak in 2009, and they are projected to continue falling through at least 2019.
Muesli, the most resilient of the bunch, has been the only type of cereal to post consistent growth.
And Rice Krispies sales have contracted by 32 percent.
Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Lucky Charms also remain popular.

White House officials have decided that President Barack Obama will not use the word "genocide" to describe the killings of more than 1 million Armenians at the hands of Ottoman Turks when he commemorates the deaths Friday, the 100th anniversary of the massacres.
White House officials defended the decision as necessary to preserve the chance of cooperation with Turkey, a NATO ally, on Middle Eastern conflicts.
The statement from National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said the United States would use the anniversary of the onset of the massacres to "urge a full, frank and just acknowledgment of the facts that we believe is in the interest of all parties."
But, the official added, "the approach we have taken in previous years remains the right one \u2014 both for acknowledging the past, and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present," a reference to U.S. hopes for cooperation from Turkey, particularly in the civil war in Syria.
Turkish officials base their argument that the killings do not meet the definition of genocide on the claim that no deliberate plan to eliminate Armenian populations was involved.

In a rare Oval Office address, President Barack Obama vowed Sunday night the United States will overcome a new phase of the terror threat that seeks to "poison the minds" of people here and around the world, as he sought to reassure Americans shaken by recent attacks in Paris and California.
"I know that after so much war, many Americans are asking whether we are confronted by a cancer that has no immediate cure," he said, speaking from a lectern in his West Wing office.
Authorities say a couple carried out the attack and the wife pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group and its leader in a Facebook post.
He announced no significant shift in U.S. strategy and offered no new policy prescriptions for defeating the Islamic State, or ISIS, underscoring both his confidence in his current approach and the lack of easy options for countering the extremist group.
Still, he called on Muslims in the United States and around the world to take up the cause of fighting extremism.
Obama stands little chance of getting the Republican-led Congress to agree to any gun control measures.
On Thursday, the Senate rejected legislation barring people the government suspects of acts of terror from purchasing firearms.
However, the group has set its sights elsewhere in the world, launching attacks in Lebanon and Turkey and downing a Russia airliner over Egypt.
The woman pledged allegiance to ISIS and its leader in a Facebook post, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140225_UKRAINE_Crimea.jpg" />SIMFEROPOL, Ukraine \u2014 There are no words in the lexicon of the Abdulkerimov family more terrible than "occupation" or "deportation," two foreign terms with no precise translation in the Crimean Tatar language.
"If somebody tells me today that another deportation is possible, I would tell him that he is an idiot and nothing of the kind can happen again," said Jafer Abdulkerimov, a frail 81-year-old man with bright eyes, a steady voice and a sound memory.
Repression and deportation followed; over the next half a century, more than 600,000 Tatars were forced to leave, Abdulayeva said.
On May 18, 1944, Jafar, his two brothers and his mother were awakened at 5 a.m., along with hundreds of other families in the highland village of Shelen, close to the Black Sea coast.
Huddled below deck, the deportees saw the light of day only when a hatch door was opened to dump a dead woman overboard, he recalled.
"Women and children were crying and wailing while old men were praying," Abdulkerimov said in an interview.
In December, Aksenov reportedly led a group of Russian nationalists who rampaged through a new settlement on the outskirts of Simferopol called Molodezhnoye, or "youth," where dozens of Crimean Tatars were building homes.

"If somebody tells me today that another deportation is possible, I would tell him that he is an idiot and nothing of the kind can happen again," said Jafer Abdulkerimov.
"But then again, if somebody had told me before last week that another occupation of our land by a foreign army is possible, I would have told him he was an idiot too," Abdulkerimov added.

Taking a harder line on crimes no longer seen as juvenile pranks, state lawmakers around the United States are proposing stiffer penalties for people who threaten schools at a time of fears over terrorism and mass shootings.
While most states already have laws that allow prosecution of a school threat as a felony, there have been proposals across the U.S. to increase punishments, said Michael Dorn, executive director of the school safety nonprofit group Safe Havens International.
His son was caught up in a 3 1/2-hour lockdown at his Fairfield high school in October after a telephone threat.
"As we were kids growing up \u2014 I\'m 51 \u2014 we always had the notion that it was a childish prank," said Hwang, a Republican.
An analysis by National School Safety and Security Services, a Cleveland, Ohio-based consulting firm, found a 158 percent increase in the number of threats that schools received in a five-month span in 2014 compared with the same period the previous year.
About 37 percent of the threats were sent electronically, and nearly a third resulted in schools being evacuated.
Some states have laws that specifically address threats at schools, including Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Virginia and Washington, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
A bill that cleared the California Legislature would have created a specific crime for someone who threatens to discharge a firearm on a school campus, but it was vetoed in September.
Dorn said school threats are a popular approach for people who want to cause major disruptions.

But on some days scientists are catching and releasing as many as 30 sharks in one hour in the shallow waters at the southern edges of the bay, Hobbs said.
Scientists could catch the sharks and cut them open to study what the sharks eat when they swim into the former salt ponds.
Most of the water in the southern edges of San Francisco Bay is less than 10 feet deep, so during low tides vast areas of mud flats are exposed.
"We\'re starting to see a lot more leopard sharks and also bat rays in the ponds now," said Eric Mruz, manager of the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in Fremont.
"It\'s pretty much a buffet tray for them," said Jim Hobbs, a fisheries biologist with UC Davis who is helping lead the research in areas off Union City, Menlo Park and Alviso.
Traditionally, leopard sharks that wanted to eat from those shallow waters had to swim to the middle of the bay every low tide to avoid being beached.
"We\'re starting to see a lot more leopard sharks and also bat rays in the ponds now," said Eric Mruz, manager of the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in Fremont.
"If Steven Spielberg would do a movie about leopard sharks that would be wonderful," Slager said.
When most people think of sharks along the southern edges of San Francisco Bay, they think of ice skates, pucks and helmets.
Traditionally, leopard sharks that wanted to eat from those shallow waters had to swim to the middle of the bay every low tide to avoid being beached.
Now, Hobbs said, they can stay in some former salt ponds for days, fattening up.
But there are four species \u2014 leopard, spiny dogfish, brown smooth hound and sevengill \u2014 that are commonly found in the bay.
The sharks have been swimming through levee breaks and into old salt evaporation ponds.
"It\'s pretty much a buffet tray for them," said Jim Hobbs, a biologist who is helping lead the research in particular areas along the bay.
The spray water enters their stomachs and makes the sharks throw up.
Researchers preserve the thrown-up shark food to carefully classify and determine what the sharks are eating.
"We\'re starting to see a lot more leopard sharks and also bat rays in the ponds now," said Eric Mruz, manager of the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge.
Before 2003, leopard sharks that wanted to eat from those shallow waters had to swim to the middle of the bay every low tide to avoid being washed ashore.
Now they can stay in some former salt ponds for days and fatten up, Hobbs said.

Case studies have linked vision and literacy, Hopkins researchers say, but there has never been a large-scale epidemiological study on school-age children with conclusions drawn from their reading performance in the classroom.
So far, the results have been staggering \u2014 of the 250 students tested between January and March, 150 met the criteria for needing glasses.
The city also has a history of shortcomings when it comes to ensuring that students are screened and treated properly.
In the last academic school year, she said, the department increased its vision screening rate to 96 percent.
Fewer than 20 percent of students who screen positive for vision deficiencies end up getting glasses, she said.
Wen said lack of vision care is a "big problem" among city students, exacerbating educational barriers like truancy and drop-out rates.
The health department is looking at innovative ways to get glasses to students, such as mobile eye clinics.
The study includes second- and third-grade students, who are at a critical time in their educational trajectory.
A team of researchers at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins Hospital might have figured out that "something else."
The study begins with a reading exam, and students who receive glasses take another exam at the end of the school year.
The Maryland State Department of Education requires students to be screened for vision only in the first grade and ninth grade.

So when the third-grader could not read a relatively simple sentence on the board, his teacher, Maygon Thompson, was puzzled.
"I thought he was kidding," said Thompson, a special educator at the school in Southwest Baltimore.
She is trying to produce a first-of-its-kind study that attempts to link vision problems and literacy, or reading and writing, in groups of school children.
Their initial study will include a sample of 300 students from 12 schools who will have their eyes examined and, if needed, be measured for glasses.
The Maryland State Department of Education requires students to have their vision tested only in the first grade and ninth grade, leaving a lot of time for problems to go unnoticed.
Fewer than 20 percent of students who test positive for vision problems end up getting glasses, she said.
Bob Slavin, a Hopkins education professor, believes money and how the reading problem is labeled are the reasons the connection between vision and literacy has never been explored deeply.
At Charles Carroll Barrister, where fewer than two-thirds of third-graders passed a 2014 state test, the impact of the study could be huge.
Alexander Dominguez breezed through worksheets in the month after he joined the third-grade class at Charles Carroll Barrister Elementary School and quickly became one of the best students.

The students will be given glasses if they need them.
More than half the students needed glasses.
"This is so helpful," she said of the study.
There also were not enough people to make sure students received glasses if they needed them.
Students who need glasses receive two pair.
It could help show what the students really know, and if poor eyesight is getting in the way.
Now the Bothell archaeologist is back in the spotlight with another set of prehistoric bones, along with DNA evidence that helps resolve a long-standing puzzle about the first Americans.
Divers stumbled across a trove of prehistoric animal bones and one of the oldest, most complete human skeletons in the Western Hemisphere.
That jibes with genetic studies documenting their descent from Siberians believed to have migrated east into the land mass that once linked Asia and Alaska, and thence into the Americas beginning about 17,000 years ago.
The study is the first to show that despite having unusual features, at least one Paleo-American \u2014 Naia \u2014 is descended from the same ancestors as modern Native Americans, said WSU anthropologist Brian Kemp.
Alberto Nava, one of the divers who discovered the skeleton in 2007, said he and his colleagues swam through a mile-long tunnel before reaching a chamber the size of a basketball arena.
Heaps of bones on the chamber floor, nearly 150 feet below sea level, later were identified as those of sabertooth cats, elephant-like creatures called gomphotheres and giant sloths.

Ebola outbreaks in the past few decades have consistently "burned out" in relatively isolated and rural areas in Central Africa where ill patients did not come into contact with many individuals.
And already devastating projections from the WHO and the CDC suggest that the death toll could soon climb to the tens of thousands if efforts to contain the epidemic are not substantially increased.
The massive scale-up in resources provided by international forces could lessen that disease burden.
Yet the longer the response takes, the greater the possibility that areas that are now Ebola-free or that become Ebola-free could flare up again with the importation of new cases.

After addressing the issue of race sparingly in his first term, President Obama on Thursday unveiled an initiative explicitly aimed at a group he says demands urgent attention \u2014 black and Latino young men.
"So often, the issues facing boys and young men of color get caught up in long-running ideological arguments \u2014 about race and class and crime and poverty, the role of government, partisan politics," the president said in a packed White House East Room.
Obama on Thursday signed a presidential memorandum setting up a task force to figure out which public and private efforts are working and how to expand upon them.
Several foundation leaders joined Obama to announce plans to invest at least $200 million over the next five years in education, parenting, criminal justice and job programs.
The president has seen the results in his interaction with the Becoming a Man group from Hyde Park Academy.
"I think the president\'s getting as much out of this as they are," said Anthony Ramirez-Di Vittorio, a clinical social worker at the Youth Guidance nonprofit that runs the program, which he founded.
"So often, the issues facing boys and young men of color get caught up in long-running ideological arguments \u2014 about race and class and crime and poverty, the role of government, partisan politics," the president said in a packed White House East Room.

On Thursday, however, he unveiled a program aimed at helping a group he says demands urgent attention \u2014 black and Latino young men.
"So often, the issues facing boys and young men of color get caught up in long-running ideological arguments \u2014 about race and class and crime and poverty, the role of government," the president said to a packed White House room.
But the program is unique for Obama in that it is targeted specifically at race.
The president has seen the results already in his meetings with the Becoming a Man group from Hyde Park Academy.
On Thursday, however, he unveiled a program aimed at helping a group he says demands urgent attention \u2014 black and Latino young men.
A key part of its mission is to identify and support existing programs that have been successful in helping young minority men stay out of trouble, succeed in school or land good jobs.
The new program was shaped in part by two meetings Obama had with a chapter of the Chicago-based group Becoming a Man.
"I think the president\'s getting as much out of this as they are," said Anthony Ramirez-Di Vittorio, a social worker who runs the program.
During his first term, President Obama rarely brought up the issue of race.

The curfew, in the second of its three days, closed much of the country and stranded all but essential services workers and health volunteers at home.
"Today, the life of everyone is at stake, but we will get over this difficulty if we all do what we have been asked to do," Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma said in a televised address late last Thursday, shortly before the curfew took effect.
The incident east of Freetown, the capital, was the latest sign that poor communication on Ebola by governments and global health agencies has bred public suspicion and resentment, with rumors that the virus is a conspiracy by outsiders to kill people.
After visiting a house, a team makes a chalk mark on the exterior to show that residents had been seen.
The aim of the project was to find Ebola sufferers who refused to go into isolation treatment wards, placing others at risk.
"It has been our experience that lockdowns and quarantines do not help control Ebola, as they end up driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers," the medical charity Doctors Without Borders said in a statement when the curfew was proposed.
At least 562 people are believed to have died from Ebola in the country.
They operate in teams of four, each of which is expected to see 20 households a day.

Ebola is very contagious.
The visits are also supposed to make people less afraid and more trusting of the government.

And truck buyers especially like to get deals, Toprak said.
Many independent auto websites suggest prices that people should pay that are below the sticker price, he said.
In May, Nissan Motor Co. took the opposite strategy.
When the trucks were introduced, GM kept sticker prices the same as 2013 models, Cain said.
The increase has been planned for a long time, he said.
Cain says GM can command higher prices because it has the newest truck in the market with more features, including increased gas mileage.

Young Guatemalan designers are using them for everything from evening gowns and purses to handmade shoes sold as far away as Dubai.
"There were people who would tell you that they thought that traditional textiles were just for cushions and tablecloths, but I tell them that they can be used in many ways."
"What we are trying to do is strengthen the Mayan languages that little by little are not being spoken," said Kan, who performs in the indigenous language of Tzutujil.
"The Mayans took all their world views and their oral traditions and expressed their thoughts and ideas on their outfits," Pop said.
In more recent decades, the weaving on such fabrics became more modern with more colors mixed into the designs.
One of their greatest remaining possessions, he said, is their millennia-old culture.
"Each textile they make is absolutely unique, they don\'t make it twice and that intellectual property should be paid for, too."
"It doesn\'t bother me that they use the typical clothing because if they like it, I can\'t be mad about this," Qel said.

There are yoga classes before school starts and walking and running clubs after school.
Then, she lets kids make up their own games.
A group of kids recently invented a game called "Diary of a Wimpy Kid tag."
More than six decades after Kathryn "Tubby" Johnston Massar cut off her braids, tucked her hair under her cap and became the first girl to play Little League baseball, she\'s delighted to see two girls in the Little League World Series.
Davis pitched a two-hitter to help Philadelphia beat Nashville 4-0.
Davis, who received a noticeably louder reception than any other player during introductions, said she noticed plenty of girls younger than her in the audience.
I never thought at the age of 13 I would be a role model," Davis said.

Three U.S.-based scientists won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discovering how important substances are transported within cells, a process involved in such important activities as brain cell communication and the release of insulin.
James Rothman, 62, Randy Schekman, 64, and Dr. Thomas Sudhof, 57, shared the $1.2 million prize for their research on how tiny bubbles called vesicles act as cargo carriers inside cells.
The awards in physics, chemistry, literature, peace and economics will be announced by other prize juries this week and next.
It left an indelible mark on my memory."
Berg, who now directs the Institute for Personalized Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, said the work provided the framework that scientists use to study how brain cells communicate and how other cells release hormones.
Established by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the Nobel Prizes have been handed out by award committees in Stockholm and Oslo since 1901.

The place where a kid can be a kid also wants to be the place where mom can get a cappuccino and dad can chow down on an artisan-like pizza.
New offerings include California Alfredo thin and crispy pizza with mushrooms and spinach and, for a limited time, New York-style cheesecake.
Nationwide, the company rolled out the Cali Alfredo pizza along with an update to its BBQ chicken pizza, now with a smoky barbecue sauce and fried onions.
She doesn\'t think she\'d order any of the new pizzas on a regular "family fun day" outing, adding "that\'s not going to happen."
"We are a real restaurant, and having that test kitchen will ensure that this is not just a one-time big bang," Leverton said.
Beyond the food, the company is updating its technology, adding Wi-Fi to U.S. locations.
Added Leverton: "We want to make sure the adults are as excited about the visit as the children.
New offerings include California Alfredo thin and crispy pizza with mushrooms and spinach and, for a limited time, New York-style cheesecake.
"If we provide a good experience for mom and dad," he added, "they are going to be more willing to take their kid to Chuck E. Cheese\'s instead of \u2026 going out to a competing place."
All locations in North Texas are being remodeled in the coming months.
In some local outlets, the company will test the new "play pass" system, replacing tokens.
Added Leverton: "We want to make sure the adults are as excited about the visit as the children.
The menu was a great opportunity to really do that."
The change is meant in part to make the restaurant more appealing to adults.
New menu items include California Alfredo thin and crispy pizza with mushrooms and spinach and, for a limited time, New York-style cheesecake.
But, he added, "If we provide a good experience for mom and dad, they are going to be more willing to take their kid to Chuck E. Cheese\'s instead of \u2026 going out to a competing place."
None of the parents spotted during the dinner hour were dining on the new menu items.
Nearby, Zab Herrera, 38, also handed out slices of pepperoni pizza to his daughters.
"We want to make sure the adults are as excited about the visit as the children.
But marine biologists \u2014 including SeaWorld critics \u2014 agree that the whales probably will never be released to the open seas.
"They are not good candidates for release to the wild, either because they were born in captivity or because they have been in captivity for a very long time," said Naomi Rose, a marine mammal scientist for the Animal Welfare Institute.
Caretakers say they spent up to $300,000 a month to care for and attempt to train the whale to feed itself in the wild.
During a short swim outside of the pen, accompanied by caretakers on a ship, Keiko swam away and turned up in a deep inlet in Norway where he was found cavorting with children and fisherman along the shore.
"They are blindsiding it because they don\'t want a solution," said Ingrid Visser, founder of the Orca Research Trust, a New Zealand-based nonprofit dedicated to education and the research of orcas.
But marine biologists \u2014 including SeaWorld critics \u2014 agree that the whales probably will never be released to the open seas.
No enclosed sea pens exist to hold all 11 whales, either as a group or individually.
"They would not be better off in sea pens than where they are now," said Chris Dold, the lead veterinarian for SeaWorld Entertainment.
During the commission hearing, SeaWorld critics waved banners calling for the release of the whales.
"They are blindsiding it because they don\'t want a solution," said Ingrid Visser, founder of the Orca Research Trust, a New Zealand-based nonprofit dedicated to education and the research of orcas.
A documentary released in 2013 accuses the company of neglecting and abusing its orcas.
Dold and other SeaWorld supporters say sea pens could expose orcas to ocean toxins, viruses and harsh weather.
During the commission hearing, SeaWorld critics waved banners calling for the release of the killer whales.
It calls for SeaWorld Orlando in Florida to release a killer whale featured in "Blackfish," Tilikum, to a sea pen.
After several years at a theme park in Mexico City, Mexico, the killer whale was transported to a sea pen in Iceland in 1998\\.
There, he was found cavorting with children and fisherman along the shore.
"They are blindsiding it because they don\'t want a solution," said Ingrid Visser, founder of the Orca Research Trust, a nonprofit group dedicated to education and the research of orcas.
High court rulings in both cases would guide lower courts in deciding such lawsuits in the future.
Specifically, a decision in the accommodation case could shift some lawsuits from federal to state court, set the standard for the accommodation employers must make and allow workers to sue smaller employers \u2014 those with eight workers versus those with 25 as required in federal cases.
Attorneys for the company, which employs about 130 workers at Sea-Tac, wrote in an email that Gate "takes its legal obligations very seriously, including those that are designed to protect the rights of its employees."
While low in numbers, religious-based workplace complaints to both the state and federal governments have been on the rise since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
And a poll this year by the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding in New York found the most common religious-based conflicts involved being required to work on a religious holiday or attending company events where foods were not halal, kosher or vegetarian.
Hardeep Rekhi, a Seattle attorney, recently got a default judgment in a lawsuit he filed on behalf of a Muslim man fired from his job as a security guard after he refused to shave his beard, which he wears closely cropped in keeping with his religion.

For security reasons, it prohibits its workers from bringing their own meals to work.
This comes at a time when employees are increasingly asserting their religious identities at work.
She said state law does not require employers to accommodate religious practices.
She claimed her supervisor told her to give false information to another employee against her religious beliefs.
In doing so it concluded that the high court, lawmakers and Human Rights Commission, which enforces the state anti-discrimination law, had never formally recognized religious accommodation under state law.
It could set the standard for the accommodation employers must make.
While low in numbers, religious-based workplace complaints to both state and federal governments have been on the rise since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
Still, most attorneys in this state say they file employment-discrimination cases in federal, rather than state, court.
Hardeep Rekhi, a Seattle attorney, recently won a lawsuit he filed on behalf of a Muslim man.
Are employers required to give employees days off for religious holidays, time to pray during work hours, or other religious accommodations?
Asegedew Gefe, one of the workers, is an Orthodox Christian, which is a form of Christianity practiced in Ethiopia and Egypt.
That was 15 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 created those rights at the federal level.
Should they give employees days off for religious holidays, or time to pray during work hours, for instance?
The lawsuit was brought by four employees of Gate Gourmet.
Asegedew Gefe, one of the workers, is an Orthodox Christian, a form of Christianity practiced in Ethiopia and Egypt.
She said state law does not require employers to allow for religious practices.
It might allow workers to sue smaller companies with as few as eight workers.
Only businesses with 25 people or more can be sued in federal cases.
While low in numbers, workplace complaints regarding religion have been on the rise since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
One was being required to work on a religious holiday.
The company prepares food for airline passengers.
But it is understood as being part of the law, they say.
Hardeep Rekhi, a Seattle lawyer, recently won a lawsuit he filed for a Muslim man.
The four men say the meals the company had been serving to the workers had pork in them.
This comes at a time when workers are increasingly expressing their religions in the workplace.
So most lawyers in the state file cases involving religion problems at work in national courts.
Rekhi filed the case in national court rather than state court.
Four years ago, Mary Visconti took an unconventional approach to keeping her North Lawndale students out of trouble.
Visconti rounded up donated skeins of yarn and plastic knitting needles, and she hired an art teacher.
"Part of our logic behind the lab was that they would form a community.
Shukurieya McClennon, 13, said it has helped her develop her own sense of style.
"I can just make them.
Students are allowed to keep one item each, and the rest are sold.
If they call in sick one day, they have to make the time up.
Students have learned to dye yarn vibrant colors with Kool-Aid, weave rugs with strips of ratty old T-shirts and "knit bomb" \u2014 knit around objects like chairs, handrails and bike racks \u2014 portions of the foundation\'s campus.
On a gloomy day last month, the students clustered around a folding table in the KnitLAB to create fiber scarves.
The room at the foundation is small, and boxes of donated yarn in a rainbow of colors crowd a massive bookshelf.
Knitting needles are stuffed haphazardly in vases and cups.

Market growth can be attributed in part to aggressive marketing, and in part to high adoption rates among high school students attracted to the variety of e-cig flavors, including cotton candy, gummy bear and root beer float.
Users inhale this flavored vapor and not combusted tobacco, which means e-cigs are safer relative to cigarettes.
Initial findings from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health indicate high levels of "dual use" of tobacco products, meaning that smokers frequently use both e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes.
These findings are consistent with other studies that have found that contrary to being cessation aids, e-cigarettes may actually make it harder for smokers to quit.
Nicotine is addictive and it is a poison \u2014 two facts that the FDA should make explicit by requiring warning labels on e-cigarette devices and vials of e-juices.
Dermal contact with even small quantities of liquid nicotine can cause dizziness, vomiting and seizures.
It is on the basis of these "what ifs" \u2014 however unlikely \u2014 that some support bans on the sale of e-cigarettes, or grossly high taxes on e-cigarettes, or outright bans on the use of e-cigarettes in public.
But such policies mean nicotine addicts will be less likely to use e-cigarettes, and relatively more likely to keep smoking tobacco.
Which means America should not treat e-cigarettes and vaping just like tobacco smoking and smoking, because smoking is far more dangerous than vaping.
In 2014, the Oxford English Dictionary\'s (OED) word of the year was "vape."
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should take a hint from the OED and write its own definition of e-cigarettes \u2014 a definition that will treat them as a tobacco product.
And herein lies the potential virtue of the e-cigarette: it could be a powerful tool for saving millions of lives if smokers switched from puffing to vaping to, ideally, nothing.
Over this half-century of cigarette regulation, two facts have been impressed upon the nation: 1) smoking tobacco kills people; 2) once a person is addicted to smoking cigarettes, or, rather, to the nicotine one ingests by smoking cigarettes, it is very hard for a person to quit.
He says e-cigarette regulation should take into account the "continuum of risk: that there are different nicotine-containing and nicotine-delivering products that pose different levels of risk to the individual," and regulate accordingly.
In fact, because vaping can cause people to voluntarily stop smoking, a carefully crafted regulatory policy that steers Americans from smoking toward vaping as a replacement provides "an extraordinary public health opportunity."
In short, the FDA was made to regulate products just like e-cigarettes.
"What if" vaping \u2014 inhaling water vapor through an e-cigarette \u2014 turns out to be harmful?
The director of the FDA\'s Center for Tobacco Products, Mitch Zeller, made the key point clear in an interview with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\'s New Public Health: "People are smoking for the nicotine, but dying from the tar."

How do they go about banning access to a product that saves lives?
The obvious and predictable result is relatively more tobacco smoking and thus, more illness and death.
And it is an industry that is booming.
The FDA should prohibit sales and marketing to kids and make sure that health claims made by e-cig companies are true.
Initial evidence from a major new study should give regulators pause.
These findings are consistent with other studies that have found that rather than helping people quit smoking, e-cigarettes may actually make it harder for smokers to quit.
Researchers at the University of California-San Francisco found that 95 percent of e-cig websites either made outright claims that they had health benefits, or implied there were some.
The report launched a "war on smoking" that soon required health warnings on cigarette packages and bans on cigarette commercials on radio and television.
They supply nicotine in much the same way as a tobacco cigarette, but without any apparent link to cancer or lung disease.
Finally there was a product that could help those who were addicted to cigarettes and for whom the available anti-smoking gum and patches had not been helpful.
Instead they may be more likely to keep smoking tobacco.

"What if" people who vape decide to start smoking?
Which means America should not treat e-cigarettes and vaping just like tobacco smoking and smoking.
The agency was created to help people know whether a product is safe, reliable and healthy.
Right now, more than 16 million children can legally buy e-cigarettes and give themselves as much nicotine as they want \u2014and nicotine is not harmless.
Accidentally drinking liquid nicotine has caused a huge increase in the number of cases reported to local poison control centers \u2014 including the death of a toddler in upstate New York two months ago.
They predict it will grow to $10 billion annually by 2017.
Yet, the other part of that growth is the growth in the number of high school students using them.
E-cigarettes should be regulated, not banned.
"Juice" sounds harmless, but it\'s misleading.
It is, in fact, a flavored nicotine mixture.
Users inhale this flavored vapor and not burning tobacco.
And herein lies the possible merit of the e-cigarette: it could be a powerful tool for saving millions of lives if smokers switched from puffing to vaping to, ideally, nothing.
Initial evidence from a major new study should cause regulators to stop and think.
The FDA should make both of these facts clear by requiring warning labels on e-cigarette devices and bottles of e-juices.
It looked at scientific evidence from more than 7,000 articles related to smoking and disease.
It soon required health warnings on cigarette packages and bans on cigarette commercials on radio and television.
And that horrible smell would be replaced with no smell at all \u2014 or the light scent of a flavor like mint or strawberry.
How can they want to ban the use of a product that saves lives?

At the time, food and drugs were awash in toxic dyes and preservatives.
The agency was created to help people know whether a product is safe and healthy.
The variety of e-cig flavors attract young people.
The FDA should prevent sales and advertising to kids.
Because burning tobacco releases thousands of chemicals, e-cigs are safer than cigarettes.
In recent years, it has led to bans on smoking in public places, like restaurants.
People who had tried other ways of quitting now had another anti-smoking aid to try.
Others want to add grossly high taxes on e-cigarettes to discourage people from using them.
The director of the FDA\'s Center for Tobacco Products, Mitch Zeller, made the key point clear: "People are smoking for the nicotine, but dying from the tar."

Because of that, we need carefully crafted rules.
If they are well-written to steer Americans from smoking toward vaping as a replacement, it will provide "an extraordinary public health opportunity," in Zeller\'s words.
They were seeking out birds that could survive a hotter planet.
The researchers were in the vanguard of food scientists, backed by millions of dollars from the federal government, racing to develop new breeds of farm animals that can stand up to the hazards of [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).
In agriculture, "we are dealing with the challenge of difficult weather conditions at the same time we have to massively increase food production" to accommodate larger populations and a growing demand for meat, said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.
"We have to start now to anticipate what changes we have to make in order to feed 9 billion people," he said, citing global-population estimates for 2050.
"It\'s a big problem when it happens," said Gale Strasburg, a professor of food science and human nutrition at Michigan State University, whose quest is to develop more robust turkeys.
"If we start seeing a lot more shifts in summer temperature extremes, there is going to be more of this," he said.
The hope is ultimately to enable industry to breed turkeys resilient to heat waves.
The scientists working to craft breeds of animals that can cope with a warmer climate argue that they, too, are focused on depleting fewer resources.
He pointed to the lack of feathers on its snaky, bare neck, which help it keep cool.
A few buildings away, some of his graduate students delicately place drops of chicken blood into test tubes as part of the gene mapping.
But Schmidt says where he hopes his work can be most beneficial is in increasing survival for backyard flocks in impoverished areas of Africa and South America.
The issue is helping these chickens or any animals survive in a state of increased heat stress."
"If the developing world runs into problems with food security," he said, "that affects everybody."
Some climate change activists dismiss the work, which is just getting under way.
The scientists, however, say that new breeds of farm animals, which can resist the heat, will be essential to feeding the world.
He added, "If we start seeing a lot more shifts in summer temperature extremes, there is going to be more of this."
So the only realistic way to reduce greenhouse gases may be to encourage people to eat less meat, they say.
Gates, the founder of Microsoft, is in favor of technology that would use pea proteins to create beef and chicken that looks like the real thing.
But Schmidt says where he hopes his work can be most beneficial is in increasing the chances of survival for chickens in poverty-stricken areas of Africa and South America.
Two years ago, a team of researchers traveled to Africa to search for chickens.
If the developing world doesn\'t have enough food, he said, "that affects everybody."
But in reality, the government would not actually shut down.
Prisoners would still be held in federal custody.
"Hundreds of thousands of government workers will not be working," said Brian Deese, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
The Obama administration told federal agencies last week to begin planning for a partial shutdown.
Managers have to decide which employees are essential and would be required to come to work and which are nonessential and would be sent home.
Lawmakers would do the same, but would decide who on their staffs was essential.
Taxes would be collected but judges would have to go home when the courts run out of funds.
For example, Anderson said, the OMB could determine that while the National Zoo must close, the workers who feed the animals must work.
Chris Edwards, a budget expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that if there is a positive outcome of a shutdown it could be that people may start thinking about which services the government provides are necessary and which should be permanently dropped.
Prisoners would still be held in federal jails.
He said the task of determining which employees are essential is difficult and keeps changing.

Until last week, Florida black bears were mostly a source of awe and amusement to their suburban neighbors.
The big lugs made repeated appearances in areas throughout Seminole County and other Central Florida communities, all of which made for fun Facebook posts and interesting coffee talk.
But no one had experienced a life-threatening injury because of a bear, and state wildlife experts regularly assured uneasy callers that the beasts would leave them alone if they just followed a few common-sense rules such as locking down their garbage.
All of that changed Dec. 2, when Susan Chalfant, a 54-year-old resident of Wingfield North near Wekiwa Springs State Park was mauled while walking her two small dogs on English Ivy Court.
In the wake of the attack, the agency plans to hire more wildlife contractors to trap and relocate bears or catch and kill them.
Bear hunting, which is not permitted in Florida, also is part of the management strategy in New Jersey, where hunters killed 287 bears in 2012.

Inga Bateman has considered it a privilege to live among the black bears that roam near her Longwood-area home \u2014 even if it has meant making a few life adjustments.
She planted thorny rose bushes to keep the mammals at a safe distance.
But no one came.
"I think we need to be looking for creative solutions on how to deal with these neighborhood bear situations," FWC\'s Wiley said.

State wildlife experts assured people that the beasts would leave them alone, if they followed some common sense rules.
He said his workers will kill a bear if it is showing the signs that it could be dangerous to humans.
The agency plans to hire more workers to trap and relocate bears, or to catch and kill them.
In other words,  "Are you willing to do a few things to help make sure that a bear doesn\'t get in trouble or cause problems for you?"
But after a bear charged Bateman twice while walking her dogs, she is feeling less carefree.
She even hit the bear on the nose with the door handle.
After she closed the door, the bear started pounding on windows.
But, no one came.
Wildlife scientists from New Jersey to Colorado have reported a jump in black bear complaints.
Large animals have wandered during daylight hours in parks where children play and along walking paths to schools.
Until last week, Florida black bears were a source of awe and fun to their neighbors.
But all of that changed on Dec. 2, when Susan Chalfant, 54, was badly hurt while walking her two small dogs.
She planted thorny rose bushes to keep the bears at a safe distance.
After she closed the door, the bear started pounding on windows.
Wiley has worked at the wildlife agency since 1988, and said the state\'s bear population was once "really in trouble."
New Jersey and Georgia allow bear hunting as a way to control bear populations.

She said she called 911.
Bateman, 56, said, "I want them to take it more seriously."
At the St. Paul Wal-Mart store last week, she debated between a black-satin sequined cat mask vs. a leopard-festooned mask (with matching kitty tail).
Both bore a price tag of about $5, and she plans on spending another $5 on makeup to complete her feline party look.
And, despite early indications of shopper gloominess, 158 million consumers plan to celebrate Halloween in some manner this year \u2014 the most popular activity, of course, will be doling out candy.
A survey distributed recently by the NRF indicates that nearly 9 in 10 people plan to spend less on candy, costumes and decorations this Halloween season compared with last year.
About a quarter of the 5,200-plus consumers surveyed cited the economy as the main reason for the decline.
Plus, smaller pleasures, including spider-web earrings and people paints, are hot this season.
For retailers, Halloween is an important revenue bridge between the crucial back-to-school and Christmas buying seasons.
"Halloween is one of the most popular holidays of the year, and while we are expecting people to cut back on their spending a bit this Halloween, there\'s no sense it will be a bust," said Kathy Grannis, a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation.

Not all retailers are reporting Halloween-spending skittishness.
Consumers are expected to spend $330 million on pet costumes.
Time to get dressed up to celebrate Halloween, right?
But the U.S. economy is not doing as well as people would like, and that has some shoppers spooked.

A king penguin who feels threatened can shuffle away even while keeping its egg or baby chick balanced on its feet.
Perhaps future robots could even be outfitted to follow around swimming and flying critters as well.
"When the rover was camouflaged with a penguin model, all adult and chick emperor penguins allowed it to approach close enough for an electronic identification," the authors wrote.

Perhaps future robots could even be outfitted to follow around swimming and flying critters as well.
A team led by scientists from the University of Strasbourg in France have built a robot that resembles a fluffy penguin chick.
When studying animals in the wild, it may be better for humans to get out of the way and let robots do the work.
When the penguins shuffle away, they migrate into the spaces of other nearby penguins.
Of the 158 birds that were tested with the robot, 28 percent "reacted with alertness," 47 percent did not seem to react at all, and 25 percent were intrigued by the rover and came closer to check it out.
The adorable robotic spy was even more successful than its plain-looking robot predecessor.

A Peking duck dinner might inspire a pang of guilt about indulging in some decadent, fatty fowl.
But health-minded diners at the high-end Da Dong restaurant chain here in the Chinese capital can at least tell themselves they did a little weightlifting before their meal.
And diners are handed two other menus: a selection of seasonal items running 24 pages and a relatively thin wine list of 19 pages.
In China, however, high-end eateries have been supersizing.
Countless run-of-the-mill restaurants offer customers menus as large and colorful as American high school yearbooks.
Chinese cooking is very varied, and also very flexible.
In addition, low labor costs in comparison with the West make it easier to have more cooks in the kitchen.
Typically, dinner party hosts show their generosity by ordering lavishly.
Dong Zhenxiang, the chef behind the 600-seat Da Dong, says he started adding photos to his menu in the early 1990s.
"Even I, as a professional chef, it\'s taken me years to realize why some dishes have their names."
As his menu grew more elaborate, Dong found himself in a predicament: Customers were pinching them at a pace that made running his restaurants difficult.
Now, his mega-menus are made once a year at a top printing house in Shenzhen, and theft is way down \u2014 their sheer size makes them difficult to steal.

At a small community park in Santa Monica, a group of Los Angeles-area musicians wearing dark blue and orange T-shirts with the slogan "Listen Up!"
"Make no mistake, music that we produce is a critical component in the artistic and financial success of any film that\'s produced here," said Neil Samples, a violinist.
After his speech, a zydeco band took the stage, and Samples and his colleagues huddled into a van and drove a few blocks to the headquarters of Lionsgate, the independent studio behind the hit "Hunger Games" movies.
The American Federation of Musicians has previously organized rallies against Marvel Studios for hiring London musicians to work on such movies as "The Avengers" and "Iron Man 3" even though those films were shot in the United States.
It says the studio is hiring foreign musicians to play music on movies that were filmed in the United States with the support of taxpayer subsidies.
It has cited such Lionsgate releases as "The Hunger Games" and "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn", which were scored in London, and the recently released "Draft Day".
"One of the fantastic things about being a musician in LA is that you\'re surrounded by just an astonishing level of players," said Marc Sazer, a violinist for the Pasadena Symphony who has worked in the recording industry since the 1980s.
For example, musicians in Macedonia might get paid only $10 to $15 an hour and not receive any contributions to health and pension plans, compared with $75 an hour plus those benefits in Los Angeles.
But unlike other studios, Lionsgate does not have an overall agreement with the union that would require it to score music in the United States if it shoots the movie or TV show domestically.
"Make no mistake, music that we produce is a critical component in the artistic and financial success of any film that\'s produced here," said Neil Samples, a violinist.
The Kevin Costner movie about the NFL draft was filmed in Ohio, where the production received tax benefits, but was scored in Macedonia.
On any given day, about 2,000 members of AFM Local 47 will work on a film or TV show.

The number of movie scoring jobs has declined at least 50 percent in the last five years, according to the union.
"They are highly profitable, and they can afford to meet the industry standards," he said.

"Space is what I do for work, and that\'s what I think about it: It\'s my work," Serova said in a NASA interview before launch in late September.
But before the 38-year-old engineer climbed aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket, Russian reporters asked if she was taking makeup with her and wondered how she would wear her hair during her six-month mission.
As for her hairdo, she shot back: "I have a question for you \u2014 why don\'t you ask the question about Alexander\'s hair, for example," she said, referring to crewmate Alexander Samokutyaev seated next to her at the news conference.
Serova is one of only four Russian women to fly in space and the first to live at this space station.
It turns out that women tend to suffer more faintness when trying to stand upon immediate return to Earth and more vertigo, according to the report, and they appear to lose more blood plasma during spaceflight.

"Part of what I hoped at the beginning was that it would be mostly one thing that was wrong," said Brad Hanson, a whale expert with the fisheries center.
New rules require boaters and whale-watching ships to stay 200 yards from whales.
The northern killer whale population has tripled to nearly 300 since the 1960s.

In the last 10 years, scientists have figured out where orcas go in winter.
In one sense, scientists already know.
New whale discoveries show that orcas face complicated dangers.
In the early 1960s, there were 140 killer whales in Puget Sound near the Pacific Ocean.
But as of last year, only 82 orcas remain.
And they are disturbed by noise from boats.
They also slap their tails more and hunt less.
The sky is cloudless and blue in this coastal community of bungalows by the sea.
Seconds later, viewers watching the show live on TV saw a scary graphic of a gazebo battered by wind and rain.
The station proclaimed itself Hurricane Central.
Helped by a steady string of blizzards, tropical storms, hurricanes and tornadoes, the cable channel has increased its revenue while some other media outlets have struggled.
That decision upset meteorologists and the National Weather Service, which is responsible for naming hurricanes.
Its coverage of what it dubbed "Nemo," the snowstorm that blanketed much of the East Coast in February, featured all-caps headlines such as "YOU MUST PREPARE NOW."
The gossip site Gawker poked fun with an article headlined "Snow Panic Has Driven Weather.com Completely Insane."
It has also beefed up its website with feature stories and photo galleries that are only slightly weather-related ("Before the Bikini: Rare Vintage Beach Photos").
Since then the Weather Channel started airing more reality shows and television programs such as "Deadliest Space Weather" and "Forecasting the End."
"Forecasting the End" is about how "catastrophic weather or natural disasters could possibly cause the end of days."
It promoted itself as a necessity for viewers trying to plan their days who wanted to know what kind of weather they might encounter.
But as people use websites and mobile apps for their daily forecasts, the Weather Channel had to give viewers something different, said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group.
"There\'s a lot of anecdotal evidence that certain stations put a guy on the beach to get good visuals, but it\'s not necessarily the smartest thing to do," said Jeffrey Lazo, an economist who studies the public\'s demand for weather forecasts.

One of the most broadcast songs of the 20th century, Ben E. King\'s "Stand by Me," has been selected for preservation at the Library of Congress, along with recordings from Joan Baez, The Righteous Brothers, Steve Martin and the darker sounds of the band Radiohead.
The Library of Congress has been seeking to preserve important sound recordings for 15 years under terms of a preservation act passed by Congress.
A few years later, The Righteous Brothers were recording "Lovin\' Feelin\'."
They thought the song was wrong for them at first but ended up with a hit.
Other historic recordings chosen for preservation include radio coverage of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\'s funeral in 1945 and the 1953 theatrical recording of "John Brown\'s Body," based on a Civil War poem that proved to be commercially successful as a non-musical play.

Upon hearing that his record has been declared archive-worthy, Martin deadpanned: "I could not be more proud of this honor \u2014 this means the record was probably funny."
Wax cylinders were played on phonographs, which came before record players.
The wax cylinders to be preserved were recorded by average Americans in the 1890s, 1900s and 1910s as snapshots of everyday life.
Based on a Civil War poem, "John Brown\'s Body" proved to be commercially successful as a non-musical play.
Curators also decided that some more recent recordings were worthy of preservation, including tunes from TV\'s "Sesame Street."

The doctors and therapists who worked with a little girl from Afghanistan knew the prosthetic arm they gave her would change her life.
Soon there were shades of blue, green and bright orange laid out across little stickers of fish, bunnies, a flower and sky that Whaley had showed her how to place on the board beforehand.
But Whaley quickly assured her that accidental art sometimes makes the best abstract art.
"You\'re going to do a Jackson Pollock," he quipped.
Their village had been a cauldron of violence since the Afghan war began.
"There was what looked like a rock that she picked up and threw on the ground and it exploded," said Ilaha Omar, a Children of War Foundation member who brought her to the United States, where Shriners Hospital treated her for free.
But she quickly warmed to the people around her and impressed them with how quickly she learned how to use it.
And also a few selfies to take back home.
But before heading home to her host family and then Afghanistan there was still some unfinished business.

Then, before her teacher could fetch it, she grabbed it with her new prosthetic hand.
She had accidentally squeezed a tube of orange paint onto the painting rather than the palette.
But Whaley quickly told her that accidental art sometimes makes the best abstract art.
The finished result "was pretty mind-blowing," the artist said afterward.

As part of the settlement, Apple also must change its billing practices to make it more obvious that a purchase is taking place during the course of the game or app.
Apple has taken a series of steps in recent years to ensure its app store is a "safe place for customers of all ages," he said in a memo sent to company employees Wednesday.
Others consumers reported unauthorized purchases by children totaling more than $500 in the apps "Dragon Story" and "Tiny Zoo Friends."
Apple says its customers spent more than $10 billion on app transactions last year.
That figure includes the price charged by some apps for the software, as well as revenue from purchases while playing a game or for some other extra service.
Jackie Nussbaum knew her son liked playing DragonVale on the family iPad \u2014 a colorful game with soothing music and chirping birds where kids raise adorable baby dragons.
"I thought it was a mistake, that someone had stolen my credit card," said Nussbaum, a mother of two children in Westerville, Ohio.
"You cannot charge consumers for purchases they did not authorize," said Edith Ramirez, the commission chairwoman.
One parent told the FTC her daughter had spent $2,600 in "Tap Pet Hotel," in which children can build their own pet lodging.
The FTC settlement addresses the same issue raised in a class-action lawsuit that Apple resolved last year.

Nussbaum said Andrew, who was 10 at the time, had no idea he was buying gems with "real money."
He felt so bad, she said, he was going to sell his old toys to pay her back.
Apple says its customers spent more than $10 billion on app transactions last year.
When Jackie Nussbaum opened her credit card statement, she saw a bunch of charges from Apple, totaling $600 in one day.
"I thought it was a mistake, that someone had stolen my credit card," said Nussbaum, the mother of two children in Westerville, Ohio.
Apple CEO Tim Cook said the Cupertino, Calif.-based company gave in to the FTC because the agreement reached by Apple and the FTC "does not require us to do anything we weren\'t already going to do.
Nussbaum also said Apple helped her set up password protections for in-app purchases.
Double jeopardy, which is illegal, is trying someone in court twice for the same crime.

The mosquito that carries the dengue virus has spread to 100 countries and potentially exposes 2.5 billion people to the excruciating disease, also known as bonebreak fever.
Teams patrol the streets fumigating with insecticide in a constant battle against the mosquito, and public service ads remind Panamanians to drain standing water in eaves, buckets, flowerpots and old tires, where mosquitoes breed.
"We plan to do about 50,000 per week," said Dr. Nestor Sosa, the head of the Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies, an autonomous public research body.
Hadyn Parry, the chief executive of Oxitec, said in a telephone interview that his company thought its transgenic mosquito was safer than using insecticides, which he asserted "affect all insects in a given area" and can filter through the ecosystem and persist.
The transgenic mosquitoes have generated opposition, with complaints ranging from doubts about their effectiveness to concern about whether the impact on the ecosystem has been adequately studied.
Another critic, Camilo Rodriguez-Beltran, a French-trained biosecurity expert working in Chile, said the gene-altered mosquitoes could cross international boundaries, violating international treaties on biosafety.
A Panamanian environmental lawyer, Olmedo Carrasquilla, said his nation should use better techniques to educate the public on mosquito control.

The dead-end mosquitoes only affect one species, he said.
Panama has one of the most developed public-health systems in Latin America.
Scientists have created a new type of mosquito that might help in the fight against a terrible disease called dengue fever.
Panama is one of the countries that may use them to try to get rid of mosquitoes that carry the deadly disease, while other countries are also doing tests.
Some 50 million to 100 million people come down with dengue each year, health officials say.
This has been a particularly bad year for dengue in the Western Hemisphere.
If Panamanian officials say it is okay, sometime early next year technicians will release tens of thousands of the mosquitoes in Arraijan.
Basic methods to control mosquitoes work, he said.
Mosquitoes live for about three weeks and they generally spend that time in an area 200 yards from where they were born.
Yosemite High School once offered six woodshop classes.
Campus enrollment is down from 1,100 five years ago to about 700 today.
Though the local Chinese cuisine is not to their satisfaction, they appreciate the clean air and the elbow room.
In looking abroad to fill seats, Yosemite is following the lead of underpopulated high schools in Maine and upstate New York, among other places.
"Because there\'s so much money that can be made, and because there\'s a lack of regulation, you\'re just going to see a lot of people rushing into this field driven by profit rather than the desire to provide students and schools with a quality experience," said Jay Chen, president of the Hacienda La Puente Unified school board.

At a time when so much may seem uncertain, the people of Ferguson can have confidence that the Justice Department intends to learn \u2014 in a fair and thorough manner \u2014 exactly what happened.
On Wednesday, I was in Ferguson to be briefed on the federal civil rights investigation that I have closely monitored since I launched it more than one week ago.
We understand the need for an independent investigation, and we hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm to the tensions in Ferguson.
Although these acts have been committed by a very small minority \u2014 and, in many cases, by individuals from outside Ferguson \u2014 they seriously undermine, rather than advance, the cause of justice.
And they interrupt the deeper conversation that the legitimate demonstrators are trying to advance.
Enforcement priorities and arrest patterns must not lead to disparate treatment under the law, even if such treatment is unintended.
Constructive dialogue should continue \u2014 but it must also be converted into concrete action.
And it is painfully clear, in cities and circumstances across our great nation, that more progress, more dialogue, and more action are needed.
This is my pledge to the people of Ferguson: Our investigation into this matter will be full, it will be fair, and it will be independent.
And beyond the investigation itself, we will work with the police, civil rights leaders, and members of the public to ensure that this tragedy can give rise to new understanding \u2014 and robust action \u2014 aimed at bridging persistent gaps between law enforcement officials and the communities we serve.
Long after the events of Aug. 9 have receded from the headlines, the Justice Department will continue to stand with this community.
In research published this week in the journal Antiquity, scholars wrote that the evidence supports a 6th century BC nativity for the Buddha.
According to Buddhist tradition, Siddhartha Gautama, as he was known before enlightenment, was born in a garden, beneath a tree.
Coningham said that because of this tradition, it was not surprising that a tree would feature prominently in the shrine.
"This is one of those rare occasions when belief, tradition, archeology and science actually come together, because here we have a very early shrine built around a tree," Coningham said.
The Lumbini temple is one of four key temples associated with the life of Buddha, or "enlightened one."
The first Lumbini shrine was likely built by wealthy adherents of Buddhism at a time when the religion was considered a cult.
Subsequent shrines were constructed with large open areas as well, researchers said.
At some point the temple was forgotten and overgrown by jungle.
Coningham said that because of this tradition, it was not surprising that a tree would feature prominently in the shrine.
It was rediscovered in 1869 and found to have a large sandstone column with an inscription that called the site Lumbini and said that Ashoka had visited there.
It had never been covered by a roof," Coningham said.
Ancient bricks, tile roofing and wood charcoal discovered beneath a site in Nepal where monks, nuns and pilgrims visit to honor Buddha are providing new evidence for when he might have been born.

The Lumbini temple is one of four key temples associated with the life of Buddha.
Later shrines were constructed with large open areas as well, researchers said.
Historians have often thought he was born between 623 B.C.
New evidence found in Nepal may provide a better answer for the question of when the Buddha was born, according to archaeologists.
The Lumbini temple is one of four important temples associated with the life of Buddha.
He got the name of Buddha when he reached a great level of knowledge and wisdom, which was known as his enlightenment.
Hundreds of thousands of nuns, monks and other pilgrims visit Lumbini each year to pay respect to the Buddha.
And the temple remained open as archaeologists did their work.
It was rediscovered in 1869.
Historians have thought that the Buddha could have been born anywhere between 623 B.C.
Also, the team found pieces of tree roots that had been preserved.

Bradley Manning to 35 years in a military prison Wednesday, Aug. 21 for orchestrating the largest-ever leak of classified U.S. documents.
Lind found Manning guilty in July of 20 counts relating to the theft of an estimated 700,000 documents.
The theft ranged from diplomatic communications and intelligence assessments to a graphic video of a U.S. Apache helicopter attack.
Defense attorney David Coombs had urged Lind to impose a sentence that allowed Manning to "have a life" when he left prison.
Manning can apply for parole after serving one-third of his sentence.
"I am sorry for the unintended consequences of my actions," Manning told Lind during a sentencing hearing on Aug. 14.
But prosecutors charged him with additional crimes, including espionage.
To shape her sentencing decision, Lind heard testimony from witnesses in both closed and open court sessions.
State Department officials testified about the consequences of having 250,000 department documents being made public.
The sentence means the 25-year-old former intelligence analyst could eventually walk out of prison as a free man.

People are more likely to get sick or hurt on older rides than on newer ones.
And about 1 in 8 accident reports, as they are called, are about riders who were hurt while getting on or off.
In all, the newspaper looked at 2,089 injury reports filed in 2007 through 2012 with the state Department of Industrial Relations.
The largest category of reports, about 18 percent, was related to motion sickness, including fainting, nausea and dizziness.
Back and neck pain ranked second, at 16 percent, followed by head injuries at 12 percent.
Operators of permanent theme park rides must file an accident report when a visitor is injured or feels sick and then receives outside medical help.
By comparison, the odds of being injured in the bathroom \u2014 and requiring a visit to the hospital \u2014 are about 1 in 1,037 in a given year.
The age of Space Mountain, which opened in 1977, may also be a factor in its injury rate.

The act of walking may not seem like a feat of agility, balance, strength and brainpower.
A report published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine describes how the team fit Vawter with a prosthetic leg that has learned \u2014 with the help of a computer and some electrodes \u2014 to read his intentions from a bundle of nerves that end above his missing knee.
If he wants his artificial toes to curl toward him, or his artificial ankle to shift so he can walk down a ramp, all he has to do is imagine such movements.
Most prosthetics in use today require the physical turn of a key to transition from one movement to another.
Before Vawter could strap on the bionic lower limb, engineers in Chicago had to "teach" the prosthetic how to read his motor intentions from tiny muscle contractions in his right thigh.
In most amputations, the nerves in the thigh are left to languish or die.
When Vawter thought about flexing his right foot in a particular way, the rerouted nerve endings would consistently cause a distinctive contraction in his hamstring.
When he pondered how he would position his foot on a stair step and ready it for the weight of his body, the muscle contraction would be elsewhere \u2014 but equally consistent.
Vawter said he had "fallen down a whole bunch of times" while wearing his everyday prosthetic, but not once while moving around on his bionic leg.
The act of walking may not seem like a feat of agility, balance, strength and brainpower.
There isn\'t anything special I have to do to make it work right."

President George W. Bush signed the 2002 provisions into law but noted that "U.S. policy regarding Jerusalem has not changed."
U.S. passports are documents issued by the government that allow U.S. citizens to travel to other countries.
In 2002, Congress passed a law that allowed Americans born in Jerusalem to list their birthplace as Israel on their U.S. passports.
There are nine judges, or justices, on the Supreme Court.
"A delicate subject lies in the background of this case," Justice Kennedy noted on Monday.

Alberta Currie, the great-granddaughter of slaves, was born in a farmhouse surrounded by tobacco and cotton fields.
No birth certificate was issued; a birth announcement was handwritten into the Currie family Bible.
Under a restrictive new voter ID law in North Carolina, a state-issued photo ID is required for voting as of the 2016 election.
Currie has spent three years trying, without success, to persuade officials to issue her a birth certificate.
"They\'re trying to make it as hard as possible for people like me to vote," Currie said at her brick home in the red clay farming country of southern-central North Carolina.
Republicans have enacted similar voter ID laws in at least 11 states since 2011, including Texas.
"Jim Crow was very ugly about what he did," Jeremy Collins, a lawyer with the Southern Coalition, told Currie in her home as her twin daughters, Brenda and Linda, 57, nodded in agreement.
In part because of early voting and same-day registration, North Carolina rose from 47th in voter participation in 1991 to 11th in 2012, according to Christensen.

But at least seven of the 45 states that adopted the standards are fighting to restore the cursive instruction.
"Modern research indicates that more areas of the human brain are engaged when children use cursive handwriting than when they keyboard," said Bateman, who handwrites 125 ornate letters each year.
Cursive advocates cite recent brain science that indicates the fluid motion employed when writing script enhances hand-eye coordination and develops fine motor skills, in turn promoting reading, writing and cognition skills.
Some 95 percent of teens use the Internet, and the percentage using smartphones to go online has grown from 23 percent in 2011 to 37 percent today, according to the Pew Research Center.
Pew surveys of teens have found many prefer to write on the computer, which they found faster and neater, but many still use handwriting for notes, letters, journals, short stories or music lyrics \u2014 as well as for school.
"Jack assured me that he is going to work to make at least one letter legible in order not to debase our currency," the president joked at the time.

Linden Bateman and his pen are fighting to keep cursive writing, or script, in American classrooms.
"Modern research indicates that more areas of the human brain are engaged when children use cursive handwriting than when they keyboard," said Bateman, who handwrites 125 letters each year.
States that adopted Common Core are allowed to offer courses that were omitted from the list of preferred offerings.
But in many schools these days, classroom time is limited and the pressure to perform well on standardized tests is high.
Cursive advocates point to recent brain science: Research indicates that the fluid motion employed when writing script enhances hand-eye coordination and develops fine motor skills.
This in turn promotes reading, writing and thinking skills.
People their age have moved increasingly from handwriting to computers.
The percentage using smartphones to go online has grown from 23 percent in 2011 to 37 percent today, according to the Pew Research Center.
Despite those results, says researcher Kristen Purcell, most teachers "encourage their students to do at least some of their writing by hand."
"I find it hard to think creatively when I am typing," a high school boy from the Pacific Northwest told Pew in 2008.
"Jack assured me that he is going to work to make at least one letter legible" in order not to devalue our currency, the president joked at the time.
In this digital-heavy age, there is an increasing need for children to master computer keyboarding.
And there is evidence that even most adults do not use classic cursive in everyday life.
But many still use handwriting for notes, letters, journals, short stories or music lyrics \u2014 as well as for school.

Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, along with an Egyptian and a couple of Georgians, also have featured prominently this year.
This is partly the result of a general trend away from rigid traditions \u2014 the numbers of heavily made-up geisha also are plummeting \u2014 and the life of a professional sumo wrestler is particularly tough.
"Sumo is not a familiar sport compared to others like soccer and baseball," said Kento Nakazawa of the Japan Sumo Association, who organizes a children\'s sumo class every year.
Toshiyo Abe sat on the tatami mats watching his son Shotaro, a 6-year-old missing a front tooth, wrestle older boys.
Shotaro asked to start sumo a year ago after seeing it at one of the introductory tournaments, so now they travel an hour by train to the dojo every Saturday and Sunday.
Some parents, however, balk at a crucial part of getting ahead in sumo: being heavy.
"Some high school clubs make you eat until you throw up, but some clubs just leave it to you to bulk up," said Akiteru Kiyomiya as he watched his sons, 13-year-old Itto and 10-year-old Kenshi, train.
After the four-hour training session, Shinju Taira, a former professional wrestler who now coaches at the dojo, said he worried about the decline of sumo both as a sport and as a part of a culture.
Viktor Hluben hauled a 14-foot great hammerhead shark into the surf after a tricky nighttime battle from a South Florida beach.
The agency wrote only five tickets for possession of protected shark species last year.
"If you do happen to catch something that big, you don\'t want to go into chest-deep water to unhook it.
Everyone wants to shoot a video that they can put on YouTube.
Well, it may not be quick enough for some of these species like the hammerhead."
Viktor Hluben hauled a 14-foot great hammerhead shark into the surf after a tricky nighttime battle from a South Florida beach.
This is like basically holding you under the water and doing things with you while you hold your breath.
South Florida fisherman Viktor Hluben pulls in his catch after a hard fight.
A group of friends drag the big fish onto a beach by the tail.
Then they cut the fishing line and haul the bloody shark into waist-deep water.
Videos of land-based fishers catching hammerheads and other sharks are becoming more popular.
Fishers are not supposed to take pictures before they let the animals go, said Shiffman.
Three of those were from a single enforcement stop, spokeswoman Amanda Nalley said.
Hammerheads can still die after long fights.
Cheering families, some on sun loungers, drinking cocktails and waving Norwegian flags, donned shades as the sun crept from behind a cloud to hit the mirrors and reflect down onto the faces of delighted children below.
Like much of Scandinavia, the town of Rjukan often is freezing throughout the winter, but on Wednesday it was 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius) there.
The story of how 12 Norwegian saboteurs parachuted into the nearby tundra and survived freezing temperatures to destroy the factory\'s "heavy water" plant inspired a 1965 Hollywood film, "The Heroes of Telemark," and is being turned into a 10-part TV series by Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle.
The century-old idea was revived in 2005 by Martin Andersen, an artist and resident of the town, who helped raise the sponsorship money.
Residents of the small Norwegian town of Rjukan have finally seen the light.
A band encouraged a cloud that weakened the effect to move away with the song, "Let The Sunshine In."
TV footage of the event showed the center of the crowded square light up like a touch.
The mirrors were helicoptered in and installed 1,500 feet above the town square.
They are more commonly used to create solar power in sundrenched regions of the Middle East.
Zoo spokeswoman Tracy Gray issued a statement defending the use of dogs, saying it was part of "providing the best care possible for our African elephants."
Gray added, "The primary reason the herding dogs are working with our team is for the safety of our staff.
The USDA ruled that the exhibit did not have sufficient distance and barriers between the animals and the general public.
In July 1989, a keeper suffered a broken leg, cuts and bruises when an elephant kicked him as he was about to give it medicine.
In November 2002, handler Mike Gatti, 46, was killed when a mother elephant pushed her head on his chest after he fell to the ground.
Still, Gray said the zoo stands by its handling of elephants.

People die about 5.5 years earlier in northern China than in the south, and heavy air pollution is almost entirely to blame, a new study has determined.
This information was then compared with mortality data collected at 145 locations across the country from 1991 to 2000.
This new research, however, specifically shows that pollution does lower life expectancy.
In China, the researchers found an ideal place to examine the effects of air pollution.
For undetermined reasons, previous Chinese governments gave people north of the river free coal to burn in winter.
This decision effectively created two experimental groups on either side of the river that could be compared with each other.
Air pollution is calculated by total suspended particulates (TSPs).
The researchers estimated that 500 million residents of northern China in the 1990s collectively lost 2.5 billion years from their lives.
Another co-author, Yuyu Chen of Peking University in Beijing, said: "It\'s a huge loss.
The pollution closed highways, forced the cancellations of airline flights and outdoor activities, and sent countless people to hospitals.
Another spell of terrible air besieged the Chinese capital in late June.
In June, the government announced a package of 10 anti-pollution measures.
Heavy polluters are being asked to reduce their emissions by 30 percent by the end of 2017.
Chen noted that Chinese citizens would be willing to give up some financial development in order to prolong their lives.
The researcher concluded that the public would forgo up to 2 percentage points of economic growth to reduce TSPs by 100 micrograms per cubic meter.
Azucena Lozoya, 16, said she signed up for the gardening program because she never had a chance to try anything like it where she lives.
KAR, Senegal - President Barack Obama arrived in this corner of West Africa to deliver messages about civil society and responsible leadership, democracy and development.
The greeting was plastered on signs and T-shirts wherever Obama went Thursday during his first full day of a weeklong, three-country trip to Africa.
Although Obama was born and largely raised in Hawaii, his father was born and is buried in Kenya.
It is said that men, women and children were traded, sorted, weighed and put in chains there before being sent across the Atlantic to the Americas.
However, the president described the visit as a meaningful experience.
He said it was especially powerful for his family "to be able to come here and to fully appreciate the magnitude of the slave trade, to get a sense in a very intimate way of the incredible inhumanity and hardship that people faced before they made the Middle Passage and that crossing."

Lampposts were covered with signs reading, "Welcome home, Mr.
Crowds of people danced and waved.
The president spent about half an hour in the two-story salmon-colored house filled with dark holding cells.
"Obviously, for an African-American \u2014 and an African-American president \u2014 to be able to visit this site, I think, gives me even greater motivation in terms of the defense of human rights around the world," Obama said afterward.
But the Obamas were the first to make the visit with the knowledge that their ancestors had experienced such cruelty.

Nearly 3.2 million people have been forced to leave their homes since fighters from the Islamic State group began to seize Iraqi territory early last year \u2014 the fastest-growing displacement crisis in the world.
Now, Iraqis in the capital have lived through a decade of near-daily car bombs, more than a quarter of the country is controlled by the Islamic State, and a fall in oil prices is causing an economic crisis.
"I think about my country, and how it needs people like me," he said, adding that five of his friends have also left.
"There are thousands like me that are leaving.
In a camp for displaced families from Anbar in the Iraqi capital, the Obaid family say they lost everything when they were forced to flee their home in Fallujah at the beginning of 2014, when the Islamic State seized control.
"I\'d tear up my identity card right now for the chance to go to Europe," said her son, Arkan Naji Obaid, 37, who was disabled after an American airstrike hit his house in 2003.
Mohammed Falah says that his life is not so bad.
The United Nations states that more than 50,000 Iraqis have left the country, just in the past three months.
Nearly 3.2 million people have been forced out of their homes since fighters from the Islamic State group began to seize Iraqi territory early last year.
"I saw this wave of young people who were going, many of my friends going, and I saw this as a chance," said Falah, who hopes to eventually make it to Germany.
Jassim was at the top of his class when he graduated from college two years ago, but has struggled since to find a job, and now works at a car wash.

Thirty-seven-year-old Arkan Naji Obaid and his mother are in a camp for displaced families in Baghdad.
Now, they cannot afford to leave the country.
Obaid continued, "If people had the money to go, this camp would be empty."
The Costa Concordia is set to be removed from the shoreline of the Italian island of Giglio by mid-2014, experts said Tuesday, after the wrecked cruise liner was successfully pried from the rocks it had been wedged against for the last 20 months.
The operation to straighten the 300-meter, 114,000-ton vessel by 65 degrees took 19 hours.
The listing hull was lifted using steel cables and tanks attached to its exposed side, which were filled with water and used as counterweights in the effort to pull up the wreck, which was rested on a false seabed.
Engineers were next planning to inspect the side that emerged from the waters, which was covered in brown mud and was heavily deformed.
The idea is to attach tanks also on that side, and use them to refloat the ship by emptying them of water and filling them with air.
Once refloated, the Concordia was expected to be towed away to a yet-to-be decided port for dismantling, but Franco Porcellacchia, an engineer overseeing operations for owners Costa Crociere, was confident it could all be done in the first half of next year.
Work cannot be done faster because of the difficulty of operating during adverse winter conditions.
The risk was that the rusting hull could snap or sink entirely, jeopardizing the entire salvage operation and causing a likely environmental disaster.
The sinking of the Concordia, attributed to the irresponsible behavior of its Italian captain Francesco Schettino, has been a national shame.
The Costa Concordia is set to be removed from the shoreline of the Italian island of Giglio by mid-2014, experts said Tuesday, after the wrecked cruise liner was successfully pried from the rocks it had been wedged against for the last 20 months.
All those working on the rescue "are a great (source) of Italian pride," Prime Minister Enrico Letta wrote on Twitter.
He invited Gabrielli and others for a congratulatory meeting in Rome.
Rescuers were expected to board the vessel to look for their remains.
He left the Concordia before all passengers had been evacuated.

"(Felipe) is mature, well-prepared and has the sense of responsibility necessary to become head of state and launch a new stage of hope," Juan Carlos said.
But there have also been clouds for the monarch, who has reigned since 1975.
His relaxed style was counterbalanced by that of his more formal wife, Greek-born Queen Sofia.
Separatist groups across the country have long targeted the monarch as a symbol of a country to which they do not want to belong.
There were also diplomatic missteps, such as the infamous 2007 exchange between the king and former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who had just called Juan Carlos a fascist.
He was said to know something that every royal family should remember: that kings are not born, but made by the people.
The presiding judge did not sentence Morsi in that case, postponing a final verdict until next month.
El-Sissi then presided over a widespread crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and other dissidents who opposed his rule.
Morsi and his co-defendants were also accused of "looting poultry and livestock" from prison grounds.
"Today will be remembered as one of the darkest days" in Egypt\'s history, Amr Darrag, a senior Brotherhood official and former member of Morsi\'s cabinet, said in an email.
Morsi arrived smiling and wearing a blue prison uniform.
On Saturday a Cairo court sentenced former Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi to death.
More than 100 other people were accused, most of whom are not in Egyptian custody, and were also sentenced to death on the same charges.
They were accused of leaking state secrets to Iran while Morsi was in power.
As the verdict was read, Morsi and the other defendants chanted against the military.

"We join as one people to honor a debt we can never fully repay," President Barack Obama said at Arlington National Cemetery.
Among the ceremonies around the nation was one for two of the original Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African-American aviators in World War II.
The usual 21-gun artillery salute was fired and the president was joined by representatives of all of the services: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard.
It was set up to remember the end of World War I.
Veterans Day was designed to remember all those who served in the military while Memorial Day, at the end of May, remembers those who died while serving.
The military increasingly has become a career, so it is not uncommon for soldiers to have served in more than one conflict.
According to the government, 14.7 million veterans voted in the 2012 presidential election, a relatively large turnout of 70 percent.
In 1948, President Harry Truman officially ended discrimination in the armed forces.
"This is the life of one American veteran, living proud and strong in the land he helped keep free," Obama said during proceedings at Arlington.
The day known as Veterans Day began as Armistice Day on Nov. 11, 1919.
Congress created an annual observance in 1926 and Nov. 11 became a national holiday in 1939.
They were called the Bonus Army and wanted bonuses promised to them in certificates issued by the government.

Under pressure from Congress and international allies, President Barack Obama announced a change in what has been a central piece of his counterterrorism strategy, saying he would place new restrictions on the targeting of terrorists with missiles fired from [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone).
But a newly codified rule book, administration officials said, would hold U.S. authorities to a tougher standard when deciding whom to kill, where, and under what circumstances.
"To say a military tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance," Obama said in his address at the National Defense University.
His administration has faced skepticism from Congress, which has held a series of hearings on targeting killing.
That means less reason to hit massed groups in Pakistan under a tactic known a "signature strikes," where the CIA fired missiles at groups of suspected militants whose identities were unknown.
Obama spoke to that issue obliquely, saying, "In the Afghan war theater, we must support our troops until the transition is complete at the end of 2014.
That means we will continue to take strikes against high-value al-Qaida targets, but also against forces that are massing to support attacks on coalition forces.
In Yemen, where the CIA and the military have launched numerous drone strikes, a new pro-American government is making progress against the al-Qaida affiliate, U.S. officials said, and that is making U.S. drone strikes less crucial.

President Barack Obama announced Thursday he would limit the use of drones in targeting terrorists.
Under the old rules, anyone who was considered a "significant threat" could be a target of a drone strike.
Before a drone strike can be approved, it must be certain that no innocent people will be killed or injured, said a top White House official.
One of the victims was the 16-year-old son of a suspected terrorist.
However, the president still wants to be able to order secret, deadly attacks anywhere the White House finds a threat from al-Qaida.
President Barack Obama announced Thursday he would limit the use of drones in targeting terrorists.
It held a series of hearings on targeted killing.
Many of the drone strikes that the CIA and the military have launched have been in Yemen.
Aircraft that fly without pilots and shoot missiles have been used to kill enemies of the United States in its war on terror.
But on Thursday, Obama announced he would limit the use of the strikes.
Missiles can be fired with the touch of a button from another country.
Now, a drone strike will only be allowed against fighters who are planning a terror attack.
Congress has had doubts about the drone program.
It held a series of meetings about the targeted  killings.
The top al-Qaida leaders in Pakistan are all nearly defeated, an aide said.
The war in nearby Afghanistan is winding down.
The United States will not have as much  reason to fire missiles at groups of suspected fighters.
The U.S. and its partners are set to leave Afghanistan in 2014.
Many of the U.S. drone strikes have taken place in Yemen.
Tesla Motors Inc. already claims to have the electric car that can go the longest between charges, and now it is claiming another automotive superlative \u2014 the safest car on the road.
The company said that not having a big gasoline engine in the front of the car creates a safer design.
Tesla tucks its large, heavy battery pack below the floor of the car, a factor that adds stability and also improves handling, it said.

Tesla collects special credits from California as well as other environmental credits every time it sells a Model S. The credits have helped its finances.
The "the crumple zone" is designed to be smashed and absorb some of the energy in a crash.
Back on the road, Tesla started selling the Model S about a year ago.
It has sold about $150 million of such credits to other automakers so far this year.
But car makers receive an overall Vehicle Safety Score that can show a rating above five, the automaker said.

The dirty rocks of salt are packed into a storage shed on a snowy lot, where a nearby bulldozer, its engine on, stands at the ready.
The shortage is also affecting consumers who use salt to make their walkways and stairs less slippery \u2014 hardware stores in Missouri and Kansas, including chains such as Big Lots and Sears, said they were out of salt, and were waiting for more to come in.
Wichita, for instance, placed an order for 1,000 tons of salt in December, but received only 800.
Andrew Cuomo, after declaring a state of emergency, directed the state Department of Transportation to move 130 truckloads of surplus salt to communities that need it.
The dirty rocks of salt are packed into a storage shed on a snowy lot, where a nearby bulldozer, its engine on, stands at the ready.
Some cities, such as Wichita, Kan., are so low on salt that they are choosing to salt only main roads, using sand for the rest.
"I think pretty much every salt mine in the country is out now, or very nearly," said Harold Mayo, general manager of the Hutchinson Salt Mine in Kansas, where much of the Midwest\'s salt is mined.
Wichita, for instance, placed an order for 1,000 tons of salt in December, but received only 800.

Hardware stores in Missouri and Kansas, including chains such as Big Lots and Sears, said they were out of salt, and were waiting for more to come in.
Andrew Cuomo directed the state Department of Transportation to move 130 truckloads of surplus salt to communities that need it.

"Some of their offspring wound up in the Canary Islands via the international pet trade, and then got loose.
"Now, their densities are going through the roof."
Fisher is among three U.S. experts heading to the Canary Islands in May to advise scientists and government officials on the behavior and potential vulnerabilities of the snakes that first raised alarms in 2007.
Since then, their populations have swelled to thousands per square mile in the eastern and northwestern portions of the 602-square-mile volcanic island of Gran Canaria \u2014 a kingsnake haven because of its mild temperatures, moist ocean air and lush terrain teeming with prey that never learned to fear snakes.
Brown tree snakes have established themselves as a breeding species in the Pacific island of Guam.
"The data obtained show that the California kingsnake has a high ability to adapt and its spread to all of the islands is more than likely," said a 2012 study funded by the European Union and published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
An albino variety of California kingsnake popular in the pet trade has infested the Canary Islands, decimating native bird, mammal and lizard species that have had no time to evolve evasive patterns in what was once a stable ecology northwest of Africa.
"The trouble is, these snakes spend much of their lives beneath the ground," said Robert Reed, an invasive species specialist with the USGS.
"This snake will quite possibly impact the local reptilian population to the point where we see their total disappearance."

Around 1,000 young people across several high schools in suburban Denver participated Wednesday in the largest of a series of student demonstrations opposing a new set of high school history standards proposed by a conservative-led school board.
Supporters say the new outline from the College Board, which oversees the program, would focus on critical thinking and classroom discussion rather than memorization.
At the large afternoon protest, students mainly from Chatfield and Dakota Ridge high schools peacefully gathered along the roads near Littleton as deputies and school officials looked on.
The next school board meeting is scheduled for Oct. 2.
The dozens of students who left Alameda International High School in Lakewood asked McMinimee about the school board plan and teacher concerns including pay, KMGH-TV reported.

Gay couples in Ireland woke up Sunday morning with dreams of wedding plans dancing in their heads.
This new reality was sinking in after the Irish people voted with a surprisingly strong 62 percent "yes" to change the country\'s constitution to allow gay couples to marry.
Because the existing marriage law requires a minimum three-month notice for any civil marriages, the first gay weddings cannot happen until the autumn.
Zappone, a Seattle native who settled with her Irish spouse in Dublin three decades ago, said that for so long, she has had to dig in her heels and say, "Well, we ARE married.
Zappone and Gilligan thrilled a crowd of thousands of people waving rainbow flags and celebrating Saturday as the vote results came in at Dublin Castle.
"I said yes to Katherine 12 years ago at our marriage in Canada," Gilligan shouted to the crowd.
They also spoke of the remaining wait to become officially married in Ireland, hopefully before Christmas.
First, parliament must pass the same-sex marriage bill.
Gay couples in Ireland woke up Sunday morning with dreams of wedding plans dancing in their heads.
For Senator Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan, their day has nearly come.
Then Irish President Michael D. Higgins will sign the bill into law and amend the constitution.

A civil wedding ceremony means that a couple is married by an official, instead of by a priest or a minister.
Since 2003 the lesbian couple have fought to get the Irish government to recognize their Canadian marriage.
On Saturday, Zappone and Gilligan thrilled a crowd of thousands of people waving rainbow-colored flags as the vote results came in at Dublin Castle.
Gilligan said there are not many moments in life where a person is surrounded by so much joy.

WASHINGTON\u2014President Barack Obama rolled out a new plan Thursday to make two years of community college free, or nearly so, for millions of students across the country, a major investment that the White House cast as changing the face of higher education.
At its heart is dedicated federal funding to cover 75 percent of tuition, with the states picking up the rest of the tab.
"Anything involving more money to pay for things is going to be difficult in this Congress," said Ben Miller, a senior education policy analyst at the New America Foundation.
"Increasing investments in higher education are just hard to find."
He has tried to tie financial aid to college performance and urged states to take performance into consideration when distributing funds to their public colleges.
"We see right now that so many students and families really don\'t have a great sense of how much college is going to cost.

President Barack Obama rolled out a new plan to make two years of community college free, or nearly so, for millions of students across the country.
It was posted Thursday on Facebook, ahead of a visit Friday to a community college and technical center in Knoxville, Tennessee.
White House advisers declined to say how much the proposal would cost or how the government planned to pay for it.
Experts said it could cost the federal government tens of billions of dollars.
The plan would save a full-time community college student an average of $3,800 in tuition per year.

University of Pennsylvania archaeologists say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago, the first discovery of what they predict could be more than a dozen tombs from a forgotten dynasty.
The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday in conjunction with the Egyptian government.
The researchers already have begun excavating several nearby sites that appear to be from the same dynasty, at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology.
The tomb, dated to 1650 B.C., appears to have been raided by tomb robbers in ancient times, Wegner said.
The tombs of other apparent members of the dynasty are thought to lie nearby.

The FDA noted that trans fats in processed food have been shown to raise "bad" cholesterol, raising the risk of coronary heart disease.
Under the new rules, the FDA has declared that partially hydrogenated oils, the main source of trans fats, are a food additive not "generally recognized as safe."
The new guidelines will require companies wishing to use the ingredient to first seek approval from the FDA.
It also would prevent companies from claiming their food contains "zero grams trans fat" if the product has a half-gram or less per serving, the latitude currently allowed on nutrition labels.
The FDA has opened a 60-day review period to take input from the food industry and other experts.
California became the first state to require restaurants to stop cooking with trans fats in 2008.
"If the serving size is small and you eat several servings, the amount of trans fats adds up," said Jennifer Ventrelle, lifestyle director of the Rush University Prevention Center and a registered dietitian at Rush University Medical Center.
But additional information included on the label notes that preparing the dish by adding margarine and 2 percent reduced fat milk adds 4 grams of trans fat per serving.
Mondelez International, which makes snacks under dozens of brand names including Oreo cookies, Wheat Thins, Triscuits, Fig Newtons and Nilla Wafers, said all of its cookies and crackers are labeled as "zero grams trans fat" per serving.
General Mills, owner of brands Betty Crocker and Pillsbury, said that it has taken the trans fat out of more than 90 percent of its U.S. retail products.
The FDA proposal focuses on partially hydrogenated oils and would not affect the small amount of naturally occurring trans fat found in some meat and dairy products.
Trans fatty acids, or trans fats, are formed when manufacturers turn liquid oils into solid fats by adding hydrogen atoms, a process called hydrogenation.
But some Mondelez products, like Ritz crackers, still contain partially hydrogenated oil, according to the label.
Most major restaurant chains eliminated partially hydrogenated oils for use in cooking in the mid- to late-2000s, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
But a number of chains still have menu items that contain some partially hydrogenated oil in baked goods.

When geophysicist H. Jay Melosh attended a meeting of U.S. and ex-Soviet nuclear weapons designers in May 1995, he was surprised by how eager the Cold Warriors were to work together against an unlikely but dangerous extraterrestrial threat: asteroids on a collision course with Earth.
After Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb, urged others meeting at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to consider building and orbiting huge, new nuclear weapons for planetary protection, some top Russian weapons experts lent their support.
"It was a really bizarre thing to see that these weapons designers were willing to work together \u2014 to build the biggest bombs ever," said Melosh, an expert in space impacts who has an asteroid named after him.
Bong Wie, the director of Iowa State University\'s Asteroid Deflection Research Center, said he has a three-year, $600,000 grant from NASA to design a "hypervelocity nuclear interceptor system," basically an ICBM-borne warhead fitted with a battering ram.
Keith Holsapple, an engineering professor at the University of Washington, said NASA has given him a five-year, $1.25 million research grant to study how either an impact device or a nuclear explosion could deflect an Earth-bound asteroid from its path.
The leading supporter of the nuclear solution in the United States is probably David S.P.
"You fragment it with enough force so that the pieces spread out," and most miss the Earth, he said.
But shattering a large asteroid close to hitting Earth probably would require a weapon with a yield of about a megaton, or 1 million tons of TNT, he said, which is roughly the power of the largest in the current U.S. arsenal.
Mark Boslough, a physicist at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, another weapons lab, has worked part time in the past on modeling the effects of nuclear blasts on asteroids.
He says that 90 percent of the biggest asteroids already have been found and ruled out as a near-term threat, demonstrating there is time for finding suitable, non-nuclear alternatives \u2014 such as hitting asteroids with rams, zapping them with lasers, tugging them off a kamikaze trajectory, or deflecting them with solar sails.
A Sept. 16 Department of Energy announcement cited "defense from asteroids" as one potential area of study.

Weapons experts in the United States and Russia also are citing the asteroid threat as a reason to hold onto \u2014 or to build \u2014 very large-yield nuclear explosives.
If the collision was still at least a decade away, a nuclear blast could knock the asteroid off course.
But shattering a large asteroid close to hitting Earth probably would require a weapon with a yield of about a megaton, or 1 million tons of TNT.
Ninety percent of the biggest asteroids already have been found and ruled out as a near-term threat, he claims.
For nuclear bombs to work even as a last-ditch effort, he said, they would need to be more powerful than any that currently exist.
In May 1995, geophysicist H. Jay Melosh attended a meeting of U.S. and ex-Soviet nuclear weapons designers.
If the collision was still at least a decade away, a nuclear blast could knock the asteroid off course.
It sounds, they say, like something out of the 1998 Bruce Willis action film "Armageddon."
But the idea has strong supporters.
And Melosh has tested one of his ideas.
In 2005 he served as co-investigator on a NASA mission known as Deep Impact.
And a lot more people, he warned, have been killed by nuclear weapons than by asteroids.
Will the next egg you crack come from a chicken raised in a roomier barn?
Since California passed a measure requiring more space for egg-laying hens in 2008, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Michigan and Ohio have enacted laws regulating hen housing, while activists in Massachusetts have launched a similar measure aimed at the 2016 presidential ballot.
A 2010 law effectively expanded Proposition 2 to apply to all shell eggs sold in the state, which consumes roughly twice as many eggs as it produces.
The shift has driven up costs and widened the difference between wholesale prices in California and other markets, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture economists.
The gap between California and New York, for example, rose to $1 in January, from a 12-cent differential in October 2014, according to the USDA.
Klippen said the industry will fight efforts to extend cage-free regulations.
"The McDonald\'s announcement really settles the debate as to whether there will be a future for cage confinement in the egg industry \u2014 the answer is no, there won\'t be," said Paul Shapiro, vice president of farm animal protection for the Humane Society of the U.S. "How quickly that will happen is now the real question."
Hickman, like other West Coast producers already in the California market, has been moving toward roomier enclosures since Proposition 2 passed in November 2008.
The state Department of Food and Agriculture has since issued a rule requiring about 116 square inches per bird.
Large-scale egg producers in the Midwest also have shifted production.
This week, the average wholesale price for a dozen white, large eggs hovered around $2.40 in California, up by $1.26 from this time last year, according to the USDA.
The nationwide average was $1.78, up about 82 cents from the same period last year, according to the department.
Klippen said McDonald\'s bowed to "a small group of consumers, who are sort of the animal activists."

The California Department of Food and Agriculture has since issued a rule requiring about 116 square inches per bird.
Before the law passed, Hickman housed several million chickens in the stacked wire enclosures known as battery cages.

The island is Prince of Wales Island, an outpost 55 miles northwest of Ketchikan that, at nearly 2,600 square miles, is home to just 6,000 people and accessible from the mainland only by boat or plane.
Yet the wolf population has been in steady decline, and cutting down more trees is expected to pressure them further.
While that decision is pending, logging continues, as does hunting \u2014 of both wolves and the deer that are their food supply.
Climate change has made the battles more complicated, raising tender questions about which species should be priorities and whether they can even be saved.
The timber industry in southeast Alaska is a fading fraction of what it was before federal regulations began limiting old-growth logging in the 1990s.
Mills on Prince of Wales were built to process larger, older trees.
The mill on Prince of Wales, run by Viking Lumber, is viewed as important because it provides year-round work, while logging jobs are seasonal.
"There\'s got to be a way to transition this small number of people and communities in a way that makes sense, instead of just totally trashing this species and this ecosystem," said Larry Edwards, who works on Alaska issues for Greenpeace and is based in nearby Sitka.
The story of the wolves, the island and the ancient forest began long before there were struggling sawmills and endangered species.
This spring, with the approval of the U.S. Forest Service, loggers began cutting thousands of acres of old-growth trees on Prince of Wales Island in one of the largest and most controversial timber sales in the Tongass in two decades.
Just two decades ago, Prince of Wales was home to about 300 wolves.

The industry supports fewer than 300 jobs in the region, compared with the 3,500 workers it employed two decades ago.
While the industry has plummeted, others, including tourism and fishing, have grown.
The younger, second-growth trees the Forest Service more readily allows to be logged are shipped to Asia and milled there more cheaply.
The story of the wolves, the island and the ancient forest began long before there were struggling sawmills and endangered species.
Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to make a final decision on whether the wolf should be listed as an endangered species.

And cutting down more trees is expected to make them die off even faster.
At the heart of the debate in southeast Alaska is the so-called Tongass transition plan.
The younger, second-growth trees are shipped to Asia and milled there more cheaply.
However, timber industry leaders say there may be enough timber to last only three or four years.
He said there must be a way to change over to cutting down new growth trees "in a way that makes sense" instead of destroying the wolves and the environment.

Most coral reefs in temperate climates can withstand temperatures only as high as 29 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit) before they bleach\u2014a process in which corals expel their symbiotic algae living in their tissue, causing them to turn white and increasing their vulnerability to disease and death.
Yet most scientists say climate change poses the biggest threat in the future.
Just this month the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned there could be a global bleaching event in 2015 due to warming waters\u2014the third in the past two decades.
I think we are now getting to this idea that actually, in some cases, these mechanism can arise very quickly, within a few years."
If symbionts exist elsewhere, then corals faced with bleaching could in theory switch them on as temperatures rise.
"That 2 degrees is certainly good news, in a sense that it will compensate or could compensate for the some of the warming we are expecting to see this century," Baker says.
Such doubts have done little to dampen the enthusiasm for using the Persian Gulf reefs or the genes found there in future conservation strategies.
And the reintroduced corals might not even cope with new environmental conditions.
Yet most scientists say climate change poses the biggest threat in the future.
"It\'s not all doom and gloom for corals," says Andrew Baker, a marine biologist at the University of Miami.
"People still have those concerns, but they can see that it\'s important to develop the tools and to assess what is actually possible."
Still, most scientists say climate change poses the biggest threat in the future.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned that warming waters could lead to a global bleaching event in 2015 \u2014 the third one in the past two decades.

Baker has considered introducing heat-tolerant symbionts in nurseries and then reseeding areas at risk.

Yet, scientists have found that corals in the Persian Gulf reefs can handle water temperatures as high as 36 degrees C (97 degrees F).
Still, most scientists say climate change is the biggest threat in the future.
Unfortunately, these genetic changes are not happening as quickly as the Earth is warming.
They discovered a new type of algae that could handle warmer water.
Researchers are not sure whether it was evolution or if the algae was brought in by currents from outside the region and survived "a selection process."
Some experts think researchers would be better off looking for answers in more temperate regions.
They have suggested the Mozambique Channel between Tanzania and Madagascar.
They still want to keep looking for ways to use the Persian Gulf algae to help corals in other regions.
There has also been more emphasis on aseptic packaging, which allows milk to be kept unrefrigerated on a store shelf, much like a juice box.
We can\'t just put a gallon of milk on a shelf and hope someone buys it," Massey said.
Among those partners is Dairy Farmers of America, a cooperative that represents thousands of farmers nationwide.
According to her, it is essential for the dairy industry to develop new products, such as flavored milk and dairy-based sports drinks.
The change could lead to millions more gallons of milk being sold.
Americans these days are drinking much less milk then they used to.
Nonetheless, businesses can save money if milk can be moved on non-refrigerated trucks or stored without having to be kept cold.

More than one in three American kids will eat fast food today, a new government report says.
Children from families who were close to the poverty line counted on fast food for 11.5 percent of their daily calories, on average.
That compared with 11.2 percent of Latinos, 13.1 percent of whites and 13.9 percent of African-Americans.
The other significant difference had to do with age.
Overall, children between the ages of 2 and 11 were much less likely than adolescents between the ages of 12 and 19 to dine on fast food.
That pattern was seen regardless of gender, race or ethnicity, weight status or family income, the researchers found.

At its height, "World of Warcraft" boasted 12 million paying subscribers.
Spy agencies have long worried that such games serve as a good cover for terrorists or other evildoers.
In one of the documents cited Monday, the NSA warned that the games could give intelligence targets a place to "hide in plain sight."
In a statement, Blizzard Entertainment said that it is "unaware of any surveillance taking place.
Still, the reports point to a determined effort to go undercover into a world many people associate with adolescents and shut-ins.
It tried to tie specific accounts and characters to Islamic extremism and weapons dealers, the Guardian reported.
Intelligence on the fantasy world could eventually translate to real-world espionage success, one of the documents suggested.
"World of Warcraft" subscribers included "telecom engineers, embassy drivers, scientists, the military and other intelligence agencies," it said.

For years, chocolate lovers have remained blissfully unaware of the precise reason bittersweet dark chocolate seems to improve cardiovascular health.
What they found was that after cocoa was "digested," long molecules called polyphenolic polymers remained within the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract.
"These materials are anti-inflammatory and they serve to prevent or delay the onset of some forms of cardiovascular disease that are associated with inflammation," Finley said.
One of the issues involving dark chocolate, Finley said, was the amount of sugar and fat that chocolate candy contained.

Now it is his greatest ambition to start a farm, but not in China, a country where the very word for "farmer," nongmin, is synonymous with "peasant."
"Throughout Chinese history, our land was never enough," said Tian Zhihong, a professor of international agriculture at China Agricultural University.
"We want to bring American sunshine, land and water back to China," said Zhang Renwu, a businessman who owns two farms in Utah growing alfalfa to feed dairy cows.
Smaller Chinese [enterpreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) have leased farms across the border in Russia as part of a deal with Moscow.
"China \'land grab\' sees it given control of 5 percent of Ukraine, accused of \'neo-colonialism,\' " read a headline several months ago in Britain\'s Daily Telegraph.
"Zimbabwe now a full-fledged Chinese colony," read a headline in the Zimbabwe Mail in November about Chinese-owned wheat, soybean and tobacco fields on the outskirts of Harare, the capital.
"It is only the last two years that the big agricultural companies are going overseas in a big way, and I think you will see much more," said Ma, the CnAgri analyst.

When Ma Wenfeng was a boy, the last thing he would have dreamed of was becoming a farmer.
Now it is his greatest ambition to start a farm \u2014 but not in China, a country where the word "farmer" is synonymous with "peasant."
It also has been blamed for dragging its feet when it comes to making long-overdue changes that would help modernize domestic agriculture.
The Chinese company in question, Xinjiang Production &amp; Construction, quickly issued a denial.
The Chinese government has been criticized at home for allowing too much farmland to be paved over for apartments and shopping malls.
"It is only the last two years that the big agricultural companies are going overseas in a big way," said Ma, the agricultural analyst.
Together these accounted for almost 12 million acres.
A farm that size would account for an area almost as large as Belgium or Maryland.
Now it is his greatest ambition to start a farm \u2014 but not in China.
The Chinese government has been criticized for allowing too much farmland to be paved over for apartments and shopping malls.
These plantations are growing corn, rice, cassava and sesame.
China is far from the world leader when it comes to overseas farmland, however: The United States still ranks first.
The family was so poor it mainly ate mantou, a kind of plain steamed bread.
Worldwide in 2012, there were at least 54 Chinese agricultural projects outside the country.
Some have accused the Chinese of taking advantage of the much-colonized continent.
In 2012, it controlled almost twice as much overseas farmland as it did two years earlier.
In his country, the word "farmer" is pretty much the same as "peasant."
They are hoping to find big stretches of good farmland where food can be grown for Chinese use.
This has led to a huge demand for imported food, said Ma.
Last year, Chinese company Shuanghui International bought Smithfield Foods and a vast amount of U.S. farmland: more than 100,000 acres in Missouri, Texas and North Carolina.
Large state-owned companies are setting up plantations in Africa.
There, foreigners are not allowed to buy land outright.
City officials in Napa had long worried that the grand building on the corner of Second and Brown streets \u2014 with its brick walls and giant red-tiled cupolas \u2014 could be devastated by a major earthquake.
The work was completed years ago on the 104-year-old property.
Many cities have laws requiring owners to seismically retrofit them.
Mortar can deteriorate over time and grow so weak that the bricks can begin to slide.
There are more costly retrofit options that can better fortify brick buildings, such as adding reinforced concrete or polymers to the brick walls or installing diagonal braces.
But most cities require less-stringent, less-costly rules.
Based off of photos of the building, David Cocke, president of Structural Focus, an earthquake retrofit firm based in Gardena, said it appeared the mortar between the bricks had been in poor condition.
"Everything has got to work right, and if the shaking is strong enough, it could still result in a dangerous situation.
And no owner is going to spend the money to come in and make that particular building as strong as a hospital.
Co-owner Kim Erasmy said the building was retrofitted before she bought it in 2002, but now city officials told her the building may be too unstable for her to go in.
City officials in Napa had long worried that the grand building on the corner of Second and Brown streets \u2014 with its brick walls and giant red-tiled cupolas \u2014 could be devastated by a major earthquake.
"We can\'t keep every single brick in place in many of these older buildings without extraordinarily costly retrofits," said Fred Turner, structural engineer with the California Seismic Safety Commission.
The work has prevented countless deaths by keeping these buildings from pancaking to the ground.
And no owner is going to spend the money to come in and make that particular building as strong as a hospital.
Silver said he now has enough money to pay for strengthening his buildings.

American Indians across the Western U.S. are challenging moves by federal wildlife officials to lift protections for grizzly bears that roam a vast wilderness centered on Yellowstone National Park, citing worries over potential trophy hunting of a species many tribes consider sacred.
A former chairman of Arizona\'s Hopi Tribe, Ben Nuvamsa, says his people regard the grizzly as an "uncle" who possesses strong healing powers and plays a central role in traditional ceremonies.
Such occurrences have fueled opposition to continued protections within the ranching industry and among state officials.
... We want the grizzly bear protected with those lands, and the grizzly bear returned to areas where we can co-manage them."

American Indians across the Western U.S. are fighting to protect the grizzly bears that are so meaningful to their culture.
The tribes are concerned hunters will endanger the bears, which they believe are sacred.
U.S. wildlife officials, and wildlife officials for the states of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, claim the 700 to 1,000 bears in the region are not endangered.
Since the 2009 court ruling, government biologists have sought to further prove their conclusions with new research.
These events have fueled opposition to continued protections within the ranching industry and among state officials.
Grizzly bears lived across much of the West until hunting and trapping eliminated them from more than 98 percent of their historic range in the continental United States.
"These are our treaty lands, our ancestral homelands," said Lee Juan Tyler, vice chairman of the Shoshone Bannock Tribes.
Federal officials said they have consulted with five tribes in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.

Veronica Zaragoza, who grew up picking berries and tomatoes, watched as the Mexican farming industry was transformed.
Zaragoza, a mother of three, was among those detained in a field surrounded by police for 17 hours before being released.
Their defenders say that the wages they offer are higher than in other Mexican agricultural regions.
"Our primary focus continues to be toward the well-being of our employees," the statement said.
But produce picker Bernardo Velasco, 47, said his family lives in bleak conditions.
Zaragoza said she saw protesters thrown to the ground and pummeled by police.
Contracts already exist between the growers and the unions that represent the workers and negotiate for them with the farming companies.
He hoped to reach an agreement that would let them bypass union bosses and let the pickers deal directly with their employers.

Veronica Zaragoza has seen everything in this fertile agricultural region change, except her wages.
Her pay is just a little more than when she started picking as a 13-year-old.
Pickers left the fields and stood shoulder to shoulder blocking the main highway.
Hundreds of police and army soldiers cleared away the crowds with rubber bullets and tear gas, a chemical that is used to stop protests.
Farmworkers are seeking higher salaries and health care.
On Thursday afternoon, dozens of police officers kept watch on hundreds of people gathered outside a state government building.
Alberto Munoz, a lawyer representing the growers, said it would be difficult to change working conditions for the farmworkers.
The union leaders are also often seen as more on the side of business owners than on the side of the farmworkers.

It\'s just consumer information, the same kind of information that\'s on a label of a new car that says where an engine\'s from."
Last month, the Canadian government called the new rules a "protectionist policy" that discriminated against foreign competition.
Ottawa said it might respond by imposing tariffs on a long list of products, including pork, fruits and vegetables, pasta, chocolate, cheese, office furniture and many more.
And for consumer groups, labeling has become the issue that never goes away, even though it wins strong backing in polls.
"I thought we were done with it, and all of a sudden it\'s still going on," said Chris Waldrop, director of the Food Policy Institute at the Consumer Federation of America.
"This is just another effort to do that, but the public is not on their side on this.
Under the new rules, the labels will provide more information, detailing what countries the animals were born in and where they were raised and slaughtered.
But Joseph, whose Made in the USA Foundation urged the USDA to pass the new rules, said labeling is both a health and safety issue for American consumers, who put more faith in U.S. products.
"We don\'t want beef to become a luxury item," said McCan, a fifth-generation rancher from Victoria, Texas.
Backers of the new rules, who say labeling can be done at a minimal cost, are braced for another battle with cattle producers.
"They\'re totally wrong \u2014 consumers have the right to know where products are from," said Joel Joseph, chairman of the Los Angeles-based Made in the USA Foundation, a group that promotes labeling and products manufactured in the United States.
The new labeling rules also could ignite a trade war with Canada, which is threatening to retaliate.

The rules would require that the country where the cattle came from be included on beef packages.
Canadian officials immediately complained to the World Trade Organization.
They accused the government of dragging its feet on adopting new rules.
His ranch is just three hours from the Mexican border.
If the beef has to be labeled, he has to separate the animals when he sells them.
The regulations require that the country where the cattle came from be included on beef packages.
If McCan does not want to have to separate his cattle, "then he shouldn\'t get cattle from Mexico," he said.
The new labeling rules also could ignite a fight with Canada.
Cattle from Mexico get heavily tested and treated.
But Joseph said labeling is both a health and safety concern for American consumers.
U.S. food is safer and cleaner, he said.

These primitive organisms, called chemolithoautotrophs, feed on chemicals found in rocks and make their own energy.
"Ancient Mars was more habitable than we imagined," said California Institute of Technology geologist John Grotzinger, lead scientist for the Curiosity mission.
This wet, potentially Earth-like environment could have lasted for tens of millions of years, giving life a wide-open window to emerge.
"They\'re really quite amazing," said Malcolm Walters, an astrobiologist at University of New South Wales in Australia who helped find some of the earliest microfossils on Earth.
But rather than head straight to Mount Sharp, the rover took a months-long detour to an intriguing spot called Yellowknife Bay.
There, Curiosity drilled into two mudstone rocks, named John Klein and Cumberland.
Life could certainly evolve and thrive without organic carbon.
That said, scientists do want to find organic carbon because it would indicate that the planet once had a wider range of life-friendly habitats.
So Farley directed Curiosity to analyze several soil samples and found telltale gases \u2014 such as helium-3, neon-21 and argon-36 \u2014 that helped pin down the age of the Martian surface.
If any organic carbon exists in Gale Crater, the foot of one of these scarps would be the best place to search for it, the scientists concluded.
"You just never know what you\'ll encounter," said NASA scientist Douglas Ming, who led the organic-carbon study.
These primitive organisms, called chemolithoautotrophs, feed on chemicals found in rocks and make their own energy.
It was a risk to turn away from the planned mission, and it paid off, Grotzinger said.
That meant the amount of cosmic radiation exposure was also lower than they expected.

When Dariel Alvarez escaped from his native country, Cuba, it was hard not to fear the worst.
He left realizing he might never see his family again.
Alvarez escaped from Cuba without saying goodbye to several friends.
Alvarez went more than year without playing baseball while he waited for his unblocking license.
Showalter still has high hopes for Alvarez and thinks he could play in the major leagues.
Honestly, I would have taken whatever they would have offered me, because I wanted to play baseball."
Canedo, who Alvarez said immigrated from Cuba legally, is working toward becoming an American citizen.
It is against the law for Cubans to leave their country without permission.
He left realizing he might never see his family again.
In late June, the outfielder received an invitation to the All-Star Futures Game in Minneapolis.
His journey from a beach in Cuba to a spot on the Norfolk Tides, a minor league baseball team, was not easy.
They all have stories of escaping Cuba to play baseball in the major leagues.
Alvarez has spoken to many of the Cuban players on different Major League teams.
Defensively, he covers a lot of ground in the outfield.

Every year, about 1,000 babies are born in the United States with half a heart \u2014 a rare defect that requires a series of risky surgeries and, even then, leaves the infants with a strong likelihood that their hearts will wear out prematurely.
If it works, the new technique could buy these children time as scientists scramble for a cure for the congenital defect called hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).
The Mayo study, which will begin as soon as 10 eligible candidates can be enrolled, could also pave the way for additional breakthroughs in stem cell treatments that would help the 19,000 children born each year with other heart defects.
Ava Grace Weitl was born by cesarean section on May 8, 2012, then whisked away for her first surgery.
Nelson said he thinks stem cells taken from umbilical cord blood and placed into a growing heart will prove even more effective.
He said it tore him up to know that babies who endured three open heart surgeries would often return as young children with irreparable heart damage and little likelihood of finding a donor heart in time to save them.
Every year, about 1,000 babies are born in the United States with half a heart \u2014 a rare defect that requires a series of risky surgeries and, even then, leaves the infants with a strong likelihood that their hearts will wear out prematurely.
"We\'re really here to make a difference in children\'s lives who are living today with unmet needs."
DeShaw and her husband, Brad Weitl, sought help from the Mayo Clinic for the baby they named Ava Grace.
They learned that children born with defects on the left side of the heart must undergo a series of three complex surgeries.
"We wanted to participate, not only because we thought that at some point Ava might benefit, but we also wanted to help all the other babies \u2026 and to try to give them the best shot," DeShaw said.
Every year, about 1,000 babies are born in the United States with half a heart.
Stem cells can grow into different types of organs.
Within a few days of birth, surgeons reconstruct the heart so that the right ventricle can do both its own work and the work of the defective left ventricle.
About nine of 10 at the Mayo live.
Nelson said he thinks stem cells taken from umbilical cord blood and placed into a growing heart will work even better.
Also, Nelson said, stem cells from the umbilical cord seem to know when to stop producing heart cells.
He said it tore him up to know that babies who endured three surgeries would often return as young children with heart damage that could not be fixed and little chance  of finding a donor heart in time to save them.
But there are also children living into their early 20s.
Nelson dedicated himself to finding a cure for HLHS when he was studying to become a heart surgeon for children.
But right now, the doctors at Mayo focusing on babies who need the most help now.
She even was flown back to Mayo in a helicopter once.
Ava Grace Weitl was born on May 8, 2012.
The baby stayed at the hospital until September.
But Ava has had many problems since she went home.
The stem cells are put into the heart during that second operation.
The damage could not be fixed, and the children usually could not find a new heart in time to save them.
Of all the issues the Obama administration is grappling with, a modest redesign of what food labels say about sweeteners might not have seemed among the more controversial.
The proposal being considered by the Food and Drug Administration would add a new line to labels on packaged products noting how many teaspoons of sugar had been added.
The FDA has received 287,889 public comments on the plan, including many from major food companies and trade associations.
Sugar is sugar, and no evidence justifies singling out one type for added labeling requirements, industry officials say.
"Consumers already have the information they need to make healthy dietary choices," the Dairy Institute of California wrote in lengthy objections to the administration\'s plan.
"Such information could confuse consumers by taking their focus off of calories," the company\'s director of regulatory affairs wrote to the agency.
Another of the dozens of companies calling on the FDA to scrap the sugar plan is the Roman Meal Company, which makes whole-grain breads.
That included even most deli meats on supermarket shelves.
But for advocacy groups, the effort is part of a crusade to get companies to lower the sugar content of products.

A minor plan to change what food labels say about sugar has stirred up a big food fight.
It also shows how worried food makers are that consumers will find out.
Current labels give the total amount of sugar in a product.
He said it sets an alarming example.

Right now, food labels give the total amount of sugar in a product.
The number includes the sugars naturally present in a food and the amount that is added.
He wrote that science does not show a good reason for the added-sugar labeling.
The information could confuse people, it wrote to the FDA.
Too many calories make people gain weight, but so does too much sugar.
It found that nearly 3 out of 5 had extra sugar added.

"We\'ve been working toward the goal of vehicles that can shoulder the entire burden of driving," the company wrote on its blog.
Instead, the company wants to develop self-driving software that will "improve road safety and help people who can\'t drive."
California law is expected to allow the operation of such vehicles on public roads by the end of this year.
"We\'re going to learn a lot from this experience, and if the technology develops as we hope, we\'ll work with partners to bring this technology into the world safely," Google said on its blog.
Users could subscribe for a monthly fee, and take the cars when they needed them for short trips around town.
That change may happen faster than people think.
Many automakers predict they will have fully self-driving cars on the road by 2020.
And that number could swell to 11.8 million 10 years later, according to a study by Juliussen and IHS Automotive.

The measure also would offer defendants an "absolute defense" in court if a gun is used in the face of a violent attack.
Don Plummer, a spokesman for the Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta, said that allowing guns in churches is "dangerous, and it\'s bad theology."

The legislation would allow licensed gun owners to take weapons into churches, synagogues and mosques, if its leaders allow it.
The legislation comes as a Gallup poll in January found increased support for easing gun restrictions.
The poll found that 16 percent supported making making guns more available, up from 5 percent a year earlier.

The latest, in the southern China county of Boluo, in Guangdong province, saw thousands of people march through the streets Saturday, with some returning Sunday, to protest a planned garbage incinerator.
In April, hundreds of residents in Maoming, another city in Guangdong province, clashed with police over a planned paraxylene plant.
In May, a protest of a planned waste incinerator in Hangzhou, south of Shanghai, also turned into a melee.
Nie Yongfeng, a professor emeritus at the Tsinghua University School of Environment in Beijing, said new incinerators in China operate at or above European Union standards for limiting dioxins and other pollutants.
Others, however, say the government has been less than transparent in monitoring emissions from big waste burners.
"There has been little release of public data, so it is hard to know if the incinerators are being operated safely," said Lin Youzhu, manager of the solid waste program for Friends of Nature, China\'s oldest environmental group.
By the end of 2013, according to Lin, 176 waste incinerators were operating in China, with another 74 under construction.
The government, she said, "pays little attention to reducing waste at the source and puts all its attention into disposal."
Shapiro, the American University professor and author of the 2012 book "China\'s Environmental Challenges," said it is encouraging to see Chinese people standing together against further degradation of their air, water and soil.

Tehran Police Chief Hossein Sajedinia confirmed the arrests on state TV late Tuesday in a report that blurred images from the video and then showed the six with their backs turned toward the camera.
Iranian media in the past quoted Rouhani as saying the account is authentic.
While Rouhani pursues a policy of social and cultural openness, hard-liners say the government should be tough to those who challenge interpretations of Islamic norms.
But in Iran, some see the trend as promoting the spread of Western culture, as laws in the Islamic Republic ban women from dancing in public or appearing outside without covering their hair with the hijab.
Tehran Police Chief Hossein Sajedinia confirmed the arrests on state TV late Tuesday in a report that blurred images from the video and then showed the six with their backs turned toward the camera.
An Internet video of six young Iranian men and women dancing to Pharrell Williams\' "Happy" has led to their arrests, showing how far Tehran will go to halt what it deems to be decadent Western behavior \u2014 despite the views of its moderate president.
"We should see the cyber world as an opportunity," said Rouhani, according to the official IRNA news agency.
Fans have posted similar videos from around the world, showing people dancing down streets and smiling in choreographed crowds.
The government also bans some websites.
Yet, it stopped short of mentioning the video or the arrests directly.
Sites such as YouTube and Facebook are blocked by government censors.
However, many young and Web-savvy Iranians bypass the controls.
Last week, hard-liners marched against women dressing provocatively and not wearing the hijab, a veil that covers the hair.

As his 10-year-old son, Wesley, bombed down a snow-packed hill Monday afternoon, Russell Pope smiled.
After a mostly snowless winter, the Overland Park, Kansas, man enjoyed finally getting to sled with his children on the Presidents Day holiday.
Omaha prohibited sledding at a popular hill as a test after settling its lawsuit but allowed it again after residents ignored the ban.
In most states \u2014 including Missouri and Kansas \u2014 "recreational use" statutes shield cities from liability for injuries resulting from sledding.
The question is whether a municipality could foresee a risk, he said.

As city attorney Tom Mumgaard put it: "It wasn\'t practical."
Instead, the city posted warning signs, stationed sentries at the hill and put hay bales around trees and pads around posts.
Lawson said cities used to be more universally protected from liability than they are now: "If you went sledding, you understood that it was inherently dangerous and did so at your own risk," he said.

Cities have been successfully sued for millions of dollars following sledding injuries.
In Omaha, Nebraska, $2.4 million went to the family of a 5-year-old who became paralyzed after her sled hit a tree.
The fear of such lawsuits is behind the movement to ban or restrict sledding.
However, for some cities, banning sledding is not that easy.

Four California high schools will be forced to change mascots after Gov.
"This landmark legislation eliminating the R-word in California schools clearly demonstrates that this issue is not going away, and that opposition to the Washington team on this issue is only intensifying," said Oneida Indian Nation Representative Ray Halbritter of the group Change The Mascot, which supported the bill.

The label would read: "STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAFETY WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity), diabetes, and tooth decay."
"The goal of the warning quite simply is to give consumers the right to know what are well-established medical impacts from consuming these beverages," Monning, from Carmel, said in a telephone interview.
CalBev, the California arm of the Washington, D.C.-based American Beverage Association, noted that the industry already posts calorie counts on the front of many beverage containers as part of its "Clear on Calories" campaign that began in 2010.
"We agree that obesity is a serious and complex issue," the group said in a statement, but it called Monning\'s bill "misleading" because it said just 6 percent of calories in the average American\'s diet come from soda, fruit, sports and energy drinks, compared with 11 percent in sweets and deserts.
The group would not put a price tag on complying with the proposed legislation but said the measure would increase the cost of doing business in California.
The warning labels would mesh, he said, with health campaigns and proposed ordinances in several California cities and elsewhere to discourage sugar consumption.
San Francisco, for instance, is considering asking voters to approve a tax on soda and other sweetened drinks, while former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg unsuccessfully pushed proposals to tax soda and ban the sale of large soda containers.
California would become the first state to require warning labels on sodas and other sugary drinks under a proposal a state lawmaker announced Thursday.
SB1000 would require the warning on the front of all beverage containers with added sweeteners that have 75 or more calories in every 12 ounces.
The bill has the backing of the California Medical Association and the California Center for Public Health Advocacy.
The Vermont bill would require manufacturers to put warning labels on beverages that contain sugar or other artificial additives.

Is there a safe time to let your kids play tackle football?
Researchers found that former NFL players who started playing tackle football before age 12 performed an average of 20 percent worse on a series of cognitive tests than those who started playing tackle football after they had celebrated their 12th birthdays.
The players were given a series of cognitive tests.
A memory test, for instance, required the players to remember a list of words immediately after it had been read to them, as well as 15 minutes later.

When is it safe to play tackle football?
A new study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology suggests that kids may want to wait until they are at least 12 years old.
The players were then given a series of cognitive tests.
On all three tests, the players who had started playing tackle football earlier in life performed significantly worse than their counterparts.
He said that the research team chose the age of 12 as the dividing line because it is an important time for the brain.
Studies often try to draw conclusions about the general population by looking at a representative sample group.
It is possible, though, that the sample group will be different in one way or another from the general population.
Given this difference, the results of the study may not apply to other groups of people.
They fell into two groups: half started playing tackle football before they were 12, and the other half started when they were 12 or older.
He said that the research team chose the age of 12 as the dividing line because it is an important time for the brain.
Filley and Bernick suggested that a larger study group would have provided more reliable evidence.

But he said Pew estimates that about 1 percent to 3 percent of the U.S. annual tuna catch would be affected by the plan if it went forward.
"Because our seafood travels through an increasingly long, complex and non-transparent supply chain, there are numerous opportunities for seafood fraud to occur and illegally caught fish to enter the U.S. market," said Beth Lowell, director of Oceana\'s Stop Seafood Fraud campaign.

WASHINGTON\u2014President Barack Obama announced a new marine sanctuary Tuesday that would close a large area of the central Pacific Ocean to fishing and drilling for oil and gas.
It found that 87 percent of the time fish sold as snapper was really another, usually cheaper, fish.
A proposed new sea refuge would close a large area of the central Pacific to fishing and exploration for oil and gas.
Under the plan, the government would take action to solve the problems of pollution, overfishing and acidification of ocean water.
"We\'ll be cutting off one of the world\'s major sources of food and economic growth," he said.
Hastings called the plan an example of how Obama is acting on his own and in secret to make new rules.
The marine refuge is located southwest of Hawaii.
The president of the Boy Scouts of America urged the organization Thursday to reconsider its blanket ban on gay leaders, saying Scouting must keep up with the times on the issue or face "the end of us as a national movement."
He suggested steps to avert what could be an existential threat to the storied organization.
The Scouts have held fast to the ban over the years, even as homosexuality and same-sex marriage have increasingly come to be accepted by the broader American public.
Officials with the National Catholic Committee on Scouting said Thursday evening they were not yet ready to make a statement.
And attorneys have been in touch with others in similar situations in Ohio, Oklahoma and elsewhere, said Josh Schiller, a partner in the firm.
But a recent proliferation of state and local laws explicitly banning discrimination against gays would bolster the legal case against the organization now, Schiller said.
"We\'re very hopeful that the result of Robert Gates\' statement today means that the Boy Scouts are truly looking forward and not backward and that a positive resolution will result for everybody," Schiller said.
The objections to the policy have come not only from outside the Scouts but from within the organization as well.
In his remarks Thursday, Gates said for the first time that the national organization would not take action against local councils that have defied the national policy by hiring gay leaders.

Yet in 2008, CITES made an exception, permitting China to purchase 62 tons of stockpiled ivory from Botswana, South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
"The United States and China commit to enact nearly complete bans on ivory import and export, including significant and timely restrictions on the import of ivory as hunting trophies, and to take significant and timely steps to halt the domestic commercial trade of ivory," the White House announced last month after a series of meetings between Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Barack Obama.
The two countries will cooperate in "joint training, technical exchanges, information sharing, and public education on combating wildlife trafficking, and enhance international law enforcement cooperation in this field," the statement said, without giving a timeline for implementation.
"I feel this is a political decision, but it is definitely a step in the right direction," said Grace Gabriel, Asia regional director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare.
Experts say that one potential snag is the lack of an equivalent ban in Hong Kong.

For the past four years, the $600 million Kepler has been a prolific planet detector from its lonely orbit, fixing its meter-wide lens, a photometer, on stars to detect the subtle dimming that occurs every time a planet passes in front of \u2014 or "transits" \u2014 its sun.
"We really wanted to go the next mile to nail down an Earth and to tell if there are moons," he said.
"We will extend and improve the software \u2026 There are more improvements to be made," Petigura said.
"The signals are there, in the data we have now \u2014 we have to search for them," said William Borucki, a space scientist at NASA\'s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, and the Kepler mission\'s principal investigator.

"We haven\'t seen the most interesting data," said Natalie Batalha, deputy science team leader for the Kepler mission and a professor at San Jose State.
"The extended mission, with extra transits, would have told us that."
The pressure is on such computer experts as Erik Petigura, a UC Berkeley astronomy graduate student who works with Kepler scientist Geoff Marcy to process the data.

When Jose Torres is home with his family, he likes to play mariachi, a style of traditional Mexican music.
A magnet school is a public school that offers special courses, often attracting students from far and wide with special interests and talents.
The programs were introduced by the Mariachi Heritage Foundation, a nonprofit organization that brings mariachi to Chicago public schools.
Music teacher Maria Pulido has noticed how interested parents are in the mariachi program.
Mariachi songs can be fast or slow, and they come from various regions of Mexico.
He bought 450 violins with the money, and in January he hopes to buy additional mariachi instruments and expand to seven more schools.

With the help of a NASA Mars orbiter, scientists have identified deposits of an exotic material known as "impact glass" on Mars.
Unlike the see-through glass we encounter in daily life, this material is dark brown, almost black, and only partly transparent.
Scientists identify different types of rocks on the Martian surface by picking out the unique spectral "fingerprints" these materials leave in sunlight reflected off the planet.
Opaque materials absorb lots of sunlight, so their spectral signatures in reflected light are stronger than the signatures of partially translucent materials like impact glass, explains Briony Horgan, a planetary scientist at Purdue University who was not part of this study.
Consequently, signals from any rocks that might be mixed in with the impact glass easily overwhelm signals from the glass itself.
Cannon overcame this obstacle by fabricating his own artificial Martian impact glass.
By measuring the spectral signal of this imitation impact glass, Cannon, along with Mustard, a professor of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown, knew precisely what to look for on the Martian surface.
"I can state with a pretty high level of confidence that this new study is the first clear detection of impact glass on Mars," says Horgan, who has studied other types of glass deposits on Mars.
The leaves were pristinely preserved down to the cellular level.
"There is no proof that there ever was life on Mars," says planetary scientist Kieren Howard of Kingsborough Community College of the City University of New York, who did not participate in Cannon and Mustard\'s study, but reviewed an earlier version of the paper.
If Mars was once inhabited, however, the remnants of life inside impact glass "might just allow for the reconstruction of ancient environments, like time capsules."
Impact glass is not only good for giving a snapshot of life in the blasting zone at the time of the impact; the glass itself can host microbial life that moves in after the dust has settled.
A group of organisms called chemolithoautotrophs can tunnel into the glass and live off its nutrients.
"These guys were thought to be some of the earliest types of life on Earth, and also thought to be the types of microbes that might persist on other planets," says Haley Sapers of Western University in Ontario.
Although no actual chemolithoautotrophs have ever been sighted wriggling through impact glass on Earth, Sapers says, there is strong evidence that they colonized the impact glass of the 15-million-year-old N\xf6rdlinger Ries crater in Germany.
So, if these tiny tunnels were found in the Martian glass, could that be evidence that the Red Planet was \u2014 or perhaps still is \u2014 home to a fleet of alien microbes?
He then melted his mixture in an oven and allowed it to harden into faux impact glass.
Their search turned up a slew of previously undetected glass deposits in craters across the Martian surface.
According to Schultz, impact glass might similarly capture and preserve bits of organisms on Mars.
So, if these tiny tunnels were found in the Martian glass, could that be evidence that the Red Planet was \u2014 or perhaps still is \u2014 home to a fleet of alien microbes?
Besides, Sapers says that detecting tunnels in the glass would require returning samples to Earth, which would surely kill anything still alive in the glass.

In the annual battle to rid steamy South Florida of swarming summer mosquitoes, new research has found routine spraying may pose a far greater risk to an innocent bystander: butterflies.
Rand, a toxicologist, said his research also shows the need to broaden insect safety testing for pesticides, which currently tests only honeybees.
But so far this year, Vasquez said the district has sprayed just once, at a half dozen parks, before the July 4 holiday.
Permethrin also tended to pose a lasting risk, since it stayed on leaves longer.

In humans, for instance, about 90 percent of babies born with a cervical rib die before they are old enough to reproduce, according to a 2006 study in the journal Evolution.
Reumer and two colleagues looked in the collections of the Natural History Museum and the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, both in the Netherlands, and found 16 samples of mammoth vertebrae from the base of the neck.
Not only were they unusually common, but the shape of the vertebrae suggested the bones were unusually large as well, according to the study.

Rising tension between Russia and the U.S., North Korea\'s recent nuclear test and a lack of aggressive steps to address climate change are putting the world under grave threat, scientists behind a "Doomsday Clock" that measures the likelihood of a global cataclysm said Tuesday.

Of those, 2,866 have been placed in Houston and the surrounding county.
Texas had long served students who were in the country illegally, and a 1982 Supreme Court case held that the state could not deny them an education.
Agency officials estimate that it will pay districts $9,473 to educate each bilingual student this academic year.
If most of the young immigrants placed in Texas enroll in school, the total cost of educating the newcomers could top $50 million.
Those factors include the number of English-as-a-second-language students already in a school and the level of community programs and state support.
Also key is existing enrollment, Nolt said, adding that some urban districts are underenrolled and may have extra capacity.
A year ago, the Las Americas Newcomer Middle School in the low-income Gulfton neighborhood started the semester with 150 immigrant and refugee students.
"It\'s put a burden on me because I\'ve run out of space," Principal Maria Moreno said of the school\'s dozen portable classrooms set up behind another middle school.

The impact of the recent surge of immigration is being felt most strongly in Texas.
More than 66,000 unaccompanied young immigrants crossed into the United States illegally in the past year.
According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, 37,477 of those children have been released to sponsors across the country as of July 31.
Texas has long served students who were in the country illegally, and a 1982 Supreme Court case held that the state could not deny them an education.
Many of these students, Moreno said, are fleeing countries in disorder and need counseling and other social services.

For months, they worked together in the cave where the Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island may have lived.', u'Slowly, painstakingly, they removed bucket after bucket of sand \u2014 40,000 in all.
Navy archaeologist Steve Schwartz was leading the project.
The archaeologist was especially shocked by a blunt question contained in the order: "Is the work you\'re doing out there legal?"
Becoming concerned that the archaeological dig was breaking laws designed to protect cultural resources, Holm brought members of the Pechanga Native American tribe to the island.
Very little is known about the Nicoleno Indians, who, in the early 1800s, suffered huge losses in repeated fights with Russian fur traders and Alaskan sea otter hunters.
After a particularly brutal battle in 1814, the Nicoleno population, which had been about 300, dropped to a few dozen.
In 1835, a ship was sent by Franciscan fathers at the Santa Barbara Mission to bring the few remaining Nicoleno back to the mainland.
All but one made the trip aboard the Peor es Nada \u2014 loosely translated as "better than nothing."
According to legend, a woman jumped overboard and swam for shore after realizing that her baby had been left behind.
Among the losers in the dig shutdown is Holm himself, who says he invested $100,000 in a film project that may never be completed.
In 1853, the woman \u2014 about 50 years old \u2014 was skinning a seal and living in a nearby cave when she was found by Santa Barbara fur traders.
Slowly, painstakingly, they removed bucket after bucket of sand \u2014 40,000 in all.
A travesty," Schwartz said recently.
According to legend, a woman jumped overboard and swam for shore after realizing that her baby had been left behind.
A few weeks later, the tribe sent letters demanding that the Navy stop archaeological research in the cave and at 549 other sites across the island.
"We\'re only trying to do what\'s right by our ancestors," Mark Macarro, the tribe\'s chairman, said in an interview.
For now, at least, the mystery of the Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island will remain unsolved.
Holm felt lucky to be working side-by-side with experts, impressed with their knowledge of the Native Americans who had lived on the island.

SHINGTON - Wild horses are being offered for auction this weekend in Fort Worth, Texas, as part of a desperate effort by a federal government that cannot figure out what to do with them.
These horses are descended from the steeds of Spanish explorers, Native Americans, U.S. cavalry and ranch strays.
They argue that it is really about favoring the interests of ranchers whose cattle and sheep graze upon the public lands.
The Bureau of Land Management pays the Mustang Heritage Foundation $3.75 million to train some of the wild horses and put them up for auction, a program that led to 868 of the adoptions last year.
The foundation is in the midst of an adoption event at the John Justin Arena in Fort Worth, with 150 of the horses going up for bid Friday and the same number Sunday.
The Bureau has a board that advises it on wild horses and burros.
It said the number of horses being held has ballooned to the point that it "threatens the health and welfare of the horses and the entire program."
The board recommended removing female reproductive organs of mares in the field as a population control method.
It could also have vaccines to prevent pregnancies in horses if necessary, said Suzanne Roy, campaign director of the American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign, based in Hillsborough, North Carolina.
A National Academy of Sciences study on the wild horse problem is coming out next month and will heavily influence the debate.
SHINGTON - Wild horses are being offered for auction this weekend in Fort Worth, Texas, as part of a desperate effort by a federal government that cannot figure out what to do with them.
At the same time, the cost to taxpayers of the wild horse program has nearly doubled in the past four years to $75 million, with more than half going to holding costs.

SHINGTON \u2013 The Federal government will be trying to sell wild horses at auction this weekend in Fort Worth, Texas.
The agency is responsible for 264 million acres across the United States.
At the same time, the cost to taxpayers of the program has nearly doubled in the past four years to $75 million, with more than half going to pay for holding the animals.
It will not kill healthy horses if nobody wants to adopt them, even though the law says it can, he said.

The report will also address the question of how the Bureau of Land Management decides how many horses can live on a piece of land.
If the bureau cannot find places for the horses, that could lead to limited roundups.
Biologists have long argued about whether bigger is better.
Will we someday live on a planet of titans?
Breathing becomes a problem, because lungs need to be massive and very efficient to keep supplying the air needed to support such a large body size.
"The fact that only one part of the bird lung was dark suggested the air was flowing in one direction and that the first part of the lung to receive the contaminated air was filtering the particles," said Colleen Farmer, an associate professor of biology at the University of Utah.
She believes that further studies will show that all lizards and snakes are also unidirectional breathers.
"(Unidirectional breathing) appears to be much more common and ancient than anyone thought," she said in a statement.
Little-known fact: When it comes to extracting oxygen from the air we breathe, we humans are just OK.
Then the "old" air moves out of our lungs along the same path it came in.
If the pigeons breathed like we do, scientists would have expected the entire lung to be black.
It is a little-known fact that when it comes to extracting oxygen from the air we breathe, we humans are just OK.
So she worked out that this type of breathing could be important for mixing gases in the lungs during a breath-hold.
"We\'re really looking forward to see how the needle moves," she said.
"Recently we had a woman say, \'I\'m thinking of doing a pie-in-your-face idea.\'
Just a few years ago, she said, only about 50 percent of Americans knew what ALS is.
It was simply trying out a fun way to raise money for the fight against Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.
In many cases, it causes death within three to five years.
As it turned out, the ice bucket campaign has been incredibly successful.
Many are now trying to come up with other ways to connect with a younger generation of potential donors.
It has been extremely viral \u2014 that is, knowledge of it has spread rapidly, from person to person, through the Internet.
They challenge others to do the same \u2014 or to donate money to the ALS Association.
The ice bucket challenge, Gilbert said, is "a very simple thing and that\'s kind of the beauty of it \u2014 everyone can do this challenge."
The station has released 66 apple varieties over more than a century including Cortland, Macoun and two new entries at farm markets this fall: SnapDragon and RubyFrost.
But researchers also want farmer-friendly apples that hold up well against insects, fire blight and apple scab and during shipping.
A green apple that might have been able to compete with the Granny Smith was discarded because it was susceptible to blister spots.
Brown has high hopes for their two new apples developed in partnership with the members of New York Apple Growers, which will initially be sold at dozens of farm markets in New York this fall.
As picking season for SnapDragon dawns, Brown is already thinking of the next generation apple.

The orchards are part of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station.
A green apple that tasted delicious was dropped because it tended to develop blister spots.
RubyFrost is high in vitamin C. It also resists browning, which is important now that apple slices are a popular supermarket item.
One promising variety was rejected because many of its leaves turned spotty.
These will initially be sold at dozens of farm markets in New York this fall.
There are waxy apples, deep-red apples, round apples, oval apples.
On a sunny day this week, she walked through rows of her apple trees and offered fruit to taste.
Another was exceptionally firm and crisp.
That means they must hold up well against insects and tree diseases.

"I am thrilled and humbled to have an opportunity to put on this uniform again and to play Major League Baseball again,\'\' he said.
Baseball issued subpoenas and offered to pay witnesses to help them gather evidence against players suspected of cheating.
The case also ensnared All-Stars Nelson Cruz, Jhonny Peralta and Everth Cabrera.
Some are calling the suspensions the most sweeping punishments since the 1919 Black Sox scandal, which involved a scheme to rig the World Series.
They elected to admit responsibility, sit out their suspensions immediately, and return as quickly as possible to the diamond.
It is possible that Rodriguez and other players could be subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, should the case rise to that level.

The latest suspensions follow the July 22 ban of Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers, who was suspended for the rest of this season.
"We pursued this matter because it was not only the right thing to do, but the only thing to do," Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said.
They all had a connection with Biogenesis, the Miami-area clinic that provided players with banned substances from 2009 until last year.
"The past seven months have been a nightmare \u2014 probably the worst time of my life,\'\' the third baseman and Miami native said.
They chose to admit responsibility, sit out their suspensions immediately, and return as quickly as possible to the diamond.
The League says that he kept using testosterone and human growth hormone (HGH), however.
Weiner said Selig did not "act appropriately\'\' in his case, but did not elaborate.
Twelve other players were given 50-game suspensions.
The announcement by the League on Monday ended a long and hard-hitting look into the matter.
He did not answer questions about his use of banned substances.
The suspension could end his baseball career.
Government lawyers in Miami last week said they were investigating Biogenesis.
His high school coach at Westminster Christian in Miami said it was a sad day.
Rodriguez says MLB and the Yankees are trying to end his career.
But Executive Director Michael Weiner said the union would defend Rodriguez.
As portraits go, it was undeniably arresting, a strong-jawed man in profile wearing a regal Native American war bonnet.
When that picture appeared on the July cover of fashion magazine Elle UK, which was published June 5, the backlash on social media was instant.
Before the outcry, Elle UK bragged on its website that it persuaded the singer to "trade his Vivienne Westwood mountie hat for a Native American feather headdress in his best ever shoot."
In the age of social media, the ire lights up faster and with more passion.
Now, transgressions go viral, as in June when headdresses made headlines during a San Francisco Giants baseball game, on Native American Heritage Night.
After the mainstream attention and online discussions, the Giants added "culturally insensitive" garb to obscene language, abusive behavior and other misdeeds that can get fans thrown out of the stadium.
"It\'s not like I\'m mad at these people," Schilling said.
Every summer hundreds of Native American dancers and drummers from across the country travel to Mayetta, north of Topeka, for the event.
But he tends to give celebrities like Williams and others a pass.

Much of the criticism on Twitter used the hashtag "#NotHappy," a snarky reference to the "Happy" singer\'s monster hit.
Headdresses have deep spiritual and cultural meaning for Native Americans.
"Social media of native people, even though we\'re only 2 percent (of the U.S. population), is so strong and so valiant, that our presence is making change," said Native American journalist Vincent Schilling.
"For decades the only voice we had was to go out and hold up a sign and say we\'re frustrated.
Stadium security stepped in after a Native American man and woman approached a group of nonnative men who had brought a fake, plastic headdress to the game.
Schilling, who is Akwesasne Mohawk, saw so many recent examples of headdresses being used inappropriately that he made a YouTube video last fall called "What Is Native American Misappropriation?"
He begins: "What we\'re seeing now is a pretty big influx of what people are calling native hipsters.
"So for a person to wear a war bonnet who didn\'t earn it would be the exact same thing as somebody wearing a Purple Heart or Medal of Honor who did not earn it."
So he looks at the situation with "bemusement because, let\'s face it, as Native Americans we are living in a dominant society, a society dominated by nonnatives, and it\'s going to be like that for a long time."

"It was their symbol of leadership, and each of those feathers was earned and shows their position of leadership," Zotigh said.
"This is very analogous to the modern warrior who earns a medal for their service during wartime," Zotigh said.
"So for a person to wear a war bonnet who didn\'t earn it would be the exact same thing as somebody wearing a Purple Heart or Medal of Honor who did not earn it."
The portrait of the strong-jawed man in profile wearing a proud Native American war bonnet was undeniably arresting.
But the man in the headdress was singer Pharrell Williams, who is not, as far as anyone knew, Native American.
The picture appeared on the July cover of fashion magazine Elle UK, which was published June 5.
Now, offensive acts go viral.

group representing minority coaches is calling on the NCAA to adopt a rule that would require its member schools to interview a candidate of color for all head coaching and leadership vacancies.
That includes all four teams that made it to the playoff \u2014 Alabama, Clemson, Oklahoma and Michigan State.
Lapchick has long advocated that the NCAA adopt a rule similar to the NFL rule, and he named it after Robinson, the revered coach at Grambling State who died in 2007\\.
He called the endorsement from NAFCED "an enormous boost" that he hopes will help the proposal gain traction.
We\'re going through a very critical stage here, and we need a lot of different ideas, a lot of different thoughts, a lot of different perspectives so we can arrive at the best place for the game and the kids who play the game."
The biggest question will be whether the NCAA, or any other governing body, can enforce the rules on such a wide swath of public and private institutions.
Lapchick said he thinks legislative action would be more compelling than any perceived punishment that the NCAA could hand out.
When NAFCED held its inaugural meeting in Atlanta last summer, Hewitt was initially reluctant to push for such a rule because he was concerned it might be viewed as "self-serving."
That especially applies to basketball and football for Hewitt, who believes they are held to a different standard than other sports such as baseball and hockey.

Robinson was the revered coach at Grambling State University in Louisiana who died in 2007\\.
Well-known members include Texas Tech University basketball coach Tubby Smith and Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson III.
Before the college football season began, his organization released a study.
That includes all four teams that made it to the playoffs.
The question will be whether the NCAA can make so many public and private colleges follow the rule.
He was concerned that people might think he was supporting it only because he was recently fired by George Mason University and was looking for a new job.
The technology maps the entire DNA sequence of a microbe, and allows scientists to distinguish one strain from another, allowing fast track-back and earlier elimination of outbreaks around the world.
The zoom-in detail of a sequenced genome will make it possible to distinguish different strains of a microbe that are otherwise indistinguishable, and trace back a small cluster outbreak before it becomes widespread.
Using whole genome sequencing, researchers were able to double the number of cases associated with a known 2010 outbreak of a strain of salmonella called salmonella Heidelberg at a long-term care facility in New York City.
They even found cases outside the metro region.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigated the plant and found 10 sanitation slip-ups, including four outright violations of safety protocols.
In 2014 the FDA was able to halt a U.S. Listeria outbreak that had killed one and sickened seven others.
Davis microbiologist Bart Weimer, says that "We\'ve just extended the project to China, and they will map another 10,000 genomes and deposit them.
Sequencing a whole genome is only one of the new approaches to food safety, however.
The technology consists of DNA sequences extracted from plants; it is an odorless, colorless and tasteless material that can be mixed with already-in-use food coatings (such as natural waxes and oils) and sprayed on foods.
So the day may not be far off when we can hold our phones over a fish fillet to make sure we know what we are eating.

An apple can kill, a sprinkle of sprouts can send you to the hospital and your delicious, pan-seared red snapper may actually be a different fish altogether.
The new plan promises to speed investigations and reduce foodborne illnesses and deaths.
The techniques could also spot fake food.
Using whole genome sequencing, researchers were able to find double the number of cases from a 2010 salmonella outbreak at a long-term health care facility in New York City.
In 2012, researchers isolated the specific strain in a salmonella outbreak in tuna sushi that made 258 people sick.
Davis microbiologist Bart Weimer, said, "We\'ve just extended the project to China, and they will map another 10,000 genomes and deposit them."
Food fraud prevention is also benefiting from a large international project called the International Barcode of Life (iBOL).
The DNA sequences act like invisible bar codes and can be applied at different points where food is moved: the farm, the sorting facility, the distributor, the packer and even the retailer.
"When an outbreak occurs," said company founder Anthony Zografos, the tags can be read in about 20 minutes.
An apple can kill, a sprinkle of sprouts can send you to the hospital and your delicious, pan-seared red snapper may actually be a different fish altogether.
The project is building a genetic library of all life on Earth.
The iBOL can already distinguish farmed from wild salmon because they are two different species.

The food can then be traced back to where it came from immediately, not in weeks or months like before, he said.

Scientists are coming up with ways to use DNA to help protect people from diseases in food.
They are also trying to map, or sequence, the most common bacteria or other tiny disease-causers called pathogens.

When it comes to squeezing tiny, individual living cells out into orderly patterns for lab experiments, scientists usually use inkjet printers, but those have their limits.
The retro technique, described in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could significantly improve the survival rates of living cells and allow scientists to effectively print a variety of animal cells in a variety of shapes on just about any surface.
They could also print cells just 5 micrometers apart \u2013 not a bad resolution, given that cells are about 10 to 30 micrometers wide.
When it comes to squeezing tiny, individual living cells out into orderly patterns for lab experiments, scientists usually use inkjet printers, but those have their limits.
The mold is pressed onto a surface and then lifted away, leaving a pattern of cells in place.
They could also print cells just 5 micrometers apart \u2013 not a bad resolution, given that cells are about 10 to 30 micrometers wide.
But it could potentially be cheaper, the researchers said: The materials to make each mold cost roughly $1, while an inkjet cell printer can cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Normally when it comes to squeezing tiny, individual living cells out into orderly patterns for lab experiments, scientists use inkjet printers.
Scientists call the new form of printing "block-cell printing," or BloC-Printing for short.
They found that their ancient and yet novel process could be done as quickly as in half an hour and with close to 100 percent of cells surviving undamaged.
They could also print cells just 5 micrometers apart \u2013 impressive, given that most animal cells are about 10 to 30 micrometers wide.
Scientists noticed that her cells were different from others and could be kept alive and grow.
Her cells have been copied countless times and used by scientists all around the world in experiments.
But that system has its limits, so scientists have turned to Chinese woodblock printing in order to find a solution.
The ancient printing system has proven to have benefits in the modern world.
Woodblock printing also gives scientists more options.
And cells have just a 50 percent to 80 percent chance of staying alive when using inkjet printing.
Little hooks were regularly spaced along the sides of the canals of the silicone stamps.
Vacuum pressure was used to suck it through to the other side of the woodblock-like mold.
The hooks were perfect for snagging single cells as they flew by through the fluid.
The mold is then pressed onto a surface and lifted away, leaving a pattern of cells in place.
Scientists usually use inkjet printers to squeeze tiny, individual living cells out into orderly patterns for lab experiments.
He said that woodblock printing is a useful and convenient technology "that revolutionized the printing world."
Then they watched how they connect and share information.

Okwu, who is African-American, is among 26 students from a variety of backgrounds who took part in a program at the University of Washington this summer aimed at broadening the diversity of students who choose careers in conservation and ecology.
Students who go into conservation jobs often have a passion for nature and a mind for science, said Sean Watts, director of the summer program called Conservation Scholars.
But they may lack people skills or the flexibility to consider an issue from different policy and social perspectives.
And while most of them were planning to major in environmental sciences, the group also included students majoring in film studies, mechanical engineering, applied mathematics, business and economics.
"Climate change is going to be global, and it\'s important to take diverse viewpoints into account," said Jordan Morgan, a white student from Bemidji State University in Minnesota.
Two other schools, Northern Arizona University and the University of Florida, also received Duke Foundation money to run programs this summer.
For example, the students visited an organic apple farm, and met an older white farmer who employed migrant workers to pick his fruit.
Watts said challenging the way students think about the world means "it was tense at times \u2014 you don\'t get to those conversations without a little tension," he said.
This same group of students will return to the UW for two more summers, in 2015 and 2016, even as a new cohort will join the program next year.
The concern: More than 80 percent of people in conservation jobs \u2014 like the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and private groups such as the Nature Conservancy \u2014 are white, and come from similar socioeconomic backgrounds.
Students who go into conservation jobs often have a passion for nature and a mind for science, said Sean Watts, director of the summer program called Conservation Scholars.
Some had parents who never graduated from high school, and others came from families where both parents went to graduate school.
During the program, the students crisscrossed Washington state, from the slopes of Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens to the dry grasslands of the Moses Coulee in Eastern Washington.
"Business has been one of the biggest polluters of the environment; I really want to change that," said Eric Katz, a business major at the University of Michigan.
The students noted that climate change is expected to have some of its most devastating effects on the poorest regions of the planet.

They visited the Elwha dam-removal project, saw the Duwamish River and the Pacific coastline.
Watts hopes to getting more students from all backgrounds interested in conservation at the start of their college studies.
It is caused by humans burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal.

Steven Harris is studying earth sciences and anthropology at Syracuse University.
People working in conservation, though, tend to be pretty similar.
For example, the students visited an organic apple farm, and met an older white farmer who employed immigrant workers to pick his fruit.
At first, the students thought the farmer had something to hide.
Nearly 400 people applied to the program.

By the end of the eight-week program, Okwu loved the outdoor field trips.
Now, he is thinking about making conservation part of his job after college.
Islamic State militants have provoked a global outcry by attacking ancient monuments with jackhammers and bulldozers.
"They steal everything that they can sell, and what they can\'t sell, they destroy," said Qais Hussein Rasheed, Iraq\'s deputy minister for antiquities and heritage.
Anything genuine and small enough to move was likely sold off or stockpiled by the militants, they said.
The sacking of the poorly guarded national museum in Baghdad after the U.S. invasion in 2003 was decried around the world.
Danti, who advises the State Department on the trade in plundered antiquities from Iraq and Syria, said some looted items have made their way to U.S. and other Western markets \u2014 especially antiquities in the lower- and medium-price ranges, such as stone seals with cuneiform inscriptions.
But the market is poorly regulated and the Archaeological Institute of America estimates that as much as 90 percent of classical artifacts in collections may be stolen antiquities.
Smaller items from Iraq and Syria are now "flooding the market" and are widely sold online, said Deborah Lehr, the co-founder of the Antiquities Coalition, which aims to end "cultural racketeering."
In Baghdad, officials say they are doing what they can to stem the flow, but Islamic State is utilizing decades-old smuggling networks that sprung up as the robbery of artifacts increased.
The U.S.-led invasion in 2003 brought more looting, with sites left completely unprotected.
In the same compound as his office is the national museum, recently reopened to the public for the first time since 2003 in what officials described as an act of defiance against Islamic State destruction.

"Space is hard and today was a tough day," said George Whitesides, the CEO of Virgin Galactic.
A California Highway Patrol spokesman said two people were found near the crash site in the desert north of California City and east of Mojave.
The crash was the second disaster in the commercial space industry in a week.
Stuart Witt is CEO and general manager of Mojave Space and Air Port, where Virgin conducted its testing.
He reserved his ticket four years ago with a 10 percent deposit and says he still wants to take the trip.
A plane made to take paying customers to the edge of space and back crashed Friday during testing.
One test pilot was killed and another was injured.
"Space is hard and today was a tough day," said George Whitesides, the CEO of Virgin Galactic.
One of the pilots had used a parachute to escape the aircraft.
The crash was the second disaster in the commercial space industry in a week.
No one was injured in that explosion.
He did not say when that would happen.
The company planned to charge $250,000 for the experience.
A plane headed to the edge of space crashed during a test on Friday and broke into several pieces.

What happens when you take about 50 sixth-graders and send them to a nature camp with no access to computers, tablets and mobile phones?
When the class of about 50 children arrived at the camp, they were asked to take two tests to measure their ability to read nonverbal social cues.
In the first, the kids were asked to assess the emotions portrayed in 48 photos of people making faces.
At the end of the five-day camp, the students were asked to take the tests again.
The researchers report that over the five days the kids went from making an average of 14.02 errors on the face-recognition test at the beginning of their camp stay to 9.41 errors by the end.
The researchers gave the same test to a control group of 54 sixth-graders from the same school who had not yet attended the camp.
"I love media, my kids are media-savvy, but it is really important to have a balance."

The researchers gave the same test to a control group of 54 sixth-graders from the same school who had not yet attended the camp.
There may be a new reason to look forward to camping trips.
A new study of about 50 sixth-graders suggests that their ability to read nonverbal social cues can improve after just five days at a nature camp.
Researchers have wondered if children are losing the ability to read these important cues.
Uhls and professor Patricia Greenfield found a sixth-grade class that goes to a wilderness camp in Southern California for five days.
When the class of about 50 children arrived at the camp, they took two tests to measure their ability to read nonverbal social cues.
In the first, the kids were asked to judge the emotions in 48 photos of people making faces.
The researchers gave the same test to 54 sixth-graders from the same school who had not yet attended the camp.
Students in the control group got an average of 28 percent of the emotions correct both times they were tested.
"I love media, my kids are media-savvy, but it is really important to have a balance," Uhls said.
The new tags are like "a smartphone for marine animals," said Marco Flagg, CEO of Desert Star, a Marina, Calif., company that offers the solar devices.
The Guy Harvey Research Institute, based in Dania Beach, Fla., is looking to use the solar tags to track certain species of the fierce fish, including tigers, makos, hammerheads, oceanic white tip and sand sharks.
Technically called "pop-up archival satellite tags," the devices can gather an enormous amount of information, so much that batteries alone would die before all the data is transmitted, Shivji said.
Solar powered or not, tags already have provided researchers with detailed information on the migratory patterns and daily habits of different fish.
The overall success of solar tags has yet to be proven because of their relatively limited use.
That information is then transmitted to researchers.
From tracking several sharks around the world, "we\'ve discovered remarkable data on the behavior of these animals in terms of their movement horizontally as well as vertically," Shivji said.
Researchers are looking to the sun to give hunted and overfished sharks a new ray of hope.

There were hidden newsreel cameras, secret radio broadcasts and flashbulb bursts.
Some courts eventually loosened the reins, though others still ban cameras.
The prolonged media spectacle, however, was sharply criticized after Simpson was found not guilty.

Committing on Twitter to a school is also discouraged \u2014 one recent former player tweeted commitments to four different schools without informing any coaches.
Social media have become more ubiquitous, and that helps coaches fill the information gap in recruiting.
"In the transition from being a little kid to a man, that\'s the thing you have to do, because when you\'re growing up, you probably want to get a big time job somewhere and they look back at your Twitter account and they see the things you\'re putting out," Lammons said.
At Penn State media day last week, Hand said his wife scolded him for the tone of the tweet.
This is about as obvious as it gets about what kind of thing we\'re dealing with here, so we backed out altogether," he said.
"If they\'re not going to take coaching on this, what are they going to do on third-and-short when you need them to make a block and they kind of do their own deal?"

De Blasio, who hails from Brooklyn, reached out to New Yorkers he contended were left behind by the often Manhattan-centric Bloomberg administration, and he called for a tax increase on the wealthy to pay for universal pre-kindergarten.
He charged that a Blasio victory would return the city to its crime-filled past, a point he made with a TV ad that depicted graphic images of violence from decades ago.
The candidate, a white man married to a black woman, also received a boost from a campaign ad featuring their son, a 15-year-old with a big Afro.
But his campaign struggled out of the gate, and he was slow to raise money.
Voters in New York City elected their first Democratic mayor in two decades on Tuesday, choosing Bill de Blasio, who ran on a liberal, tax-the-rich platform.
He railed against economic inequality and portrayed New York as a "tale of two cities" \u2014 one rich, the other working class \u2014 under the pro-business, pro-development mayor.
His campaign enjoyed a surge when a federal judge ruled that police had unfairly singled out blacks and Hispanics under the policy.
De Blasio worked for both Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Gov.
De Blasio also pledged to improve economic opportunities in minority and working-class neighborhoods.
But those same surveys revealed the city was hungry for a change.

Should you have to hold Christian beliefs to lead a Christian student group?
A new policy at California State University says no, and it is sparking a national debate.
InterVarsity Christian Fellowship is a national Christian organization for college students.
As a result, it has found itself in a standoff with Cal State and other universities that require student groups must be open to all.
Under the new all-comers policy, a student can join any student group regardless of his or her personal background.
They cannot participate in official student fairs or receive money from campus student associations.
InterVarsity members consider the new policy unfair.
For some in InterVarsity, not signing the all-comers policy was a matter of principle.
"I don\'t think a non-Christian would want to be a leader in a Christian group," said Cal State Long Beach student Jasmine Kim.
The policy does not just apply to religion, however.
It says that no student can be shut out based on his or her background or beliefs.
A white undergraduate could lead the Chinese Student Association.
Since then, universities have become tougher on groups that are not open to everyone.
Some legal scholars say that what is happening to religious groups on college campus is happening across the country.

Daniela Polencheck met her biggest hurdle when she was still a toddler growing up in Colombia.
Noushin Ajmeri hails from eastern India and said she had to adjust to how brashly American girls behaved when her family moved to the United States two years ago.
"You need to be confident and you need to expect the best of yourself, be social and try to assimilate.
The 18-year-old said she felt loads of frustration when her family moved from Zacapa, Guatemala, to Glendale Heights, Illinois, in April 2013.

Julia A. Pierson, the director of the Secret Service, resigned on Wednesday following a string of high-profile security lapses.
"Over the last several days, we\'ve seen recent and accumulating reports raising questions about the performance of the agency," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest.
The gun was discovered only after agents complained the guard was acting oddly.
According to court papers, Gonzalez, 42, climbed over the north fence of the White House at 7:19 p.m. on Sept. 19.
He allegedly knocked over an agent inside the door and wrestled with guards who chased him into the East Room.
She could give no good reason why agents failed to stop Gonzalez before he entered the executive mansion, and why an alarm was muted.
She also had trouble explaining why the agency did not acknowledge for more than a week that Gonzalez had forced his way deep inside the building before he was tackled.
In fact, he carried a black folding knife in his pocket, the agency later acknowledged.
Investigators also found hundreds of rounds of ammunition for shotguns, pistols and rifles in his car, which was parked nearby.

She could give no good reason why agents failed to stop Gonzalez before he entered the White House.
In fact, he carried a black folding knife in his pocket, the agency later admitted.
According to court papers, Gonzalez climbed over the north fence of the White House at 7:19 p.m.
He then allegedly knocked over an agent inside the door and wrestled with guards who chased him into the East Room.
She could give no good reason why agents failed to stop Gonzalez before he entered the White House.
Gonzalez knocked over an agent stationed just past the second door.
A man armed with a pistol rode in an elevator with Obama.
The man may not have planned to attack Obama.
He worked as guard elsewhere, and was allowed to carry a gun for his job.
Still, it was a serious mistake to let him get near the president with the gun still on him.
In fact, she was named as its director because of earlier problems.
For example, in 2011 a man was able to shoot at the White House.
She could give no good reason why agents did not stop Gonzalez before he entered the White House.
If he is found guilty, he could spend up to 16 years in prison.
Almost four years after the MV-22 Osprey arrived in Afghanistan, trailing a reputation as dangerous and hard to maintain, the U.S. Marine Corps finally has had an opportunity to test the controversial hybrid aircraft in real war conditions.
"It is still probably more expensive than it should be, and more expensive to operate.
The odd aircraft, which takes off and lands like a helicopter but rotates its engines forward to fly like an airplane, had a star-crossed development period that took more than two decades and included huge cost overruns and crashes that claimed 30 lives.
"The Osprey has proven itself in Afghanistan in a way it didn\'t in Iraq," he said.
Among the recent missions the squadron has flown was one in which the Osprey showed its strengths: A Marine with a head wound at a distant base needed to be moved to a second distant base for quick treatment.
A conventional helicopter would have been hard-pressed to do the same, even without the 40-mile run from Bastion, Sanders said.
Ulsh noted that last month the first of 12 Ospreys joined the fleet of aircraft used for presidential travel, a significant endorsement of the aircraft.
That, McCain said, more than doubled the cost per hour of flight, to more than $10,000, compared with about $4,600 for the CH-46.
Almost four years after the MV-22 Osprey arrived in Afghanistan, trailing a reputation as dangerous and hard to maintain, the U.S. Marine Corps finally has had an opportunity to test the controversial hybrid aircraft in real war conditions.
"This is an ugly duckling that turned into a swan," said Richard Whittle, the author of "The Dream Machine: The Untold History of the Notorious V-22 Osprey" and a senior scholar at the Wilson Center, a research center in Washington.
"Partly that was because it didn\'t get the chance in Iraq.

They picked up the wounded man and flew another 75 miles or so east to the massive coalition base in Kandahar, all in under an hour from the moment they got the call.
In a speech in December 2011, McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Osprey engines had been lasting just over 200 hours each, well below the 500 to 600 hours the Marines had expected.

They fly it for everything from freight to hundreds of assaults, where it has carried loads of Marines into or out of landing zones, often under intense fire.
It is twice as fast as the helicopter it replaces, has substantially greater range, and can carry more cargo and more than twice as many troops.
Among the recent missions the squadron has flown was one in which the Osprey showed its strengths: a Marine with a head wound at a distant base needed to be moved for quick treatment.
The crew dashed for the Osprey and zoomed north some 40 miles.
The rate for Class A flight mishaps  - those that involve death or permanent disability and/or more than $2 million in damage - is 1.48 per 100,000 hours of flying time since the aircraft was declared operational in 2007, according to Marine Corps spokesman Capt.
That is slightly worse than the rate for the CH-46 medium-lift helicopter, but Whittle said it compared well, pointing out that in the last decade, the military has lost about 420 helicopters and more than 600 people in them, while the Osprey has had three fatal crashes since 2001, killing six.
They cost $122.5 million each, according to Sen. John McCain, a longtime critic.
It also is not cheap to repair, particularly in harsh operating environments such as the wildly dusty south of Afghanistan.

In California, however, similar plans have run into heavy opposition.
Despite those defeats, proponents say the time has finally arrived for Californians to accept direct potable reuse as a partial solution to their growing water insecurity.
Recently, a leader in the effort to stop the Los Angeles project more than a decade ago said he still opposed it but might consider a new plan if officials made a solid case for it.
They note that more than 200 wastewater treatment plants already discharge effluent into the Colorado River, which is a primary source of drinking water for Southern California.
"That\'s what I call de facto potable reuse," said George Tchobanoglous, a water treatment expert and professor emeritus at the University of California, Davis.
The result is a purified substance that is cleaner than most bottled waters, according to WateReuse California, a group that advocates for water reuse and desalination.
However, it is still sent to a traditional water treatment plant, where it is blended with other sources of water, processed and pumped to household taps.
The presence of so-called contaminants of emerging concern may prove to be one of the main barriers to direct potable reuse.
Said Chan: "This just goes to show how the yuck factor can stick with some people."
"That water is discharged into the ocean and lost forever," said Tim Quinn, executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies.
"You know, toilet to tap might be the only answer at this point," said Van Nuys activist Donald Schultz.
First, the water is passed through a microfilter that blocks particles, protozoans or bacteria that are larger than 1/300th the thickness of a human hair.
However, Oppenheimer said he would use such water for irrigation, and even household cleaning and bathing.

However, Oppenheimer said he would use such water for irrigation, and even household cleaning and bathing.
Said Chan: "This just goes to show how the yuck factor can stick with some people."
With Governor Jerry Brown ordering a 25-percent cut in water use in some areas, the solution makes sense, they say, particularly for large coastal cities such as Los Angeles.
Next, it undergoes even finer filtration via a process called reverse osmosis: water is forced through a membrane that blocks fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, viruses and salts.
In the third step, ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide are used to break down any disease-causing bacteria or organic compounds that escaped the first two steps.
There it is blended with other sources of water, processed and pumped to household taps.
Coastal cities flush hundreds of billions of gallons of treated sewage into the Pacific Ocean each year.
"This just goes to show how the yuck factor can stick with some people," said Chan.
Experts say there is an effective way to help California deal with its long-running drought.

Allison Chan, an expert on potable reuse projects, said that many people become more supportive of such programs as they learn more about them.
However, the opposite is true for others \u2014 they become even more opposed.
William Howard Taft, the heaviest president in U.S. history, grew so tired of being ridiculed about his weight that he told his physician to put him on a diet, noting that "no real gentleman weighs more than 300 pounds."

"They said you could build your own game and I said, \'Great!
Maybe I can do (game design) in the future,\'" Taplet, 17, said recently after creating a simple Star Wars-themed program during a schoolwide coding event.
Computer science is one of the fastest-growing and most lucrative sectors of the American economy, and qualified workers are so scarce that half a million jobs remain unfilled, according to the federal government.
Plenty of challenges stand in the way, from finding enough qualified teachers to convincing administrators to invest in a subject that is not covered by standardized tests.
To broaden that base, a nonprofit called Code.org is trying to get the subject into every American school, starting in kindergarten.
"The enjoyable part is just creating something that I want to create," he said.
There are a lot of jobs out there dealing with coding and computer science itself, but people don\'t know about (those disciplines)."
"They said you could build your own game and I said, \'Great!
"I\'ve seen simple games like Flappy Bird make so much money, and all (their creators) did is learn how to code.
Computer programming is a skill that is increasingly seen as a ticket to the good life.
"They said you could build your own game and I said, great!
A survey commissioned by Google found that 3 out of 4 middle and high schools do not offer coding classes.
"I\'ve never worked in any project where there\'s been so much excitement," said Brenda Wilkerson, the district\'s computer science program manager.
The company also withstood criticism after it turned down a takeover offer from Facebook in 2013 for $3 billion, a sum that seemed absurd at the time.
The company, already a behemoth in China, aims to become a bigger player in the U.S. in both online shopping and content creation.
But Spiegel returned to Stanford University and Murphy to a job in San Francisco.
It has raised at least $500 million more since then.

Beitashour went on to the play at San Diego State, then spent four years with the San Jose Earthquakes of MLS before being sold to Vancouver in January.
Meanwhile, Beitashour just wants to play in a World Cup.
The World Cup happens once every four years.
"It\'s the biggest stage and the best players (are) playing there," says Beitashour, a former Major League Soccer (MLS) all-star who plays right back for the Vancouver Whitecaps.
Beitashour first played for Iran in an Asian Cup qualifier last October.

Louisiana residents may go gaga over Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell and Kate Hudson when they arrive in the state later this year to film a movie about the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion.
The movie is being made in Louisiana largely because the state offers unlimited tax credits to entice film companies to shoot on location there.
They point to numerous studies (except those commissioned by the film industry) which show that states never recoup the tax revenue they give away with the credits.
Louisiana currently has no limit on the value of the credits it will give out in a given year.
With the state facing a $1.6 billion budget shortfall, Louisiana legislators are considering a slew of bills that would reduce or eliminate many tax credits that are draining the treasury.
According to a report by the Alaska Department of Commerce, filmmakers received over $38 million in tax credits between June 2009 and June 2013.
A Massachusetts Department of Revenue report showed that in 2012 only about $50 million of the $304 million in spending by the film industry went to Massachusetts vendors.
California, worried about the incentives other states are using to lure Hollywood productions, last year tripled to $330 million the amount available for film tax breaks.
And Maine, which has limited film incentives, now is considering a 25 percent credit for wages paid to residents employed by film productions and a 15 percent credit on wages paid to non-Maine residents.
For example, Netflix\'s "House of Cards" last year threatened to pull production out of Maryland until the state extended its generous tax credit program, which gave out $62.5 million in credits between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, mostly to "House of Cards" and HBO\'s "Veep."

With their heavy tanks of compressed air, hoses, gauges, wetsuits, fins and masks, divers seem more like astronauts than ballerinas.
For a start, dancers \u2014 including those with mobility problems \u2014 had to learn to dive, and control their buoyancy through their breathing to the point where they can hover upside down and sideways, or rise and fall without moving a muscle.

High on a hill overlooking the Mirabello Bay and what the poet Homer called the "wine dark sea," work resumed in June uncovering an ancient city that had been lost for millennia on the island of Crete.
"It\'s fun whacking away," quipped Chelsea Bright, a rising senior at Duke University who plans to become an archaeologist.
Haggis and his partner in the project, Margaret Mook of Iowa State University, were convinced from pottery they found that the site was much older than initially thought.
Because no one has been able to decipher the language of the Cretans of this period, much of their history is a blank slate that can only be interpreted from what is dug up from the ground.
The dig also uncovered what is called the Monumental Civic Building, a large hall with a stepped bench built into the walls and an adjoining two-room shrine including small divinity dolls.
They suggest that the men ate together \u2014 a sort of early fraternal organization perhaps with some military significance.

"It\'s fun whacking away," quipped Duke University student Chelsea Bright, who plans to become an archaeologist.
Each year, college students \u2014 most of them future archaeologists \u2014 do field work at Azoria.
In June, high on a hill overlooking Mirabello Bay, the digging once again resumed.
Digging is only allowed for six weeks per year, but Haggis has been at it since 2002.
Today on the hilltop, there are a couple of dozen students, archaeologists and Greek workers.
"It\'s fun whacking away," joked Duke University student Chelsea Bright, who plans to become an archaeologist.
Azoria was a small city, with an estimated population of 2,000 to 5,000 people.
It is the first time, said Haggis, that two large public buildings of the period have been unearthed.
Each year, American students \u2014 most of them future archaeologists \u2014 do field work at Azoria.
Cassidy has revved up a social media campaign in an effort to win the homecoming crown at Marina High School in Huntington Beach, joining a growing but still-thin group of transgender teens across the country who see an opportunity to shake up gender norms by competing in what has long been a tradition-bound, sex-segregated American staple.
"I didn\'t just change physically; everything changed," she said.
# Story Update SANTA ANA, Calif.\u2014Cassidy Lynn Campbell broke down in tears Friday night when she learned that she had been crowned homecoming queen.
She kind of broke down on the podium," Delapp said of Cassidy.
"I don\'t want her to be who she is, and my religion says it\'s wrong," said her mother, a self-described born-again Christian.
Her mother will accompany her onto the field if Cassidy is a finalist.
Cassidy believes she has a good shot at being crowned.
At halftime, school district spokesman Tom Delapp said, the five finalists were called up and balloons were released from a box to announce the winner\u2014white for the princesses and bright yellow and blue for the queen.
As far back as Cassidy can remember she was drawn to dolls and pink dresses.
During her freshman year she started watching YouTube videos made by transgender women.
One night, about three months ago, she came clean to her mom.
Now the high school senior sees it as a chance to make a statement about gender.
She briefly identified as transgender in middle school, but the term seemed to confuse her peers and succeeded in turning her into an outcast, so she just told classmates she was gay.
On a few occasions during that year and the next, she went to school in a dress or skirt.
Hormone blockers can help prevent her body from maturing into that of a fully developed male.
"I didn\'t just change physically, everything changed," she said.
Cassidy believes she has a good shot at being crowned homecoming queen.
On a few occasions during that year and the next, she went to school in a dress or skirt.
"This year," she said, stroking her long black hair at the kitchen table in her home, "I\'m a girl every day."
She even worries about being attacked because of her new identity.
On Halloween of her sophomore year Cassidy dressed up as a girl.
But, there is the possibility of blood clots and liver damage, said Johanna Olson.
A crowd favorite and the youngest speller, Hussain A. Godhrawala, 8, of Barnwell, South Carolina, seemed overwhelmed with joy when he got his word relating to nails or claws: unguiculate.
Nine-year-old Kasey Cuenca Torres of San Angelo, Texas, got a rousing reaction to his winning word phaeton, an open automobile.
Instead of asking for languages of origin, parts of speech, or definitions, Nicole Seman, 13, of Leesburg, Virginia, Madeline Rickert, 13, of Minot, North Dakota, and Zander Reed, 11, of Ankeny, Iowa, went straight to correctly spelling their words: Faustian, connoisseur and Holstein, respectively.
Some spellers were clearly relieved at getting such common words as lieutenant, poignant, pyre, escargot, rapport, visceral, dichotomy and mistletoe, but also seemed to welcome such head-scratchers as galjoen (a sport fish of Africa), roodebok (a small antelope) and schottische (a polka-like dance).
Ed Horan, 14, of Hoboken, New Jersey, had the crowd breathless as he appeared stumped by the word for puppets moved by overhead strings, then nailed fantoccini.
Some of the words few use in conversation have become standards that the students have heard year after year befalling their predecessors, such as mandir (a Hindu temple), quisling (a turncoat), jeremiad (an angry tirade) foggara (an underground conduit for carrying water), tarragon (an aromatic spice), Baedeker (travel guidebooks), and bobbejaan (an Afrikaans word for baboon).

The McCluer Pommies, a team of 12 at McCluer High School in suburban Florissant, near Ferguson, Missouri, take their job of spreading spirit at the high school and in the community seriously.
Longtime coaches Rega Wesley-Stewart and Jackie Allen want to keep up the momentum of the competition dance team at McCluer High after strong showings in recent years, including first place in two categories at a recent competition against 40 area teams.
Students say being a Pommie is seen as an honor and a lot of work.
The girls have sold pizza, tumblers and spirit wear.

When children and teenagers break the law, they sometimes have to spend time behind bars in special detention centers for young people.
It can be a difficult place to grow up but Budnick, and volunteers like him, try to help.
It might be hard to imagine why kids in juvenile hall would want to be in a writing class.
One reason is that they miss out on the chance to attend regular school.
Another reason is that being in juvenile hall may bring up strong feelings.
Writing can allow prisoners to express feelings like anger and guilt in a healthy way.
For example, Budnick had one class read a newspaper article about Steven Czifra.
Czifra is now a college student at the University of California in Berkeley.
A 16-year-old boy named Antonio spent more than a year in juvie and took writing classes with Budnick.
But Gene Iredale, a San Diego lawyer, said the problem could mean that agencies such as the FBI are "making decisions in criminal cases and are taking away security clearances on the basis of completely inaccurate information.
A spokeswoman said the bureau, which has polygraphed applicants since 1994, "continues to find it a relevant and necessary tool in both employment and operational related matters."
The first polygrapher said the woman seemed to be lying about drug use.
After she was granted another test, the second polygrapher said she passed.
Thousands of job applicants come to FBI offices all across the country every year, eager to work for the top law enforcement agency in the United States.
"I was called a lazy, lying, drug dealing junkie by a man who doesn\'t know me, my stellar background or my societal contributions," wrote one black applicant in Baltimore, who said he was told he qualified for a job except for his polygraph test failure.
The company also points out that other polygraphs that use the same technology might have the problem as well.
Records obtained by McClatchy show the FBI polygraphs about 13,000 people a year for job screening, criminal investigations and national security inquiries.
According to records, the bureau has at least a 30-percent failure rate in its job screening.
"If we feel somebody is deceptive based on the totality of the circumstances, then we can\'t hire them."
James Wedick, a retired FBI agent of 34 years who\'s now a private investigator in Sacramento, called the bureau one of the "worst culprits" in its reliance on polygraph testing.
"I believe I was discriminated against as a black female," wrote one woman who applied to the Memphis, Tennessee, FBI office and was told she\'d failed two polygraphs.

SHINGTON \u2013 Thousands of job seekers come to FBI offices all across the country every year, only to be turned away from the top U.S. law enforcement agency.
Experts say polygraph testing does not reliably show when somebody is actually lying, especially when they are applying for a job.
"I was called a lazy, lying, drug-dealing junkie by a man who doesn\'t know me, my stellar background or my societal contributions," one applicant in Baltimore wrote.
He said he was told he qualified for a job except for the polygraph test.

The Bureau is not alone in its reliance on polygraph testing.
The Philadelphia Police Department says on its website that it will not hire someone who does not pass its polygraph.
Other police departments say they do not rely entirely on a polygraph test to determine whether they should hire someone.
James Wedick, a retired FBI agent of 34 years who is now a private investigator in Sacramento, called the Bureau one of the "worst culprits" in its reliance on polygraph testing.
He said he had repeatedly seen highly qualified people turned away who would be excellent law enforcement officers.
The stigma follows them even if they try to apply elsewhere.
Police departments and federal agencies often weigh whether someone previously failed a polygraph, even if they have not tested the person themselves.
The first tester said the woman seemed to be lying about drug use.

The six men had motored out in the June gloom Monday morning for more than a day of fun.
They finally pulled it to the side of the boat, the Breakaway, and tied it up with a steel cable.
By the time they hauled it to Huntington Harbour and had it weighed at a processing plant in Gardena, south of Los Angeles, they realized they appeared to have broken a record for the largest mako to be caught by line, 1,323.5 pounds.
The men posed next to the cobalt blue fish and opened its jaws, revealing its dagger-sharp rows of teeth to the cameras.
They can bring it up close, take a picture and let the shark go.
David McGuire, the director of Shark Stewards, a San Francisco Bay Area nonprofit that advocates for the protection of sharks, said he was shocked.
Potter, whose nickname is "Mako Matt," doesn\'t buy any of the criticism, adding that he unloaded the shark at a public dock \u2014 not the marina.
He said that just seeing a fish weighing more than 1,000 pounds, much less catching one, was rare.
At California State University, Long Beach, marine biology professor Chris Lowe also sees a rare opportunity, particularly if the shark was pregnant, as photos of it seemed to indicate.

For Kroll, a 50-year-old entrepreneur who had plowed her life savings into the bakery, that was a critical question.
The story of how \u2014 at the end of the internship \u2014 she offered paid positions to McDonough and two other men with autism is one of luck and goodwill.
But it is also, according to Kroll, a story of a clear-eyed business decision.
Soon after, Kroll invited a group of five men with autism to help her construct and label boxes for her chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin and signature shortbread cookies.
There was a tall, blond-haired man named Zach, who loved to talk and ask questions, and Michael, who was playful and cracked jokes, and Jimmy, who was so focused that he could label boxes as fast as any worker.
Now, Drew McDonough spends his days amid the industrial-size kettles that gently simmer with 40-gallon batches of buttery toffee sauce.
Having a job, he said, "feels fabulous.
He grabs a broom and sweeps the bits of shortbread and the sprinkling of cocoa powder that had fallen here and there on the bakery floor.

Shortly after the move, Kroll heard that the men and women with autism needed job training.
Michael was playful and cracked jokes.
One day, someone at Have Dreams asked if Kroll might have other jobs for the men.
Not long after, Kroll and Have Dreams came up with a job training program at the bakery.

Alex Wong, a junior at Mark Keppel High School in Alhambra, California, is working hard for admission to an elite college.
Alex initially got shut out of all three courses he requested.
The new system caused an uproar among families whose children failed to get into AP courses, which many consider critical to develop advanced skills, boost grade-point averages and allow students to earn college credit, saving tuition dollars.
"IM DESPERATE ILL GIVE YOU FREE FOOD," one student, Kirk Hum, posted on the 210-member AP Flea Market Facebook group.
Long considered to be an elite track for the most talented and ambitious students, AP classes are now seen as beneficial for any students willing to push themselves \u2014 and schools are increasingly viewing access to them as a basic educational right.
But the College Board, which runs the AP program and is encouraging open access, said the effort has generally been successful.
Low-income students are twice as likely as others to attend schools without a full array of AP courses, according to a June study by the Education Trust and Equal Opportunity Schools.
During a recent visit, Jocz enlivened an otherwise dry lesson on Henry Clay\'s "American System" national economic plan with music clips from Bruce Springsteen and Queen, seemingly odd juxtapositions with TV characters Gumby and Pokey, and amusing factoids about the Erie Canal.
Miracle Vitangcol, a Downtown Magnets junior with average grades and test scores, is failing her AP U.S. history class; she said she is overwhelmed by the rapid pace and volume of material she needs to memorize.
But she said she intends to stick it out because the class is teaching her to manage her time, take good notes and develop perseverance.
"While expanding access is generally a good thing, we need to make sure we\'re not watering down the experience for the high achievers," said Michael Petrilli, executive vice president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a Washington-based educational policy organization.
He flagged content likely to appear on the AP exam, such as the Tariff of 1816, and directed students to work in groups on an AP-type essay question about the contributions of Thomas Jefferson.
At Jordan High School in Watts, Evan Dvorak confronted that question head-on last year when he allowed any student to take his AP physics class.
Long Beach Unified opened its AP classes a decade ago; the district has boosted the percentage of students taking the spring exams to 21 percent of its sophomores, juniors and seniors this year, from 10 percent in 2003.
At Keppel, some parents whose children were shut out of AP classes say they support the goal of open access \u2014 but not the random selection for limited spaces.
"It\'s a delicate balancing act," said Shelly Tan, whose son, Douglas, failed to get into an AP biology class after doing the summer work during a family vacation.

Cheland started attending parkour classes at Enso Movement when the North Raleigh parkour gym opened in April.
He goes to classes about twice a week, says his dad, but "he\'d go every day if he could."
"Let\'s work on nice and quiet jumps," he advised, reminding his pupils that a flat-footed landing is a loud and potentially painful landing.
Enso offers some home-schooler instruction during the day, but most classes are in the evening, typically three or four per night, each with five to 13 students.
The distinctions: Parkour \u2014 As Faircloth notes, parkour is about moving more efficiently from Point A to Point B in a safe and speedy manner.
Freerunning \u2014 Described by Enso Movement as "an expressive and aesthetic performance with roots in parkour and branches in gymnastics, martial arts, dance, and more."
Tricking \u2014 There\'s no dealing with obstacles with tricking, which, according to Faircloth, is more about "complex acrobatic moves, kicking, spins, turns," break dancing and similar moves.
"Parkour is essentially training yourself to move more efficiently from Point A to Point B effectively, safely and with speed," says 23-year-old Nick Faircloth of Raleigh, who discovered parkour when he was 16.

For eight years, Weyant has tapped, banged and stroked the fence to produce haunting, sometimes ethereal, sounds in a region he has called the "de facto militarized zone."
At one point, Weyant augmented the sound by playing a cello while wearing a zebra-head mask.
He once employed a moose call, blowing into the whistlelike contraption while standing next to the fence.
His method, like his music, was improvisational and low-tech: He inserted electronic equipment into an Altoids tin, turning it into a microphone.

Compositions can last a minute \u2014 or more than half an hour.
One day in 2005 \u2014 a time of growing concern about illegal immigration and terrorism \u2014 he decided that he wanted to hear what sounds the fence could make.
Weyant, a former professor of journalism who is now a stay-at-home dad, said he gets to the border wall as much as he can, often once a month.
He has given lectures about his music at various universities.
Another radioed his superiors: "There\'s a guy playing the wall.
"Usually," Weyant said, "when you play in a venue, you don\'t have people with guns watching you and one guy telling you that people on the other side want to hurt you."
For the most part, Border Patrol agents have left him alone.
For eight years, Weyant has tapped, banged and stroked the fence to produce haunting sounds in a region he has called practically a "militarized zone."
One day in 2005, he decided that he wanted to hear what sounds the fence could make.

The genetic sample came from a 400,000-year-old thigh bone pulled from the cold, damp depths of a Spanish cave called Sima de los Huesos, or "Pit of Bones."
Paabo and his partners published a report on their findings this past week in the journal Nature.
"Another alternative is that this ancestral group actually interbred with something much older, something like Homo erectus, and obtained its mitochondrial DNA from them," Paabo said.
At some point about 30,000 years ago, all other species of the Homo genus became extinct, leaving only us.
Answers to this mystery may emerge if the team is able to recover nuclear DNA from cells in the femur.
Cool, moist conditions within the cave, as well as rapid advancements in genetic sequencing techniques, made it easier.
Fossil remains of European Neanderthals have allowed scientists to describe their appearance in detail.
"We know quite well what Neanderthals look like.
We have their genome and we have two teeth, and those teeth are huge.
"This is positively exciting," said Andrea Manica, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Cambridge in England.
The DNA is the oldest known genetic material ever recovered from an early human.
It beats the previous record by roughly 300,000 years.
We have their genome and we have two teeth, and those teeth are huge.
The DNA is the oldest known genetic material ever recovered from an early human.
It contains far less information than DNA from a cell nucleus.

Answers to this mystery may emerge if the team is able to recover nuclear DNA from cells in the bone.
Ancient DNA information has been extremely difficult to figure out.
Older DNA samples have been obtained for other animals.
Cool, moist conditions within the cave, as well as rapid advancements in DNA technology, made it easier.
Alongside the bone were the remains of 28 other individuals.

We have their DNA, and "we have two teeth, and those teeth are huge.
Humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans all came from Homo erectus originally.
"This is positively exciting," said Andrea Manica, a scientist at the University of Cambridge in England.
About 30,000 years ago, the other groups all died off.
The DNA they decoded is the oldest material ever recovered from an early human.
It was taken from cell mitochondria.
The bone might have belonged to a group that was related to both Neanderthals and Denisovans.
Neanderthals might have gotten different mitochondrial DNA after the two groups split off.
And maybe it got its mitochondrial DNA from them.
It means that much older remains can be explored with genetics.
When some of his pigs started dying early this year, following a series of temperature swings and rains, there was little choice but to throw them out, said the farmer, who asked that only his surname, Wang, be used.
We can\'t sell them anymore \u2014 if we do, we will be punished," said Wang, 43.
The flotilla of putrid flesh was bobbing along in a major source of drinking water for Shanghai, home to more than 20 million people and a showcase city for the nation.
With financial worries never far, locals say the decision to sell dead pigs to shady brokers was not difficult, despite the fact that it could mean dangerous meat making its way to the dinner table.
But in its immediate wake, another problem formed \u2014 farmers without many resources were left with a lot of dead pigs.
Like the men standing around him in Donghui, all pig farmers, Wang had no answer for what illness, specifically, had killed his animals this year.
One farmer complained in an interview that "when there\'s disease we don\'t understand what\'s going on, and they (officials) don\'t tell us which vaccines to use."
The man, who did not want his name published, had pulled up on a black scooter in front of a small livestock dumping station next to a trash collection shed.
Yu also said that "water in the Huangpu River, where a great number of dead pigs were found, meets national standards for drinking water," according to an account by the state Xinhua newswire, which paraphrased him.
It was not clear how Pan, in detention before the floating pigs came to light, could answer with such certainty.
But the pigs-in-the-river scandal is a reminder of the distance that lies between that lofty rhetoric and the many grimmer aspects of life in China.
In Donghui, a speck on the map to the southwest of Shanghai in neighboring Zhejiang province, farmers spoke of a lack of money and information.
Officials have since pledged to expand both pickup and disposal services.

Anand Mariappan works at Microsoft in Seattle, Washington.
Mariappan and his team had to make some changes.
And, in what may be the most significant change in surgical training since the early 1900s, they are working with local medical device companies to develop new generations of software to train the next generation of medical students.
Until simulators came along about 15 years ago, the only way for surgeons to get hands-on experience was to cut into living patients under the watchful eye of a mentor.
Sweet, 44, said the idea for simulator training came to him as he was learning prostate surgery during his third year of residency at the University of Washington.
"They have more self-confidence and maybe more importantly, they learn their own limitations," said David Hananel, associate director of the medical school\'s simulation programs.
An added benefit: Simulators collect data that can be used to research surgical techniques and detect common errors.
Until simulators came along about 15 years ago, the only way for surgeons to get hands-on experience was to cut into living patients under the watchful eye of a mentor.
And we rapidly run them through tests.
You need to understand the object you\'re simulating," he said.
"We actually are trying to teach them the errors, the mistakes, the things that shouldn\'t be done.
Normally, Sweet said, first-timers last less than a minute before he has to take over.
And they are working with local medical device companies to develop new generations of software to train the next generation of medical students.
The researchers hope to build anatomical models so lifelike that medical residents will get hands-on experience and learn from their mistakes without harming patients, said Dr. Robert M. Sweet.
Until simulators came along about 15 years ago, the only way for surgeons to get hands-on experience was to cut into living patients.
Dr. Travis Pagliara, a third-year resident, said the machines are incredibly real and lifelike.
It was developed for surgeons to practice with a device that uses sound waves to liquefy brain tumors and then sucks away the debris.
It may be the most significant change in surgical training since the early 1900s.
Sweet, 44, said the idea for simulator training came to him as he was learning to do surgery.
Residents are doctors who have finished medical school and are training in hospitals to get more real-life experience.
The way in which he moves his body affects what happens on the screen.
He added that the simulator made an important difference.

Nothing is more exasperating to Brad Kramer than watching high school students take mandatory servings of fruits or vegetables in the cafeteria line, saunter past the cashier and dump them in the trash can.
Kramer and other critics of the federal standards for healthy school lunches say the rules, imposed in 2012, are too costly and restrictive, and that Congress should loosen them.
Students also ate 20 percent more vegetables and 13 percent more of their lunch entrees, according to the study.
"For Congress to meddle with doctors\' recommendations and go back to less-healthy meals now would not be in the best interest of our children," Vilsack said.

Tidal officials did not disclose financial details about how artists played on Tidal would be compensated.
Tidal describes itself as "the first music-streaming service that combines the best high-fidelity sound quality, high-definition music videos and expertly curated editorial."
The pricing will include two tiers of fees and access \u2014 with no free service.
Although the streaming service will offer original content, there are already plenty of free social media services and content portals for artists to engage with fans.
"Our goal is simple: We want to create a better service and a better experience for both fans and artists," singer Alicia Keys, one of the owners of Tidal, said at the news conference.
Tidal, which is available in 31 countries, had 500,000 paid subscribers by the end of 2014.
It has plans to expand to six additional countries.

Shortly after she launched her signature anti-obesity initiative more than three years ago, Michelle Obama signaled she would take on a contentious issue: advertising for snacks, soft drinks, sugary cereals and fast food aimed at children.
"The White House got cold feet," said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who had championed the guidelines.
But many public health advocates believe a more forceful approach is needed to limit food marketing.
"This is one of the easiest areas where we could take action and have a very powerful effect," said Dale Kunkel, a University of Arizona communications professor who studies the effect of advertising on children.
In 2009, Congress approved a Harkin-sponsored measure to set up an interagency working group to write voluntary nutrition standards for products advertised to children.
Powell suggested the working group should "be put on hold" while food companies improved the Children\'s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, a self-regulatory effort they set up in 2006.
Two days later, top food manufacturers rolled out a more rigorous version of their self-regulatory effort.
The companies pledged to follow a single nutrition standard that limits the levels of sugar, salt and fat in products targeted at children.
The group, which now includes 17 companies, gave itself until the end of this year to make the changes.
It also does not limit appeals in sponsorships of after-school events or on product packages, as the working group guidelines had proposed.

The group proposed that its standards apply to all ads aimed at children 17 and younger.
Shortly after she launched her signature anti-obesity initiative more than three years ago, Michelle Obama signaled she would take on a contentious issue: advertising for snacks, soft drinks, sugary cereals and fast food aimed at children.
She bluntly told executives "to step it up" to improve the foods they market to children.

Shortly after she launched her anti-obesity campaign more than three years ago, Michelle Obama signaled she would take on advertising for snacks, soft drinks, sugary cereals and fast food aimed at children.
But when food and media companies fought against the guidelines in 2011, the first lady went silent.
And she has avoided public fights that could pit her against the companies.
Administration officials say she has notched some notable successes.
A report by the prestigious Institute of Medicine found in 2005 that television advertising influenced children to seek out unhealthy foods.
"This is one of the easiest areas where we could take action and have a very powerful effect," said Dale Kunkel, who studies the effect of advertising on children.

Powell suggested the group should "be put on hold" while food companies improved the Children\'s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, which was set up in 2006.
Still, the group released draft guidelines in April 2011.
Public health groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics embraced the guidelines.
Two days later, top food makers rolled out a more rigorous version of their own effort.
A study by Yale University found that half the food and drink ads seen by children in 2011 were not covered by the pledge because they aired on shows, such as "Family Guy," that are seen by both children and adults.

Two days later, top food makers rolled out a tougher version of their own effort.
More than three years ago Michelle Obama launched an anti-obesity campaign.
Nickelodeon aired a quarter of the food ads viewed by children ages 2 to 11 in 2011, according to a study.
Four Democratic senators recently asked that Nickelodeon set stricter nutrition standards for the products it advertises, but the network declined the request.
Snacks, soft drinks, sugary cereals and fast food have been blamed for making many American children overweight, or even obese.
Still, the government group came up with rules in April 2011.
They promised to limit the levels of sugar, salt and fat in products targeted at children.

What began as a modest idea to collect and donate stray pencils mushroomed into a campaign that has pulled in thousands of writing implements \u2014 some used but most new \u2014 from local schools, businesses and churches.
"Children giving to children is really valuable," Oppenheimer said, praising Kyle\'s ability not only to appeal to his peers but to motivate students in lower grades to be part of the project.
The idea behind her one-person organization is simple: People who learn about her mission from her website mail in or hand-deliver pencils.
She packs them, fitting around 200 pencils in sealed bags, then hands the packages to travelers heading for developing countries, who pack them into their suitcases.
She said she came up with the idea when she traveled as a volunteer with a medical mission to Peru in 2005.
She had taken a suitcase of clothing to donate but soon realized that people wanted her pen.
Kyle reached out last summer and "was super interested and energetic from the very beginning," Oppenheimer said.
Since he started his drives, the donations have been pouring in: more than 3,500 pencils collected from local businesses, churches and schools.
Throughout February, students dropped pencils and markers into shoeboxes outside classrooms and the cafeteria.
Kyle took them home and said he planned to pack them in the sealed bags and deliver to Oppenheimer to coordinate the delivery.
Christopher Bacchioni, a fifth-grader, said he donated "to give pencils to people who don\'t have utensils, to help people in need."

TAWA, Canada \u2013 One-quarter of all the food in the world is lost each year, owing to inefficient harvesting, inadequate storage and wastage in the kitchen.
The extent of food loss is particularly galling in view of a new global study on food security from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO).
Of course, there has also been remarkable progress: over the last 25 years, the world has fed an extra 2 billion people, and \u2013 for all the 57 failures \u2013 the developing world as a whole has almost halved its hunger rate.
These targets are vitally important, because they will determine how more than $2.5 trillion in development money is spent on everything from climate change to malaria.
My think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus Center, therefore asked 60 teams of top economists to assess which proposed targets will do the most good \u2013 and which will not.
Our research on food security shows that there are smart ways to feed many more on the planet \u2013 but they have little to do with the campaigns against waste seen in most of the rich world.
In Britain, for example, the greatest waste is in salads, vegetables and fruits \u2013 luxuries when compared with the cheap calories contained in the grains and tubers consumed throughout the developing world.
By 2050, better infrastructure could mean that 57 million people \u2013 more than the current population of South Africa \u2013 would no longer be at risk of hunger, and that about 4 million children would no longer suffer from malnutrition.
TAWA, Canada \u2013 One-quarter of all the food in the world is lost each year, owing to inefficient harvesting, inadequate storage and wastage in the kitchen.
There are many remedies for this kind of waste \u2013 from the "curing" of roots and tubers to minimize damage, to more expensive refrigeration.
We can achieve three times the economic benefits, and even larger reductions in the number of people at risk of hunger, if we focus on improving food production rather than just on preventing food losses.
Investing an extra $88 billion in agricultural research and development over the next 15 years would increase yields by an additional 0.4 percent each year.
But we could take an enormous step toward winning the global campaign against malnutrition, simply by investing in improved infrastructure and in agricultural research and development.

TAWA, Canada \u2013 One-quarter of all the food in the world is lost each year due to inefficient harvesting, inadequate storage and waste in the kitchen.
One reason is that by then the world will have added another 2 billion mouths to feed; a second reason will be the growing appetite of a surging new middle class, as economies grow and people have more money to spend on food.
At the moment, the United Natiions is considering 169 new development targets to succeed the Millennium Development Goals.
The issues range from climate change to malaria.
By 2050, better infrastructure could mean that 57 million people \u2013 more than the current population of South Africa \u2013 would no longer be at risk of hunger.
Today, only $5 billion is spent annually on research to improve the seven major global food crops, and just one-tenth of that is targeted to help small farmers in Africa and Asia.

If that waste is cut in half, the world could feed an extra billion people \u2013 and make hunger a problem of the past.
Improving roads and railroads also allows fertilizer and other agricultural supplies to reach farmers.

Many people think food waste just happens in the kitchen.
In poor countries, however, people waste very little.
Research can help fight disease in certain crops.
Search and rescue teams looking of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane have found no signs of the airliner \u2013 only garbage.
For the first time since the search focused on the southern Indian Ocean 10 days ago, the skies were clear and the sea was calm.
The good weather has allowed ships working off the west coast of Australia to retrieve the "suspicious items" spotted by planes and on satellite pictures.
They were just the ordinary garbage that swirls around the ocean.
The disappointing results demonstrated the difficulty of trying to find out what happened to the Boeing 777.
Australian authorities said Sunday that a naval support ship, the Ocean Shield, will depart from Perth on Monday with a "black box detector" supplied by the U.S. Navy.
The odds are stacked against finding it in time without a trail of debris to guide them.
But the area accumulates a surprisingly large amount of garbage, trapped in the spiral of slowly rotating currents.
The lack of debris has prevented families from achieving any kind of closure over the deaths of their relatives.
"We want evidence, truth and dignity," read banners that Chinese relatives held at a demonstration at a Kuala Lumpur hotel on Sunday.

Malaysia Airlines said Sunday that it will fly families of passengers to Perth.
But none of the objects off the west coast of Australia turned out to be pieces of the missing plane.
The objects were identified as fishing equipment and other garbage.
But they show how hard it is to discover what happened to the airplane.

Tracy Peasant began crying on the witness stand in federal court Monday morning as she testified about buying bottled water for herself and eight children \u2014 four of whom are her grandchildren \u2014 because water service at her home was cut off due to a delinquent bill of more than $8,500.
The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) never told her she could request a hearing to dispute the bill, Peasant testified.
Peasant said her service was unexpectedly restored in June by a woman she believed to be a DWSD worker.
Rhodes focused on this discrepancy and asked McCormick if it was legal to cut off service to delinquent customers without complying with rules on the website.
The advocacy groups include the National Action Network, Michigan Welfare Rights Organization, Moratorium Now and the Peoples Water Board.
"The city has a responsibility to all of its residents," Mithani said in her opening statement.
This is wrong,\'" Peasant testified.
The advocacy groups called water director Sue McCormick to testify about the shut-off policy.
McCormick said the department stopped notifying customers face-to-face, but she was unsure exactly when the policy changed.

The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) never told her she could request a hearing to challenge the bill, Peasant testified.
The old rules, written in 2003, call for a Water Department worker to identify himself or herself to the customer and show the past due account.
The judge focused on this difference between the rule and what actually happened.
She could not answer a series of questions, though, about how many of those homes had children living there or people with medical problems or disabilities.

The bankruptcy will allow Detroit to sell off some of its property to raise money to cover its bills.
Peasant was turned down for special funds that would help her pay the bill because she owed too much.
The nonprofit groups include the National Action Network, Michigan Welfare Rights Organization, Moratorium Now and the Peoples Water Board.
However, lawyers for the city said Detroit cannot simply give away water.
Attorney Sonal Mithani said stopping the shut-offs would only hurt customers who have not paid their water bills, because their bills would pile up.
She could not say how many of the homes had children living in them or people with medical problems or disabilities.
She testified she makes $190,000 a year \u2014 about 63 times more than Peasant makes.

Everett Middle School Principal Lena Van Haren announced the winners on Monday, more than a week after the results were known.
She said in a phone interview that she had no intention of annulling the votes, but wanted to first engage all the candidates in a discussion about how to ensure underrepresented groups were heard.
The school of about 500 sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders is 56 percent Hispanic or Latino and 9 percent African-American, according to data on the California Department of Education website.
"This is complex, but as a parent and a principal, I truly believe it behooves us to be thoughtful about our next steps here so that we can have a diverse student council that is truly representative of all voices at Everett," she wrote.
Melissa Daar Carvajal, whose twin sons are sixth-graders at Everett, said Van Haren may have been wrong to delay announcing the election results, but her goal of making it a lesson about ensuring all people are represented was right.
David said the principal undermined the democratic process in the name of social justice.
She said that the aim was to have a diverse student council "that is truly representative of all voices at Everett."
The principal at a mostly Hispanic middle school in San Francisco, California, delayed the results of a student government election.
The argument started with an email Van Haren sent to parents.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ordered the National Guard to Ferguson early Monday, hours after police used tear gas to clear protesters off the streets following a week of demonstrations against the fatal police shooting of a black Missouri teenager.
A preliminary private autopsy found the unarmed teen was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.
As night fell in Ferguson, another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated after marchers pushed toward one end of a street and authorities \u2014 who said they were responding to reports of gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails \u2014 pushed them back by repeatedly firing tear gas.
A federally conducted autopsy "more closely focused on entry point of projectiles, defensive wounds and bruises" might help the Justice Department\'s investigation, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the criminal civil rights section of the U.S. attorney\'s office in Miami.
Federal authorities also want to calm any public fears that no action will be taken on the case, Weinstein said.
Officers in riot gear ordered all protesters to disperse.
Many of the marchers retreated, but a group of about 100 stood defiantly about two blocks away until getting hit by another volley of tear gas.
Protesters laid a line of cinder blocks across the street near the QuikTrip convenience store that was burned down last week.
Someone set a nearby trash bin on fire, and the crackle of gunfire could be heard from several blocks away.
Johnson added: "We all need to thank the Browns for Michael.
Police have said little about the encounter between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot.
Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple rounds.
The officer who shot Brown has been identified as Darren Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him.
Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting, and the department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts.
Others in the group, composed mostly of police and relatives of officers, carried signs urging people to wait for all the facts in the shooting case before making up their minds.

In 2012, Australia stopped tobacco companies using brand logos, colors or promotional text on their packaging.
Tobacco companies said they would challenge the U.K. law, scheduled to come into effect next year.
"Customers identify with brands, so companies are understandably uneasy at the prospect of a key part of their identity being undermined."
Now, cigarettes sold in Ireland will come in olive green packets dominated by images of damaged lungs.
"I have a message for the tobacco industry," said James Reilly, the Irish government minister behind the new law.

"The idea of cutting out American books because they are not British is crazy," said John Carey, a literary critic and emeritus professor at Oxford University.
Gone, too, are African and Asian writers including Haruki Murakami, Chinua Achebe and Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche.
It also says pupils are required to study "seminal world literature" \u2014 including American classics \u2014 between the ages of 11 and 14.
The new book lists include a wide sample of modern British literature and drama, from George Orwell\'s "Animal Farm" and William Golding\'s "Lord of the Flies" to Kazuo Ishiguro\'s novel "Never Let Me Go," Alan Bennett\'s play "The History Boys" and "Anita and Me," a coming-of-age novel by comedian and author Meera Syal.
The 19th-century novels on offer include Dickens\' "Great Expectations," Jane Austen\'s "Pride and Prejudice" and Mary Shelley\'s "Frankenstein."
But debate on the changes has focused on the loss of "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Of Mice and Men," which several generations of Britons remember \u2014 mostly fondly \u2014 from their school days.
Times newspaper columnist Janice Turner welcomed the removal of Steinbeck\'s book, which she said was studied for all the wrong reasons \u2014 "because it is short, simple and has a didactic \'message\': bullying is bad."

But he regretted the loss of the two American books.
British teenagers won\'t be studying "To Kill A Mockingbird" and other American literature for a major high school exam anymore.
The previous rules also said students must study authors from different countries.
And reading "To Kill A Mockingbird, he said, can change the way you think.
Like the real war, this make-believe war has its casualties.
So far in Afghanistan, the problem of mistaking a toy gun for a real one has not been significant.
The noise of real gunfire is almost unmistakable to most Afghans.
The toy guns come mostly from China and the neighboring country of Pakistan.
Many were given to young boys as gifts during the recent Eid, or festival, which marks the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
"An awareness video was prepared ... to inform people how much these toy guns can be dangerous," said Dr. Abdul Rahim Majeed, the program manager for the public Noor Eye Hospital.
"Unfortunately, the families did not take it seriously and didn\'t pay attention to this important message and it caused many people to get injured and come to hospitals for treatments."
Parents like Shakib Nasery, a 38-year-old father of two, welcomed the effort to destroy the toy guns.
After many long years of war, weapons can be seen almost everywhere in Afghanistan.
Nearly all those injured were children.
Before the holiday started, authorities tried to warn parents about the dangers of toy guns.
A video was prepared "to inform people how much these toy guns can be dangerous," said Dr. Abdul Rahim Majeed of the Noor Eye Hospital.
Majeed said many of those injured by toy guns came to Noor.
Majeed said the number of people injured nationwide was probably higher than reported.

McClintock, whose district includes Yosemite, pushed for public access and recreational use, citing bicycling, horseback riding and ice skating as examples.

Investors and entrepreneurs are putting their money and technology talents into farming and they have an ambitious agenda: to make sure there is enough food for the 10 billion people expected to inhabit the planet by 2100, do it without destroying the world \u2014 and make a load of cash along the way.
Silicon Valley is pushing its way into every stage of the food-growing process.
They have designed robots to trim lettuce and software to calculate grass production for cattle grazing.

The White House said that Rousseff and President Barack Obama had agreed it would be better to have the visit later.
Obama "understands and regrets" the concern that reports about U.S. spying has caused in Brazil, the White House said.
There have been three news reports in Brazil based on classified papers since July.
The NSA also spied on other top officials, the report said.
They did not want it to be overshadowed by one issue between the countries, "no matter how important or challenging the issue may be," the White House said.
He canceled a planned meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month.
Putin let Snowden stay in Russia temporarily.
But the two leaders met informally during a meeting of top countries later in St. Petersburg.
It was supposed to big for  Brazil.
But Rousseff appears to have decided that scolding Washington over spying was more important for her audience at home than a sit-down in the Oval Office.
"Slapping Obama in the face, standing up to the big neighbor in the North" could make her more popular as she faces next year\'s elections, said David Fleischer of the University of Brasilia.
In a remote part of southwestern Palm Beach County, as a platoon of reporters and photographers watched, a Florida panther was lowered to the ground in a crate.
Such a fate is common for male panthers rescued and released by state wildlife officers.
All eight males are dead, three killed by other panthers, one by a vehicle, two by disease and two by unknown causes.
"Every panther life is important at this point because you\'re dealing with one of the most critically [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) in the United States," said Jennifer Hecker, director of natural resource policy for the Conservancy of Southwest Florida.
But many people who live or hunt around panther habitat oppose any program that adds more of the cats to land already saturated with them.
Last week, the wildlife agency captured and relocated a young male found by a Collier County beach.
It\'s cruel to the cats, and it\'s dangerous to people."
The work going into rescuing panthers can be highly elaborate.
Orphaned panthers are taken to the White Oak Conservation Center near Jacksonville where they grow up with minimal human contact and learn to hunt on their own.
Although some veterinary services are donated, the state pays most of the bills, relying on sales of Protect the Panther license plates.
When discovered near death, he was found with scars on his face, evidence of surviving fights with other panthers.
"The fact that he had been in a fight and survived indicates that he was "man enough" to stand up to other panthers and walk away wiser to panther hierarchy and protocols which would serve him well later in life," Lotz said.

These population declines have implications far beyond a sustainable supply of fish that consumers like to eat.
Predators keep prey populations in balance, and the loss of predators can cause trophic (nutritional) cascades through food webs that affect entire ocean ecosystems.
Fishing quotas for many species need to be reduced and existing quotas need to be enforced to ensure that we have healthy populations of these fish\u2014and healthy oceans\u2014in the future.
Many of these predatory fish species are known to be in trouble.
The removal of top predators has been called "humankind\'s most pervasive influence on nature," and it is as detrimental in the sea as it is on land.
Fishing quotas for many species need to be reduced and existing quotas need to be enforced to ensure that we have healthy populations of these fish\u2014and healthy oceans\u2014in the future.
Top predators are large animals, such as lions and great white sharks, that hunt smaller animals, but have no natural predators of their own \u2014 except humans.
This keeps ocean life in balance.
For example, kelp-eating sea urchins have been growing in number due to the loss of urchin predators like sea otters.
Thirty-four fish stocks \u2014 local populations of fish of the same species \u2014 have been declared rebuilt since the year 2000 and more than 90 percent of U.S. fish stocks are not considered overfished.

Top predators are large animals, such as lions and great white sharks, that hunt smaller animals, but have no natural predators of their own \u2014 except humans.
An ocean food chain starts with many microscopic organisms and plant life.
Scientists analyzed food webs involving more than 3,000 ocean species.
Their results show that since the beginning of the 20th century, humans have reduced predatory fish populations by more than two-thirds.
Most of this alarming decline has occurred since the 1970s.
The result has been the destruction of kelp forests, which are home to many unique and economically important species.

It\'s a story from before Werner Klemke was deeply beloved for his drawings of the "Grimm\'s Fairy Tales," which made their way to every East German child\'s bookshelf, and his hundreds of often lightheartedly erotic magazine covers, which were eagerly snapped up upon publication.
It surfaced only when Dutch documentary filmmaker Annet Betsalel asked whether she could poke around in the long-shuttered archives of the Jewish community of Bussum, the Netherlands.
What she found was the story of a network set up by a Jewish businessman, Sam van Perlstein, who knew in 1942 that Jews were living on borrowed time under Nazi occupation and that if they were going to survive they were going to need help.
It began once upon a time, in a city called Amsterdam, in a magical bookstore called Erasmus, famed for carrying books filled with thoughts and words the Nazis feared.
They allowed van Perlstein to reclaim the import business and money that had been frozen.
That money went to fund resistance to the Nazis, and a hideaway network.
Klemke, who later in life was known for perfectionism in printing down to the choices of paper, typefaces and inks for the books in which his work was published, made up a cover story to hide his work from his Nazi superiors.
He told them that he could make nice booklets of cocktail recipes for them if he could only get a small graphics office set up.
Once this was provided, he made the cocktail books \u2014 but he also produced fake birth certificates, food ration coupons, baptismal records and even ID cards.
As Betsalel noted, the notion of Jews hidden in the Netherlands is hardly news.
The hiding places built into walls and attics and cellars in the village were not discovered, and today are used as storage rooms, she noted.
And yet Klemke, whose artwork made him a consummate storyteller, never talked about that stage of his life, not in dozens of interviews or speeches.
It had long been known that Klemke had been a Wehrmacht soldier during World War II, stationed in the Netherlands to uphold the Nazi occupation of that nation.
On his deathbed, Klemke told his children they could find "important documents on the third shelf" in his office.
"Many a German kept silent about their S.S. membership," it wrote, referring to the infamous Nazi troops.

He did this work despite knowing that had his superiors, or any unfriendly person, discovered what he was doing, he almost certainly would have been executed.
And over the next few years, he produced documents that helped some people escape from the country, and allowed others to survive while they remained in hiding.
In all, the network saved an estimated 500 Jews.
Others, including members of the underground and British pilots, also were saved.
Whatever the motivation, the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung recently noted the irony in this aspect of the story.
"Many a German kept silent about their S.S. membership," it wrote, referring to the infamous Nazi troops.
One day, a love of books brought a young German soldier named Johannes Gerhardt into the store.
He was so enchanted by the books that when he left the store, he forgot his rifle.

President Barack Obama has called for $75 million in new federal spending to help pay for 50,000 police body cameras for local police departments.
In many instances, he said, lawmakers are focused on how long departments should have to keep video, and if or when recordings should be made public.
In Clearfield, Utah, a city of about 30,000 located 30 miles north of Salt Lake City, the police department has been using body cameras since 2010.
As the nationwide push intensifies for police to wear body cameras, states and cities have encountered one consistent roadblock to adopting the technology: the cost.
In the wake of many high-profile cases between officers and the public, police departments across the country are feeling pressure to equip officers with body cameras.

Investigators looking for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have put away their towed pinger locator and are about to call off searches for surface debris.
"It is time to go underwater," Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who is coordinating the search from Perth, Australia, said in announcing the new phase of operations.
"The whole key on these searches is you have to be methodical and persistent, and they can take quite a bit of time," said David Kelly, president and chief executive of Bluefin Robotics, the Quincy, Massachusette, company that makes the vessel.
If something noteworthy is detected, Kelly said, the sonar can be swapped out for high-definition cameras.
While the robotic sub does its duties, search personnel aboard the Ocean Shield and other vessels will have no idea whether it has found anything.
"It doesn\'t transfer any imagery or anything while it\'s down there."
The decision to deploy the Bluefin-21 came on day 38 of the search for the plane, which vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing.
On four occasions, starting April 5, a pinger locator towed by the Ocean Shield picked up transmissions from what investigators strongly suspect were one or both of the black boxes.
But with no new transmissions in the last six days, investigators have apparently concluded that the batteries on those devices \u2014 which are supposed to last 30 days \u2014 have run out.
Meanwhile, Houston indicated that the so-far unsuccessful search for debris on the ocean surface \u2014 with lookouts scanning the waters from the air and from ships \u2014 would probably be called off in the next two to three days.

They planned to send it 2.8 miles underwater down to the seabed and use its side-scanning sonar arrays to look for wreckage from the plane.
"It is time to go underwater," Australian Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said, announcing the new phase of operations.
He is president and chief executive of Bluefin Robotics, the Quincy, Massachusette, company that makes the vessel.
The depth at which the Bluefin-21 will work \u2014 2.8 miles \u2014 is hard even for oceanographers to fathom.
The decision to deploy the Bluefin-21 came on day 38 of the search for the plane.
Searchers operating more than 1,300 miles off the western coast of Australia had waited to deploy the sub.
But there have been no new transmissions in the last six days.
"It sounds like Angus Houston said some words to prepare everybody that they\'re going to, in a couple days, shut down all the air and surface search operations," he added.

"It is time to go underwater," Australian Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said, announcing the new phase of operations.
The Bluefin-21 operates on a 24-hour cycle.
When the cameras are being used, the sub hovers just 15 feet off the seafloor.
It\'s a "tough call to make," said Van Gurley, a retired U.S. Navy captain and senior manager at Metron Inc. Metron helped locate the wreckage of Air France Flight 447 after it crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.

Unless the robot submarine gets lucky, the process could take a while.
He is president of Bluefin Robotics, the Massachusetts company that makes the vessel.
But the Bluefin-21 uses sonar to gather information that will make a high-resolution 3-D map.
It tells scientists basic information such as depth and power remaining.
Investigators strongly suspect they were from one or both of the black boxes.
"The chances of any floating material being recovered" have fallen dramatically, Houston said.

The 16-foot, 1,650-pound sub moves about as fast as a person walking.
These searches "can take quite a bit of time" said David Kelly.
It can search underwater for 16 hours.
Once it gets back to the surface, it takes four hours to download the information it gathered.
It floats in pitch-black water about 150 feet off the sea floor.

At room temperature, hydrogen is normally a gas.
The "Paris agreement" aims to keep global temperatures from rising another degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) between now and 2100, a key demand of poor countries ravaged by rising sea levels and other effects of climate change.
Some delegates wept, others embraced.
In the pact, the countries pledge to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100.
In practical terms, achieving that goal means the world would have to stop emitting greenhouse gases \u2014 most of which come from the burning of oil, coal and gas for energy \u2014 altogether in the next half-century, scientists said.
Speaking from Washington, President Barack Obama said the climate agreement offers "the best chance to save the one planet we have."
The deal commits countries to keeping the rise in global temperatures by the year 2100 compared with pre-industrial times "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and says they will "endeavor to limit" them even more, to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
People held hands beneath the Eiffel Tower and stretched a two-kilometer-long (1.2-mile-long) banner from the Arc de Triomphe to the business district La Defense.
Some scientists who had criticized earlier drafts as unrealistic praised the final pact for including language that essentially means the world will have to all but stop polluting with greenhouse gases by 2070 to reach the 2-degree goal, or by 2050 to reach the 1.5-degree goal.
In addition to the cuts in emissions, the goal could be reached in part by increasing how much carbon dioxide is sucked out of the air by planting forests or with futuristic technology, Oppenheimer said, but added such technology would be expensive.
Brazilian Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira added: "Today, we\'ve proven that it\'s possible for every country to come together, hand in hand, to do its part to fight climate change."
More than 180 countries have already presented plans to limit greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 a breakthrough in itself after years of stalemate.
Speaking from Washington, President Barack Obama said the climate agreement offers "the best chance to save the one planet we have."
Nearly 200 nations adopted the first global pact to fight climate change on Saturday.
The deal is the first pact to ask all countries to join the fight against global warming.
The deal commits countries to keeping the rise in global temperatures by the year 2100 "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit),\xa0compared with pre-industrial times.
It says countries will "endeavor to limit" them even more, to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Scientist Ben Strauss, a sea level researcher, said limiting warming to 1.5 degrees instead of 2 degrees would make a significant difference.
It could potentially cut in half the projected 280 million people whose houses will eventually be submerged by rising seas.

Jewish practice calls for the first candle of eight-day Hanukkah to be lit the night before Thanksgiving Day this year, so technically Thanksgivukkah falls on the "second candle" night.
While the whole thing is lots of fun, is there anything truly cosmic happening here?
Mom-of-two Dana Gitell, who lives outside Boston, partnered with an artist and the Jewish gift site Moderntribe to create and sell souvenir T-shirts, cards and a poster.
It\'s just a day when Jews and the rest of America are celebrating on the same day," she said.
"It\'s an opportunity for us to really celebrate the Jewish American experience, and to give thanks in America for the religious freedom we enjoy here, and for making the Jewish American experience possible."
The creators nabbed the trademark to "Thanksgivukkah."

Now artists create them on a computer.
Last year, Henderson invited a fellow physicist, Alejandro Garcia, to give a lecture titled "Bubble Science."
"I wanted to use my background in computational physics, but I wanted to have the experience of working with people and being able to see the results of what I did."
"What astonished me was how much detail and motion there was in every frame, the motion of the trees, the grass and all the other elements," he said.
Then there is the technical challenge of creating something visually unique for each film: for example, the frost in "Rise of the Guardians," the cannon fire in "Kung Fu Panda 2" or the ice-breathing dragon in "How to Train Your Dragon 2."
"Doing something where you can clearly see the results of your work, and where you feel you are providing a unique benefit to the artists \u2014 that\'s what keeps me coming here every day," he said.

When she was 4, Doris Pilkington Garimara was taken from her home by the Australian government by force and sent to a lonely settlement.
Decades passed before she learned the full story.
At the camp there were bars on the windows, locks on the doors and buckets for toilets.
Chased by trackers, they headed toward a fence built in the early 1900s to protect farmland from rabbits.
But because the government did not record aboriginal births, her exact birth date is unknown.
Pilkington Garimara later said she grew up thinking, "my mother didn\'t want me and gave me away."
Forget climbing Mount Everest \u2014 for most humans, just eking out a living on the harsh Tibetan plateau is challenge enough.
The study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, identifies a long segment of DNA shared by the extinct people known as Denisovans and modern-day Tibetans.
In the new study, scientists collected blood samples from 40 Tibetans and sequenced more than 30,000 nucleotides on a segment of DNA containing EPAS1, the gene that makes Tibetans so well-suited for life at high altitude.
"Natural selection by itself could not explain that pattern," said Rasmus Nielsen, a computational biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and an author of the study.
The scientists used computer models to test two different hypotheses.
The reason Tibetans need EPAS1 is that their mountainous home \u2014 a crease of buckled crust thrust upward by the tectonic collision of India and Asia \u2014 lies about 15,000 feet above sea level, on average.
They know only that it leads to lower levels of hemoglobin \u2014 the oxygen-toting protein in blood \u2014 in Tibetans who live at high altitude compared with people from low elevations who have acclimatized.
But people without the gene tend "overreact" at altitude.
There are very negative fitness effects of having too many red blood cells, and the Tibetans avoid them."
Abigail Bigham, an anthropologist at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the study, said now the search for Denisovan DNA should extend to other groups not represented in the Human Genome Diversity Panel.
No one knew the Denisovans ever roamed the Earth until four years ago, when scientists sequenced the DNA of a finger bone unearthed in a cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia.
Like Neanderthals, Denisovans mated with their human contemporaries, scientists soon discovered.
So they investigated whether the gene might have been imported from extinct Neanderthals or Denisovans, and, bingo, they found a match.
Alternatively, the gene could have entered the Tibetan gene pool more recently via sex.
Now they realize that these species are responsible for introducing some of the genetic diversity that allowed people to adapt to unique environments.
"Not only has there been interbreeding, but in fact that interbreeding has led to important functional changes in the human genome."
Forget climbing Mount Everest \u2014 for most humans, just eking out a living on the harsh Tibetan plateau is challenge enough.
Now it appears that Tibetans can also trace part of their ancestry to this mysterious group.
They found the high-altitude gene in only two of the 40 Han Chinese people in the panel and no one else.
Were Denisovans and Tibetans descended from a common ancestor that gave the gene to both?
Or did humans acquire the gene by mating with Denisovans?
So they investigated whether the gene might have been imported from extinct Neanderthals or Denisovans \u2014 and, bingo, they found a match.
Forget climbing Mount Everest \u2014 for most humans, surviving on the harsh Tibetan plateau would be challenge enough.
The reason Tibetans need EPAS1 is that their mountainous home lies about 15,000 feet above sea level, on average.
The reason Tibetans need EPAS1 is that their mountainous home lies about 15,000 feet above sea level, on average.
It is that gene, scientists think, that gives Tibetans an advantage over lowlanders at high altitudes.
In the new study, which was published on Wednesday, scientists collected blood samples from 40 Tibetans.
Early humans and Denisovans probably separated around half a million years ago.
Once transferred, the gene would have spread rapidly in the Tibetan population.
That relative, the Denisovan people, died out \u2014 they became extinct \u2014 tens of thousands of years ago.
Having certain genes can put someone at risk for diseases.
The scientists then studied blood samples from 1,000 non-Tibetans.
Tibet and China border each other, and China governs Tibet.
There was still an unanswered question, though: Just how did EPAS1 end up in modern Tibetans?
The reason Tibetans need EPAS1 is simple: Their mountainous home lies about 15,000 feet above sea level, on average.
Now they also know where it came from.
The bodies of people without EPAS1 \u2014 pretty much everybody but Tibetans \u2014 react to the low level of oxygen by producing a lot of red blood cells.
Now there is a new study that makes the case that the island is sinking, just very, very slowly.
Further research is needed to better understand how big the tsunami would be, Castillo said.
Castillo estimates Catalina is sinking an average of 1 millimeter \u2014 around 4 one-hundredths of an inch \u2014 every five years.
A study published in 2012 reported what the authors said was strong evidence that the island was rising up like many other places in Southern California.
So far, no one has been able to produce indisputable evidence of either rising or sinking, Schumann said.
For decades, scientists have debated whether Santa Catalina Island is sinking or rising.
Santa Catalina Island is located off the coast of California.
It was just another average Friday morning in Chelyabinsk, Russia, when suddenly a fireball brighter than the sun streaked across the sky.
Residents were still confused by the giant firework they had just witnessed when minutes later there was a huge explosion in the air.
Small fragments from the asteroid have been found on the ground all around the region.
White House science adviser John Holdren explained: "An asteroid of that size, or bigger, could plausibly end civilization."
These asteroids are nicknamed "city killers."

Many experts have looked into many ways of making sure an asteroid does not hit our planet.
Some scientists have even suggested attaching huge weights to the asteroid to change its direction away from Earth.
Still, using any of these methods requires lots of advance warning.

A few weeks ago, a man who was running from the police fled through the corn to hide in her yard, she says.
Up until last summer, she felt like she lived in a city.
Family Roots planted vegetables in the once empty land.
It wants to find ways to grow good crops like corn an other vegetables in ground that might not be so healthy.
But what Family Roots wants to do and what some of the people who live in the neighborhood want is very different.

A federal trademark board ruled Wednesday that the Washington Redskins nickname is "disparaging of [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American)" and that the team\'s trademark protections should be canceled, a decision that applies new financial and political pressure on the team to change its name.
The 2-1 ruling from the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board came in a case that has been working its way through legal channels for more than two decades.
If it stands, it would mean the team can continue to use the name, but it would lose a significant portion of its ability to protect the financial interests connected to it.
"Our job as players is to focus on what we can on this field day-in and day-out and let the legal people take care of that stuff," quarterback Robert Griffin III said after practice.
"Daniel Snyder may be the last person in the world to realize this," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor, "but it is just a matter of time until he is forced to do the right thing."

The Redskins quickly announced that they will appeal, and the cancellation for trademark protections will be on hold while the matter makes its way through the courts.
"We\'ve seen this story before," Redskins attorney Bob Raskopf said.
Redskins players have mostly avoided the topic, aware of a potential conflict because they are employed by the team.

The Redskins quickly announced that they will appeal, or argue that the ruling was unjust, and the ending of trademark protections will be on hold while the matter makes its way through the courts.
If others printed the name on sweatshirts or other clothing without permission, it would become more difficult to go after them.
Suzan Shown Harjo, a lead figure in the trademark case, said the foundation was simply trying to sway public opinion.

In a paper last month in the journal Nature, an international team of scientists sought to sort out this issue for a particular group of meteorites known as shergottites.
To settle the question, researchers led by Desmond Moser of Western University in Ontario, Canada, examined a meteorite known as Northwest Africa 5298.
They looked at very tiny deposits within it known as baddeleyites \u2014 tough, zirconium-rich minerals that are "10 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair," said study co-author Axel Schmitt, a geochemist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
By looking at the isotopic ratios of radioactive uranium and lead in this tough rock, the scientists found that it formed about 187 million years ago (give or take 33 million).
The scientists could also see evidence of the damage done to the meteorite by the event that may have released it from the Martian surface about 22 million years ago (give or take 2 million).
The shock from that impact muddled up the mineral structure inside, while keeping the chemicals themselves mostly intact \u2014 like shaking up a sealed gift box of chocolates.
Until then, they have to settle for examining meteorites \u2014 chunks of the Red Planet that land on Earth after hurtling through space and surviving the searing fall through our atmosphere.
By looking at the isotopic ratios of radioactive uranium and lead in this tough rock, the scientists found that it formed about 187 million years ago (give or take 33 million).
"If they had found that it was 4 billion years old, I would eat my hat," he said.
Planetary scientists dream of sending a geologist to Mars to study its rocks by hand.
This confirmed that the baddeleyites were young.
In a paper last month in the journal Nature, an international team of scientists sought to sort this out for a particular group of meteorites known as shergottites.

The deadly collapse of a garment factory in Bangladesh has forced retailers and lawmakers to take a long, hard look at the human cost of cheap clothes.
The eight-story Rana Plaza factory complex crumbled on April 24 with nearly 3,000 workers trapped inside, killing more than 1,100.
Another worker, Sonia Akthar, was sewing a "stripy, long-sleeved T-shirt" when the ceiling collapsed on her, Al-Jazeera reported.
Her leg became trapped under heavy concrete, and rescuers were forced to pull her away from her own limb to save her.
When a doctor refused to go into the wrecked building, 30-year-old worker Didar Hossein went in on his own.
Nineteen-year-old Reshma Begum survived for 17 days trapped in the wreckage with nothing but a little water and four packets of cookies.
The property owner, Mohammed Sohel Rana, was arrested trying to flee the country.
He is a local politician, but was also well known as a "mastan" or neighborhood gangster.
On Tuesday, survivors of the collapse brought traffic to a standstill as they protested near the factory site.
The factory industry has provided many much-needed job opportunities, especially for women.
Western companies were attracted to Bangladesh for its low wages and fast production.
But the cheap cost and quick turnaround comes at a human cost: factories commonly employed underage workers, and forced pregnant women to work until just before their due dates.
Target, Gap and J.C. Penney met with workers rights groups last week to discuss how to improve safety conditions.
But some are skeptical that the Western brands will make a difference, since they are the ones demanding quick, cheap production from the factories.
"How can a garment businessman keep up with this ever-increasing demand?
"I am troubled by the deafening silence from other apparel retailers on this issue," said Galen Weston, the chairman of Loblaw, a Canadian apparel brand that used the Rana Plaza factory to manufacture its goods.
Rumors are flying that the construction workers who built the factory used second-rate materials and cut safety corners because they knew Rana would not pay for them.
However, with hundreds of bodies still being pulled from the rubble, the Bangladeshi workers themselves could provide the strongest force for change.
The deadly collapse of a garment factory in Bangladesh has forced retailers and lawmakers to take a long, hard look at the human cost of cheap clothes.
A baby boy was born under the rubble shortly after the collapse.

Western companies choose Bangladesh for its low wages and fast production.
But the cheap cost and quick delivery comes at a human cost: factories often use child workers, and forced pregnant women to work until just before their due dates.
Customers shopping for budget fashions may not be able to forget the image of the crushed workers when they see a "Made in Bangladesh" label.

Spencer Hawes has spent seven times as long in the NBA as he did at the University of Washington, where he starred for one season before becoming a lottery pick in the draft.
"No offense to some of the sciences and humanities and whatnot," Hawes said, "but it\'s not really my passion or proved to be that helpful later on in life."
"It\'s just so hard to do it," point guard Austin Rivers said of going back to college, "because you\'re so busy during the season and when you finally get time off, it\'s like, do you want to go to school or actually spend time with your family?"
He said he would prefer to take courses in the summer, meaning it could take seven or eight sessions to get his diploma.
Many like the convenience of online classes but others have picked majors that lend themselves to more direct interaction with classmates and teachers.

Eleven players on the team do not have a college degree, and each said they planned to get one.
Plus, they rarely have a day off during the playing season, which can last eight months.
Rivers spent only one year in college before before becoming a professional basketball player.
Rivers said he would prefer to take courses in the summer, even though it will take him a long time to finish that way.
Rivers is inspired by the example of his father, Doc, who was also a professional basketball player.

Shopping while black, they say, can be a humiliating experience.
Much attention has been paid to the issue over the years \u2014 Oprah Winfrey complained that a Swiss clerk did not think she could afford a $38,000 handbag, and even President Barack Obama has said he was once followed in stores.
"You can\'t assume it doesn\'t happen just because it doesn\'t happen to you."
In a lawsuit filed last week, the 19-year-old said that he bought a Ferragamo belt at the Manhattan store, and when he left he was accosted by undercover city police officers.
He was arrested and detained, though he showed police the receipt, the debit card he used and identification, the lawsuit said.
For Yvonne Chan, the reports were a painful reminder of when she worked in a liquor store in a predominantly white Massachusetts town.
Those skewed views can affect who gets arrested for retail theft, said Jerome Williams, a business professor at Rutgers University who has studied marketplace discrimination.
Statistics showing that black customers steal more "are not really an indication of who\'s shoplifting," he said.

Experts at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam authenticated the 1888 landscape "Sunset at Montmajour" with the help of Vincent Van Gogh\'s letters, chemical analysis of the pigments and X-rays of the canvas.
The roughly 37-by-29-inch "Sunset at Montmajour" depicts a dry landscape of twisting oak trees, bushes and sky, and was done during the period when Van Gogh was increasingly adopting the thick "impasto" brush strokes that became typical of his work in the final years of his short life.
Fabre never recorded selling the work, and the painting disappeared from history until it reappeared in 1970 in the estate of Norwegian industrialist Christian Nicolai Mustad.
The Mustad family said Mustad purchased it in 1908 as a young man in one of his first forays into art collecting, but was soon told by the French ambassador to Sweden that it was a fake.
"That may be a painful admission, given that the same museum is now attributing it to Van Gogh, but it is understandable," since experts had no information about what the painting depicted, the Burlington Magazine article said.
Teio Meedendorp, one of three experts who worked on the project, said his predecessors might also have been confused because the painting was done at a "transitional" moment in Van Gogh\'s style.
But when the museum took a fresh look at the work in 2011, its experts had the advantage of a new compendium of all Van Gogh\'s letters, and they were able to identify for the first time the exact location "Sunset" depicts: Montmajour hill, near Arles.
Van Gogh mentioned the painting in two other letters the same summer.
Museum director Axel Rueger, at an unveiling ceremony, called the discovery a "once-in-a-lifetime experience."

This summer, police in Ferguson, Missouri, used surplus U.S. military equipment during protests.
Now, President Barack Obama is ordering up new rules for giving local police agencies access to such weapons.
The proposal includes $75 million that would help with purchasing as many as 50,000 cameras.
For example, there is no clear sign that all police are properly trained and certified to use the military-grade equipment they receive.
The results of the review come a week after a grand jury in St. Louis County chose not to bring the Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson, to trial for the fatal shooting of Michael Brown.
It also brought attention to the use of military-grade equipment by local law enforcement officials in their response.
The White House will issue an executive order to direct the Pentagon and all other federal agencies that run the surplus programs.
At the top of the agenda was finding ways to build trust between police and communities, an aide to the president said.
Obama told his staff to write an executive order to help resolve the issue.
It requires non-police officials to review and authorize the transfer of equipment, such as small arms and armored vehicles, before it can be sent to their communities.
In addition, Obama is setting up a task force to make recommendations for fighting crime while still building public trust.

However, in the Wall Street Journal piece, Swift had important points to make about the devaluation of music.
Many in the music industry see streaming as the only hope for increasing revenue.
Rather than letting you own your collection, the music business is moving toward a model similar to on-demand cable TV or Netflix, in which the entirety of music history is (theoretically) available whenever and wherever.
Yes, bands can make money (sometimes), but it also gives fans a chance to make a human connection with the artists they love.
Swift has proved herself an expert at making those connections.
And with Swift pulling her music off Spotify, she strengthens her bond with her followers by making them have to buy her album to prove how much they love her.
Music listeners have a question they must answer: to stream, or not to stream?
"Music should not be free," she insisted.

"Snakebites," said lead author Luis Fernando Chaves, an ecologist at the Nagasaki University Institute of Tropical Medicine in Japan, "don\'t get the attention they deserve, even though they are a major problem."
After all, snakebites affect 2.5 million people around the world annually, and 400,000 of those people suffer serious medical consequences (such as nerve damage or amputations) and 85,000 of them will die.
And because snakes are ectothermic, or coldblooded, they rely on the environment to regulate their body temperature, which means their behavior might be highly influenced by the changing weather patterns induced by climate change.
And finally, Costa Rica is in just the right spot to experience some serious weather pattern changes thanks to a phenomenon known as El Nino Southern Oscillation, which is a pattern of fluctuating surface temperature in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean.
This snakebite increase seems to disproportionately affect people living in poor, rural areas, Chaves said.
And because snakes are ectothermic, or coldblooded, they rely on the environment to regulate their body temperature, which means their behavior might be highly influenced by the changing weather patterns induced by climate change.
The scientists found that the rate of snakebites surged during the hot phase of El Nino, which is probably because snakes become more active and might wander farther as it gets warmer, perhaps running into humans in the process.
"So this raises the question of, OK, what do you do to decrease the risk of the people that are worse off economically \u2014 which kind of politics can the government implement?"
The findings were described in the journal Science Advances.
They reveal another complexity of the effects of climate change \u2014 both on animal populations and the way it affects human disease for people with different amounts of money.

Anil, a medical student in southern India who asked that his full name be withheld, was selling a tiny wireless earpiece, scarcely bigger than the head of a pin.
"There\'s no way anyone can even make out you using the device," says Anil, who found the earpieces in the United States and imports them in bulk, selling three or four a week on eBay to high school and college students.
Some schools installed closed-circuit cameras to monitor testing rooms.
Still, India\'s national elections, which began this month, billed as the world\'s biggest democratic exercise, "are likely to be freer and fairer than the exams," journalist Mridula Chari wrote on Scroll, a news website.
But some say the problem became worse after a 2010 national education policy that guaranteed schooling for all children up to age 14.
Under the law, no student will be left back until the eighth grade or forced to take a board exam until the 10th grade.
"One hundred percent, we can stop this problem," said Lakshmikant Pande, chairman of the Mumbai division of the board of education in the western state of Maharashtra.
Veteran teachers remain skeptical, saying that school principals often are reluctant to report cheating for fear of damaging their reputations.
They also said there is little incentive for a teacher to testify to a cheating case, which can trigger a laborious formal investigation.
Nigudkar, the English teacher, said that about a decade ago, the son of a senior Indian Railways official hired a lowly train conductor to take the 10th-grade exam for him.
Yet long after his graduation, the case remains before the police, Nigudkar said, with the teacher who nabbed the cheat forced to appear at least once a year at a court proceeding.
"We learned a lesson from that," said another English teacher, Akhil Bhosle.

Even for those not attending college, test results are important for entering job training programs, which can offer a ladder up to the middle class.
But for every comical-sounding contraption like the one Anil was selling, more extreme examples of cheating come to light once exam season begins each February.
At a school in Allahabad, in northern India, members of an inspection team were attacked with bombs after catching two students cheating.

Baseball, the only major sport without a time element, could soon be on the clock.
Baseball games consistently have increased in length in the past few decades.
The time of an average game has increased from 2 hours, 23 minutes in 1950 to 2:33 in 1981 to more than three hours this season.
Strikeouts steadily have increased for the entire previous century and especially in the past 10 seasons.
Through Friday, nine-inning games under the new rules averaged 2 hours, 20 minutes, while nine-inning games elsewhere averaged 2:49.
Whether the experimental rules make it to the major leagues, and to what extent, remains unclear.
Baseball, the only major sport without a time element, could soon be on the clock.
"Really, it\'s kind of a lot of time," said Pirates minor league right-hander Tyler Glasnow, also a fall league participant.
Baseball could have a pitch clock, a pitching-change clock, and an inning-break clock.
Umpires could soon penalize pitchers with automatic balls and batters with automatic strikes.
Teams averaged 5.14 runs per game in 2000, the highest total in the live-ball era since 1936.
The fastest pitchers, such as Mark Buehrle of the Toronto Blue Jays and Doug Fister of the Washington Nationals, average around 18 seconds between pitches.
Pitchers will be charged with a ball if they take too long, while batters will receive an automatic strike if they take too long.

In the spring of 2010, a lone gray whale was spotted off the Mediterranean coast of Israel, an event that sparked international interest for an important reason: It was the first North Atlantic sighting of a gray whale, a species nowadays restricted to the Pacific Ocean, in about 200 years.
Marine mammals, such as whales or seals, are often physically prevented from moving through the Arctic by sea ice, which gets in the way of their swimming or prohibits them from coming up to breathe.
While no one can say for sure yet what consequences these types of movements could have, McKeon and his colleagues discuss a number of possible outcomes in the paper.
One example the authors point to is the Great American Biotic Interchange, which occurred several million years ago when the isthmus of Panama formed, allowing land animals a bridge to cross between North and South America.
As the authors note, the fossil record indicates that in this case, mammals from North America invaded South America and outcompeted many of the native species there for resources.
This information can help inform conservation tactics moving forward, including the need for updated international conservation agreements.

As a result, mammals from North America invaded South America and outcompeted many of the native species there for resources.
However, she noted that as access increases and other animals start passing through the Arctic, "new environmental protections may need to be put in place."
At this point, though, scientists can only wait and see.
Toyota Motor Corp. is harboring big ambitions to become a significant player in the growing market for robots that help the elderly and other people get around in everyday life.
Toyota last month announced a $1 billion investment in a research company headed by robotics expert Gill Pratt in Silicon Valley to develop artificial intelligence and robotics.
"We are preparing for a future in which people may not be able to drive cars, or they may need artificial intelligence to support them to drive, and once they get off their cars they may need help from partner robots," said Akifumi Tamaoki, general manager of Toyota\'s partner robot division.
Some of that impetus comes from the focus of the auto and tech industries on using artificial intelligence to develop cars that can drive autonomously.

Those that complete the program are designated "China Ready" \u2014 a seal of approval they can use in overtures to the Chinese travel market.
But U.S. tour operators who specialize in handling the logistics for big group tours say that the main draws, especially for first-timers in Los Angeles, continue to be theme parks, Hollywood, excursions to Las Vegas and Yosemite, and spending sprees in luxury shops and outlet malls.
I think it\'s a shame it\'s not featured in the itineraries right now," said Harry Chen, owner of Joy Holiday, a Bay Area-based company that regularly runs tours of Los Angeles.
Even without the big tour groups, the Getty and other art museums have a chance to attract increasing numbers of Chinese visitors \u2014 albeit more likely by the carload than the busload.
Providing museum audio tours in Chinese and adding Chinese dishes to menus at food concessions are also desirable but not mandated.
The Getty estimates it hands out about 100 audio devices daily that provide a guide to collection highlights in Mandarin.
With a series of clicks, masterpieces became souvenirs to share with her friends back home in Hangzhou, China.

The Getty and other Los Angeles museums increasingly have their eyes on people like the Wus.

In 2008, the Getty Center became the first Los Angeles museum to host a tour group from China after the Chinese government lifted restrictions on traveling to the U.S.

They show the increase in tourism from mainland China, as the country becomes richer and more Chinese can afford to travel.
The Getty is trying to attract these new Chinese tourists with things like free admission, its beautiful garden, and a tram ride to the hilltop the museum sits on in Brentwood with beautiful views of the city.
The Los Angeles tourism board launched this program last year to help businesses of all kinds become magnets for Chinese vacationers.
But he says not many people are going to be interested in going to a museum.
Students typically come for longer stays and have time to explore Los Angeles in greater depth.

In response to a growing measles outbreak that started at Disneyland a month ago, health officials in Orange County, California, ordered about two dozen high school students to stay home from school because they may not have been vaccinated against the disease.
Spread by simply coughing and sneezing, measles can be contagious for four days before the rash appears and four days after.
However, some parents choose not to give their children the shots because of personal beliefs.
At S. A. Moffett Elementary, 10 percent were not vaccinated.
In 1977, about 50,000 students in Los Angeles County were told to stay home from school until they could confirm that had been vaccinated or were getting the shots.
Within days, most them returned to school having been vaccinated, and the measles cases dropped quickly.
But the outbreak worries her, and she said her daughter will get vaccinated next month.
"It was a hard decision," she added.

As an outbreak of measles spreads in California, health officials in the state ordered about two dozen students at one high school to stay home until they could prove they have been vaccinated against the disease.
Spread by coughing and sneezing, measles can be contagious four days before the rash appears and four days after.
One mother, at Mariners Park in Newport Beach, said she chose what shots to give to her 2 1/2-year-old daughter.
Instead of following official recommendations, she took the advice of "The Vaccine Book" by Dr. Robert Sears, which skips or delays some shots.
I wanted to be informed and not trust what medical professionals said," said the mother, Stephanie, who asked that her last name not be used.

"Closely following events in the Swedish territorial waters may become a game changer of the security in the whole Baltic Sea region," Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics wrote on Twitter.
The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper even speculated that the submarine hunt could be a ploy staged by the Swedish military to boost its defense budget, which has undergone a series of cuts since the Cold War.
A Russian Defense Ministry official quoted by the Tass news agency pointed fingers at a Dutch submarine that participated in an exercise with the Swedish navy last week.
On Sunday, they released a photograph taken at a distance of what they said could be the mystery vessel \u2014 a dark speck surrounded by foaming water.

With theme park lines only getting longer, parks like Disney World in Florida are investing big money to make wait time less boring, more comfortable and, in the process, seemingly shorter.
"If you reduce the wait, whether real or perceived, it is critical," said Jim MacPhee, senior vice president at Walt Disney World Parks, which has launched an extensive effort to inject more fun in ride lines.
Attendance for the top 20 major theme parks in North America has grown 7 percent from 2007 to 2012, according to estimates by Aecom, a Los Angeles engineering and consulting firm.
That means a lot of time is spent standing in lines.

Ever notice how robust and chipper former Republican presidential nominees Mitt Romney and John McCain are compared with a graying President Barack Obama these days?
The findings might even whittle the outsize pool of Republicans vying for the job.
Dr. Michael Roizen, a preventive medicine specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, has asserted that the typical president ages two years for every year he is in office (no data are available \u2014 yet \u2014 on how a woman would age in office).
Olshanksy, a professor of public health at the University of Illinois, found that 23 of 34 presidents who died of natural causes "lived beyond the average life expectancy for men of the same age when they were inaugurated, even if they hypothetically aged at twice the normal rate while in office."
Last year, a widely cited paper conducted a rigorous test of "male idiot theory" and concluded that, indeed, men are idiots.
The latest research adds to a surprisingly robust line of research: whether winning accolades, honors and elections actually confers longevity.
To do so, it drew on close to three centuries of electoral results in Austria, Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United States.

Like those pieces, the objects from the S\xe3o Jos\xe9 will personalize the "grand historical story" of slavery, said curator Paul Gardullo.
The loan agreement represents a milestone for the Slave Wreck Project, a global effort launched in 2008 to study the slave trade through the discovery and archeological study of shipwrecks.
In 2008, researchers with the Slave Wreck Project chose the site as its pilot project and began to explore the underwater location and conduct research in the archives of cities it was thought to have visited.
Officials involved in the project are in Cape Town this week for a series of discussions and workshops about the maritime archaeological effort.

The artifacts represent a significant addition to the 33,000-item collection of the newest Smithsonian museum, which is set to open next year on the Mall.
The agreement between the Iziko Museums and the Smithsonian calls for the objects to be on loan for at least 10 years, Bunch said.

Women comprise 14 percent of the active duty military.
According to the Pentagon, 152 female troops have been killed while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Serving in a combat-facing unit is a stepping-stone to higher rank and leadership commands.
Soldiers who drive fuel trucks, provide medical support or even sort mail can come under fire in modern warfare.
Sixty-six percent of people polled by the Pew Research Center said women should be allowed to serve in fighting units, while just 26 percent said that women should not.
Pew said both women and men were equally supportive of the move, but that older Americans were less in favor of women serving in combat than were younger Americans.
Nearly half those surveyed said the decision would make no difference in the effectiveness of the military and 29 percent said it would make the armed services more effective.
According to The New York Times, the Pentagon has no plans to lower its fitness requirements.
"So I think, you know, down the road, we\'re going to look back in the distance and say, boy, that was a lot of fuss over nothing."
Wars of the future will be fought with American women on the front lines and the public has no problem with it.
In fact, not many people do think female troops should be confined to desk jobs.

Overall, Latinos in California have lower incomes, education and job skills than the average white Californian.
"We need to recognize how important these people are and how urgent their success is for the well-being of everyone."
Now we are becoming equals.
Nationally, Latino purchasing power has increased from $700 billion in 2000 to $1.3 trillion in 2015, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.
She described her generation as college educated and living out the dreams of their parents.

Although Latinos have made huge strides, they also face many challenges.
A study published last year found that second-generation Mexican Americans have done better than their immigrant parents.
Recently, Isaac Galvan became the first Latino elected to the City Council.
Across Los Angeles, Latinos say education and voting are crucial to their future.
Along the way, the family moved from a poor neighborhood to a wealthy one.
Although Latinos have made huge advances, they also face many challenges.

In 2013, California gave more money to help students who are low-income and learning English.
Inside a building next to Lake Michigan, the Civil War is still in action: cannons boom, smoke wafts across a battlefield and men in blue and gray run screaming at each other.
Using 360-degree technology and 11-foot-tall screens, the Civil War Museum this month opened an 11-minute movie called "Seeing the Elephant."
"Our idea was to produce a 360-degree film that puts the viewer in the middle of the action, sort of a living, breathing cyclorama," said Doug Dammann, curator at the Civil War Museum in Kenosha.
The panoramic paintings were first developed in Europe before migrating to the United States in the 1880s, often featuring huge paintings of Civil War battles.
A handful of cycloramas can still be seen more than 125 years later, including one in Gettysburg, Pa., and another in Atlanta that has a Milwaukee connection.
Plans got underway last year with a script written and the hiring of a film production company from Boston for the $1 million film, which was funded through private donations.
The call went out to Civil War re-enactors from throughout the Midwest as well as other states, and Old World Wisconsin was the location chosen for filming, particularly the Norwegian farmstead area, Catholic church and town hall.
The theater features eight projectors and seven speakers above viewers plus speakers underneath the platform and LED lighting.

A special 360-degree camera, which was actually nine high-definition digital cameras attached to a periscope rig, was used to film the battle scenes with Noll and the camera operator huddled inside the contraption while re-enactors shot at each other.
Much of the dialogue of the three main characters joining the Union Army was taken from actual letters and journals, Herdegen said.
The film\'s title was chosen because "seeing the elephant" was a common phrase used by Civil War soldiers to describe their first experience of battle.

"We talked about doing an actual battle, but the problem is when you do that some expert will come up and say, well the fence is in the wrong place," said Herdegen.
Oftentimes they featured huge paintings of Civil War battles.
However, it is based on an incident that happened right before the Second Battle of Bull Run as the Union called it, or Second Battle of Manassas as the Confederacy called it.

The justices said in a 6-3 ruling that the subsidies that 8.7 million people currently receive to make insurance affordable do not depend on where they live, as opponents contended.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, a dissenter in 2012, was part of the majority on Thursday.
Limiting the subsidies only to individuals in states with their own exchanges could well push insurance markets in the other states "into a death spiral," Roberts wrote.
Scalia said that Roberts\' 2012 decision that upheld the law and his opinion on Thursday "will publish forever the discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites."
Nationally, 10.2 million people have signed up for health insurance under the Obama health overhaul.
That includes the 8.7 million people who are receiving an average subsidy of $272 a month to help pay their insurance premiums.
In the challengers\' view, the phrase "established by the state" demonstrated that subsidies were to be available only to people in states that set up their own exchanges.
It requires almost everyone to be insured and provides financial help to consumers who otherwise would spend too much of their paycheck on their premiums.
The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a major challenge to the Affordable Care Act in a ruling that preserves health insurance for millions of Americans.
At the court, Chief Justice John Roberts, who is considered conservative, again voted with his liberal colleagues in support of the law.
Scalia said these "will publish forever the discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites."
The administration, Democrats in Congress and 22 states responded that it would make no sense to interpret the law that way.
The point of the last piece, the subsidies, is to make sure enough people have insurance.
Several states told the court that they had no indication they had to set up their own exchange for their residents to get tax credits.
The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a major challenge to the Affordable Care Act in a ruling that preserves health insurance for millions of Americans.
Republicans have voted more than 50 times to undo the law, also known as Obamacare.
Of those receiving subsidies, 6.4 million were at risk of losing that aid.

Roberts wrote that the financial help should not be limited only to people in states with their own insurance marketplaces.
Scalia had harsh words for his opponents on the court who support the law.
The idea behind the law was to decrease the number of people without health insurance and increase the number of people with health insurance.
The Supreme Court on Thursday issued a ruling that preserves health insurance for millions of Americans.
That is because about three dozen states decided against creating their own health insurance marketplaces.
Their vote was 6 to 3.
They do not think the government should require people to have health insurance or make health insurance cheaper.
It meant that they would not have to deal with a flood of sick people without health insurance.
The health care law was 900 pages long.
About three dozen states decided against creating their own health insurance marketplaces.
At a graveyard in the western town of Soma, where coal mining has been the main industry for decades, women wailed loudly in an improvised display of mourning.
Turkish President Abdullah Gul, visiting Soma on Thursday, described the events in Soma as "a huge disaster."
His party swept local elections in March despite a corruption scandal that forced him to dismiss four government ministers in December and later also implicated him and family members.
Yildiz said emergency crews had detected a drop in carbon monoxide levels "which means that the fire has gotten smaller."
At a graveyard in the western town of Soma, where coal mining has been the main industry for decades, women wailed loudly in an improvised display of mourning.
He was forced to take refuge at a supermarket after angry crowds called him a murderer and a thief, in a reference to alleged corruption, and clashed with police.
Turkish newspapers Cumhuriyet, Milliyet and others on Thursday printed photographs they said were of an Erdogan aide kicking a protester who was on the ground and being held by special forces police.
At a graveyard in the western town of Soma, where coal mining has been the main industry for decades, women wailed loudly in mourning.
No miner has been brought out alive since dawn on Wednesday from the Soma coal mine where the underground explosion and fire took place.
Energy Minister Taner Yildiz on Thursday announced that a fire inside the mine was dying down.
He offered hope that rescuers would soon be able to speed up their search for those missing.
Erdogan was not welcome during his visit to the area Wednesday.
Turkish newspapers Cumhuriyet, Milliyet and others on Thursday printed photographs they said were of an Erdogan aide, identified as Yusuf Yerkel, kicking a protester.
They show the protester on the ground being held down by special forces police.
His party swept local elections in March despite a corruption scandal that forced him to fire four government ministers in December and later also implicated him and family members.
In Istanbul, a group chanted anti-government slogans and carried a large banner that read: "It\'s not an accident, it\'s murder."
During a visit to Soma, he said, "The pain is felt by us all."
Near them, backhoes dug row upon row of graves.
He confirmed there was a scuffle as Erdogan entered a building.
The government has said 787 people were inside the coal mine at the time of the explosion.
A major investigation into whether art hanging in Dutch museums may have once been Nazi loot has yielded an unexpectedly large result: 139 suspect works, including ones by masters like Matisse, Klee and Kandinsky.
All Dutch museums that hold art from before the war participated in the review.
The museums said they are in the process of contacting or seeking the heirs, including those of Jewish art dealer Albert Stern, the deceased owner of the Matisse.
Other paintings included works by old Dutch masters such as Jacob Cuyp, Impressionist Isaac Israels and Modernists like Wassily Kandinsky.
Attendees from 44 nations proclaimed the Washington Principles, declaring that "every effort should be made to publicize art that is found to have been confiscated by the Nazis" and have it returned.
Many American and British museums have already conducted thorough investigations that have led to the return of looted art, though nothing has been done on a nationwide basis.
The Dutch investigation was the second in the Netherlands, with the first one in 2006 focusing only on works that were bought and sold during the war.
"We\'re not the first with this investigation, but thanks to this investigation we\'re not far behind," said Rudi Ekkart, a professor of art history at the University of Utrecht who headed the investigating commission.
Critics wondered what took so long "While I applaud the Dutch for doing this, I also have to say: where were you all this time?"
Russia rejects the Washington Principles, saying art taken during World War II are its rightful "trophies."
Switzerland endorses the principles in theory, but has not conducted systematic research and turns a blind eye to the possibility of looted art hidden in its bank vaults, Marinello said.
A major investigation into whether art hanging in Dutch museums may have once been Nazi loot has yielded an unexpectedly large result: 139 suspect works, including ones by masters like Matisse, Klee and Kandinsky.
One painting by Cuyp had been purchased in good faith by the Museum of Dordrecht in 2002.
He said many countries, including the United States, should be doing more to help recover looted art.
A major investigation into whether art hanging in Dutch museums may have once been Nazi loot has yielded an unexpectedly large result: 139 suspect works, including ones by masters like Matisse, Klee and Kandinsky.
A major investigation of art hanging in Dutch museums has just been completed and the results are unexpected: 139 works may have once been Nazi loot from World War II.
The bombshell announcement on Tuesday by the museums raises a question: Why has it taken them nearly 70 years to thoroughly examine their collections after World War II?
One of them is French artist Henri Matisse\'s 1921 "Odalisque" painting of a half-nude reclining woman.
They have identified the names of 20 people whose art was taken, or looted, and linked them with 61 of the works.
Other pieces uncovered in the investigation included drawings, like one by Paul Klee.
One painting by Dutch artist Jacob Cuyp had been purchased in good faith by the Museum of Dordrecht in 2002.
Then the latest Dutch investigation revealed it had belonged to a Jewish woman.

The Dutch investigation was the second in the Netherlands.
Critics wondered what took so long.
In addition, there are probably pieces still held in private homes that will be eventually detected.

STERDAM - A major investigation of art hanging in Dutch museums just concluded.
The goal was to find out if any of the art was once stolen by the Nazis during the 1930s and 1940s.
They include ones by important artists like Matisse, Klee and Kandinsky.
The announcement Tuesday by the museums was a bombshell.
It also raises a question: Why has it taken them nearly 70 years to examine their collections after World War II?
Or they were sold by owners who were forced against their will to sell them, he said.
It is a painting of a half-nude reclining woman.
He said many countries should be doing more to help recover looted art.
He called that a conservative estimate and said another 20,000 Russian troops were right over the Russian border.
"Over the past two weeks we have noted a significant escalation in both the level and sophistication of Russia\'s military interference in Ukraine," Tak said in Casteau, Brussels.
"We have also detected large quantities of advanced weapons, including air defense systems, artillery, tanks, and armored personnel carriers being transferred to separatist forces in eastern Ukraine," he said.
The leader of the insurgency, Alexander Zakharchenko, said in an interview on Russian state television that 3,000 to 4,000 Russians have fought on the separatist side since the armed conflict began in April.
The tank\'s presence, he said in note Thursday, "strongly supports the contention that Russia is supplying arms to separatist forces."
Russian forces, she said, are being sent 30 miles (48 kilometers) inside Ukraine, without them or their families knowing where they are going.
In Donetsk, the largest rebel-held city, 11 people were killed by shelling overnight, the city said Thursday.
Russian tanks and military vehicles fired missiles at a border post in southeastern Ukraine Thursday, a top Ukrainian official said.
The U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) provided evidence that Russian had invaded southeastern Ukraine.
The southeastern town of Novoazovsk appeared under the control of Russia and rebels in Ukraine that want to join Russia.
They want the parts of Ukraine they live in to separate from Ukraine and join Russia.
Fears are growing that Russia is widening the conflict.
Some blocks on trade, or sanctions, already exist.
The earlier sanctions were meant to punish Russia for taking over the Ukrainian region of Crimea in March.
NATO said they prove that Russian combat soldiers are operating inside Ukraine.
Alexander Zakharchenko is the leader of the insurgency.
It accuses Russia of sending in tanks, rocket launchers and armored vehicles.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that Russia was being dishonest about its actions, even to its own people.
That changed in April when the Army issued sweeping changes in how women in uniform can wear their hair, along with new regulations about tattoos.
The rules specifically ban certain hairstyles, including twists, large cornrow braids and dreadlocks, popular among black women.
And that hit a nerve already tenderized by generations of debate within the black community over what constitutes "good" or "bad" hair.
In the text of the regulation, the Army says it is needed to ensure a "uniformity" of appearance as well as soldiers\' ability to wear headgear unimpeded by their hair.
"But she feels bad that she had to be put in the position where she was made to do this.
However, on Tuesday, Hagel directed the military to reconsider the new policies.
The policy outlaws tattoos on the face, neck, lower arms and hands.
She figured going natural would be healthier, safer and easier to maintain.
"In order for the military to make changes, they have to admit they were uneducated, and say they made a mistake," Jacobs said.
"I never had anyone say anything to me about my hair," Jacobs, 25,  said.
They asked Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to rethink the hair rule.
Jacobs said she stopped straightening her hair about four years ago.
They were not meant to target black people or be hurtful, Hagel wrote to the Black Caucus.
Dusbiber is not the first educator to suggest moving away from Shakespeare in the classroom.

The soil in Chandipur village in southwestern Bangladesh has become increasingly salty because of incursions of seawater.
The situation became particularly acute in the aftermath of Cyclone Aila in 2009, which brought storm surges that broke embankments and flooded farmland.
"There is no country with such population density where natural resources are stretched to their very limits," says Craig Meisner, south Asia regional director and country director for Bangladesh at WorldFish, an international nonprofit organization headquartered in Malaysia.
WorldFish implemented the vertical gardens in southern Bangladesh, along with other means of coping with climate change.
Working with local nonprofits, WorldFish trained about 200 villagers in four districts in saline-affected areas of southwestern Bangladesh to make vertical gardens.
Finding enough fresh water for her garden can be a challenge, she admits.

The soil in Chandipur village in southwestern Bangladesh has become increasingly salty because of incursions of seawater.
As storms have flooded the village of Chandipur with seawater, the soil there has become increasingly salty.
Vertical gardens consist of a variety of containers in backyards and on rooftops, packed with soil and crops.
They let farmers continue to cultivate vegetables despite the damage done to farmland.
These included pumpkins, squash, cauliflower, tomatoes, spinach and chili peppers.
Yet the people of Bangladesh live in an area about the size of Iowa.
Growing enough food for all of those people is already a challenge in such a small country.
Working with local nonprofits, WorldFish trained about 200 villagers in four districts in southwestern Bangladesh to make vertical gardens.
At this time of year, soil tends to be less salty because heavy rains from July to October wash salt away.
Small containers, which cost about $1.30 to $2.00 to build, can produce up to 17 1/2 pounds of vegetables in one season.
Larger containers can produce more than 220 pounds of vegetables, at a cost of around $11.50 to $13.00 for materials and seeds.
Finding enough fresh water for her new gardens is a challenge, she admits.
Still, she is able to grow crops with soil that, not long ago, was too salty to be of any use.

Flooding is a frequent problem in Chandipur, a village in southwestern Bangladesh.
For the past three years, however, hundreds of villagers have found a new way to grow crops.
This means they can make it through a storm without the soil, and crops, being destroyed.
Shakuri Rani Debnath, who lives in Chandipur, says her vertical gardens produced more than 400 pounds of fruits and vegetables this summer.
They included pumpkins, squash, cauliflower, tomatoes, spinach and chili peppers.
Vertical gardens were brought to villages like Chandipur by an organization called WorldFish.
Growing the vertical gardens is easy.
It takes up a small corner of her dirt yard.
Nevertheless, each season it produces hundreds of pounds of pumpkins, gourds, green beans, eggplant, red amaranth, beets, carrots, cauliflower, coriander, cabbage, green chili peppers and spinach.
Another garden on her roof is producing gourds.
This goes a long way for the rural poor in Bangladesh, who survive on a few dollars a day.

Augustyn has heard critics of the Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports network question how effective these efforts will be when students no longer receive tokens or rewards for good behavior.
"Now we\'re being proactive and not reactive."
After the school\'s students watch the video, Ronan and other student leaders will hand out "Stallion Medallions" to classmates who try to stop bullying or who reinforce positive behavior.
By 2011, more than 250 school leaders from across Illinois attended a forum to learn how the network could be used to tackle bullying.
When school started this month, he wore his neon-orange "Expect Respect" T-shirt with high hopes.
Students can receive a token for telling a classmate to stop picking on someone, for instance, or by sitting with a new student at lunch.
"Teaching them to show respect to each other is more effective than saying \'Don\'t be a bully,\'" said Brian Meyer.
Under the program, schools acknowledge that all students are capable of bullying and being bullied.
Then faculty and students are trained in a schoolwide approach called "Stop, Walk and Talk."
But as bullying was blamed for shootings and suicides, parents started lobbying for help and legislators got involved, said Dorothy Espelage.
Initially, when the network began 15 years ago, it focused on students with special needs or severe disciplinary problems.

Now, scientists have peered into the heart of such fire-ant rafts and discovered how the individual insects link together to create these remarkably strong yet lightweight structures.
Such insight, described in a paper in the Journal of Experimental Biology, may one day help engineers build self-healing buildings and bridges.
A recent study found that ants place their defenseless babies at the bottom of a raft to make it more buoyant overall.
Instead, researchers at Georgia Tech managed to capture this complex structure using a micro CT scanner, which is typically used to image the tiny 3-D structure of bones.
They did this four times, for a total of 440 ants and a total of 2,640 legs (given that each ant has six limbs).
While most of the ants could have a maximum of five connections, some ants were about three times larger and could support 20 connections.
By creating these big spaces between each connected ant, the insects were effectively making their raft more porous, and thus less dense.
Self-healing buildings and ships, able to quickly respond to changes in their environment, may sound like technology from the future \u2014 or just straight out of science fiction.

Ants use their bodies like the beams in a building; instead of screwing or nailing those beams together, they reach out and touch each other.
They did this four times, for a total of 440 ants and a total of 2,640 legs (given that each ant has six limbs).
These ants sure knew how to get a grip on each other.
By creating these big spaces between each connected ant, the insects were effectively making their raft more porous, and thus less dense.
But "from the ants\' perspective, this is an ancient thing," Hu said.
With "more parking spots for little legs," as Hu put it, their enormous bodies acted as hubs for limbs.

Fire ants may be famous for their vicious sting.
They have discovered how the individual insects link their bodies together to create these remarkably strong yet lightweight structures.
This knowledge, described in a paper in the Journal of Experimental Biology, may one day help engineers build self-healing buildings and bridges.
They then flash-froze the ants and examined them under the scanner.
They found, to their surprise, that 99 percent of the legs were linked together, while only 26 remained unconnected.
The scientists also found that the ants positioned themselves on a 90-degree angle to each other.
While most of the ants could have a maximum of five connections, some ants were about three times larger and could connect up to 20 legs.
With "more parking spots for little legs," as Hu put it, their enormous bodies acted as hubs for limbs, like a tiny bicycle wheel hub connecting the spokes.

Now, scientists have learned how to peer into the heart of fire-ant rafts.
They have discovered how the individual insects link their bodies together to create remarkably strong yet lightweight structures.
Instead of screwing or nailing those beams together, the ants reach out and touch each other.
"It\'s like their bodies are covered in Velcro," said study co-author David Hu.
But the medical device is way too big.
They then flash-froze the ants in place and examined them under the scanner.
The scientists also found that the ants positioned themselves at a 90-degree angle to each other.
By creating big spaces between each connected ant, the insects made their raft lighter, and thus less dense.
Hug said the ant raft was quite a bit like bone in that way.
This makes the raft better able to float.
All the ant bodies are blocking the view.
The ants sure knew how to get a grip on each other.
This knowledge may one day help engineers build buildings and bridges that can repair themselves.
Scientists are just beginning to understand how complicated ant architecture really is.
They froze the ants in place and then examined them under the scanner.
In buildings, hubs are important points of strength.
The gap between rich and poor is widening in the United States and more and more children are growing up in low-income households.
The Common Core, a set of tougher classroom standards adopted by more than 40 states, has further inflamed the critics.
"We need fewer, better and fairer assessments," Susie Morrison, chief education officer and deputy superintendent at the Illinois State Board of Education, said at a recent meeting of state school officials in Washington.
But not all tests are equally valuable, she said: "Some assessments used by local districts can and should go away, in our opinion."
"This is not a valid way to measure an entire child," said Jensen, a former kindergarten and first-grade teacher who\'s the mother of two high school students.
"None of this has anything to do with better education.

"My son\'s make his teachers look bad, and they work so hard with him.
This spring, Congress will discuss education as lawmakers attempt to rewrite No Child Left Behind.
It required annual testing to make sure that children were learning what they were supposed to learn.
It would give the states, not the government, the job of ensuring that schools are doing good work.
Meanwhile, complaints this year about standardized testing have, if anything, grown greater.
"We need fewer, better and fairer assessments," said Susie Morrison, chief education officer and deputy superintendent at the Illinois State Board of Education.
Morrison said that parents deserve to know how their children are doing.
Testing clarifies what students know and do not know before they get to that point, she said.
"None of this has anything to do with better education."
In her own family, Jensen said, her son, a ninth-grader, is a good student but a poor test-taker while her daughter, a high school senior, does well on them.
She said the tests say more about the students than the teachers.
This spring, Congress will discuss education as lawmakers attempt to rewrite No Child Left Behind.
An agreement in the Senate on updating the education bill might reduce the pressure on schools to test.
North Carolina, Texas and Virginia have all reduced the number of state-required tests.
The debate over whether students take too many standardized tests is heating up.
This spring, Congress will discuss education  as lawmakers attempt to rewrite a 2002 law.
Testing makes it clear what students know and do not know before they get to that point, she said.
Education Secretary Arne Duncan wants the federal government to remain in charge of testing.
However, he has said that students, parents and teachers do have a real complaint.
In Florida, Rosemarie Jensen is one of the leaders of United Opt Out.
Testing is not a good way to measure a child, said Jensen, a former kindergarten teacher who has two children in high school.
Some of them were just not useful.
As standardized testing seems to be on the rise in schools, some parents say test refusal is growing.
The No Child Left Behind law was intended to improve education in all schools.
She said that parents deserve to know how their children are doing in school.
The group encourages parents to opt out, or refuse, standardized tests for their kids.

In her own family, Jensen said, her son is a good student but a poor test-taker, while her daughter does well on tests.
The Senate is one of the two branches of Congress, which makes laws for the country.
A large number of students graduate from high school but need special classes in reading and math before they go to college.
Schools need to give help to kids who are not learning the things they should be learning.
That has led some Illinois community colleges to experiment with a new model that takes a real-world approach.
Almy said students who struggle with math can answer practical problems taken from real life.
But math literacy appears bound to catch on.
Almy said she hoped the math literacy programs will make education more realistic.
Twenty-year-old Kelsey Pearsall-Brandon wants to be a police officer, but one thing is standing in her way.
"Eventually we\'ll have most if not all colleges doing this," said Brian Durham of the Illinois Community College Board.
She must take remedial math to teach her the math skills she should have learned in high school.
Also, students majoring in science or technology will need to learn more advanced math.
And the regulators are from the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial-rocket launches in addition to monitoring the airlines.
This week, at a congressional hearing and an industry conference in Washington, FAA officials and space attorneys began seriously discussing rules of the road for outer space, for such things as mining rights and safety practices.
Although there have been some broad guidelines \u2014 the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, for example, prohibits nations from claiming the moon \u2014 specific space regulations have been few and far between.
Of particular interest is one law \u2014 set to expire next year \u2014 that largely bars the FAA from restricting commercial efforts to launch humans into space.
With the FAA sidelined in part by the congressional restriction, the task of crafting regulations for space travel increasingly could fall to NASA \u2014 which is not a good thing, said Gold, who leads an FAA advisory panel.
Space law is not an area where the courts have carved much ground, either in the United States or internationally.
Of particular interest is one law \u2014 set to expire next year \u2014 that largely bars the FAA from restricting commercial efforts to launch humans into space.
Because of that, Boeing attorney Russ McMurry said regulators and lawyers might consider finding inspiration in laws once written for wooden ships.
In 2012, the California company SpaceX became the first commercial-rocket company to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.
"Maybe we should go back and look at the way we dealt with that."

This past week, at a congressional hearing and an industry conference in Washington, FAA officials and space attorneys began seriously discussing rules of the road for outer space.
There have been some broad guidelines \u2014 the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, for example, prohibits nations from claiming the moon.
U.S. Rep. Steven Palazzo, a Mississippi Republican, argued Tuesday that the law is still needed.
Palazzo, chairman of the House space subcommittee, said he fears what would happen "if the FAA begins trampling on these companies with regulations."
With the FAA sidelined in part by the congressional restriction, the task of crafting regulations for space travel increasingly could fall to NASA.
But the commercial space industry has grown rapidly in recent years.
The FAA has so far been limited by one major loophole: Once a spacecraft reaches orbit, it is largely free of regulation.
The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, for example, prohibits nations from claiming the moon.
But space regulations have been few and far between.
There are, for example, attempts to figure out how to limit the amount of dangerous "space junk" shed by spacecraft.
The FAA has so far been very limited in what it can do: Once a spacecraft reaches orbit, it is largely free of regulation.
In 2012, SpaceX became the first commercial-rocket company to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.
In the near future, he said, there will probably be more "commercial-transportation vehicles" in space.
Congressman Steven Palazzo argued Tuesday that the law is still needed.
Rules are unavoidable, said Mike Gold of Bigelow Aerospace.

Christiansburg junior Zach Comer was among the students who took part in the parking lot rally last Thursday morning.
Chet Morley, 18, graduated from Christiansburg High this year and is now attending the Berklee School of Music in Boston.
While his classmates said the flag symbolized their pride in their Confederate roots, Morley said it made him think of slavery.
Referring to the Confederate battle flag, he said: "As for me and my ancestors, it means more than that."
Students are barred from wearing any clothing that could "reflect adversely on persons due to race" and specifies that "clothing with Confederate flag symbols" falls in that category.
Montgomery County schools spokeswoman Brenda Drake said that half of all middle schools and high schools in the county do not allow the display of the Confederate battle flag.
Christiansburg junior Zach Comer was among the students who took part in the parking lot rally last Thursday morning.
Morley said he saw students wear belt buckles or t-shirts with the Confederate battle flag during his time at the school.
Teachers sometimes pointed out it was against the dress code, but others overlooked it.
Morley, who is black, said seeing the flag bothered him, but he never piped up around his white classmates who donned it.
Referring to the Confederate battle flag, he said: "As for me and my ancestors, it means more than that."
I grew up on it.
Comer said that students plan to continue the protest when they return to school on Friday by wearing their Confederate clothing again.

Teaching students alternatives to violence and improving their access to mental-health services are among the best ideas officials say they have for preventing the kind of bloodshed that has struck a long list of schools, including Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville, Pennsylvania.
Researcher Manny Sethi, an orthopedic trauma surgeon and a Vanderbilt assistant professor of orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation, said it may be necessary to teach those problem-solving skills before the high school years.
"The logical response to all of this is to recognize that schools are the first line of defense for mental-health supports for students and to recognize that we are at a shortage for support personnel," said Julia Szarko, president of the Association of School Psychologists in Pennsylvania and a school psychologist in the Central Bucks (Pa.) School District.
Szarko, who has a doctorate in school psychology, said the School District of Philadelphia last year eliminated all of its school counselors to save enough money to maintain its academic program.
"Politicians often aren\'t specific about these plans because it sounds good, but they are not willing to pay for it," said Berkowitz, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania\'s Perelman School of Medicine.
U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, a Pennsylvania Republican, has been pushing Congress for an overhaul of mental-health services.
After reviewing data on 27 programs, he and his team decided to pilot one of them \u2014 designed by Harvard psychologist Ron Slaby \u2014 in a violence-plagued Nashville middle school.
Sethi said the exercises helped students "build the machinery of understanding conflict and how it progresses and how to get yourself out of it."
On a second questionnaire, administered after the exercises, students reported that they were less likely than before to be a target of bullying, less likely to hit or push others, less likely to cheer if a fight broke out and more likely to try to defuse a potential altercation.
Instead of tailoring safety plans to their campuses, school officials often use generic plans and compound the problem with improper training of staff and students.
Teaching students alternatives to violence and improving their access to mental-health services are among the best ideas officials say they have for preventing the kind of bloodshed that has struck a long list of schools, including Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville, Pennsylvania.
But mental-health professionals in Pennsylvania schools say funding cuts in recent years have prompted across-the-board reductions in school counselors, social workers and psychologists.

A year later, mediators visited the small Finger Lakes town of Geneva, New York, after an officer shot a 33-year-old black man, and demonstrators gathered in front of the city police department.
New studies from the Center for American Progress and the National Education Association (NEA) are calling attention to this "diversity gap" at elementary and secondary schools in the United States.
It becomes easier for students to believe "when they can look and see someone who looks just like them, that they can relate to," said Gilbert, a member of the NEA\'s executive committee.
"Even in a place like North Dakota, where the students aren\'t particularly diverse relative to the rest of the country, it\'s important for our social fabric, for our sense as a nation, that students are engaging with people who think, talk and act differently than them but can also be just as effective at raising student achievement in the classroom," he said.
Jan Alderson, a science teacher at Shawnee Mission South High School in Overland Park, Kansas, saw the changes at her school.
But as the county integrated and other professions opened their ranks, education lost its "cachet" and fewer African-American students thought about becoming teachers, she said.
Twenty-six Atlanta public school educators and administrators pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges related to a massive cheating scandal.

By the end of the decade, Americans are expected to spend as much as $25 billion a year on genetic tests.
It also can be used to determine whether a person is a carrier of a disease and if there is a risk of passing it to their children.
The cost of genetic testing varies widely, from $99 for at-home kits to thousands of dollars for tests conducted at hospitals and clinics.
Critics say these tests are limited in their ability to diagnose health risks accurately.
So they could lead users to undergo unnecessary medical procedures.
Doctors say that genetic testing can be very effective in determining the best medicines for someone with a defined disease.
Her tumor was not responding to the standard medicine used to treat the cancer.
Through genetic testing, doctors discovered that drugs used on leukemia patients might work for her.
But for healthy people, who he calls the "worried well," there is little to no value in having the genome mapped.
We all want answers, he says, but "we can never say that we know exactly what will happen to anyone."
A genetic test would tell Maalouli if she carries a mutant gene associated with higher risks of those cancers.
Keegan, 30, and his wife were also thinking about starting a family and wanted to know what their chances were of passing on the mutant gene to their children.
The couple talked about checking the fertilized egg to see if it had the faulty gene before deciding to continue with the pregnancy.
Denis Keegan was suffering from kidney disease, but his doctors were struggling to pinpoint the cause, and he was out of answers.
Testing is available through a doctor or by kits that can be bought online or at a drugstore.
Denis Keegan was suffering from kidney disease, but his doctors were struggling to pinpoint the cause, and he was out of answers.
But Keegan said they thought this would be "playing God."
It could cause needless anxiety among healthy people.
The cost of genetic testing varies widely, from $99 for home kits to thousands of dollars for tests at hospitals.
It may even cause harm by raising anxiety about the odds of developing a disease.
Now 51, Maalouli and her three sisters have made an agreement.
And they may prefer not to know.
But Keegan said they then stepped back and thought this would be "playing God."
Keegan figures that even if his child does get the disease, medical treatments will improve in the future.

The DNA is usually collected from blood or saliva.
The price also changes depending on which disease the doctor is looking for.
Dr. Alexander Parker said one woman had a disease that was not getting better with the regular medicine.
For healthy people, there is little point in having these tests.
Parker said patients should talk to their doctor before taking any tests.
A genetic test would tell Maalouli if she carries the gene that gives her a higher risk for cancer.
Doctors asked his older brother and father to also give DNA to find out if Keegan had got his disease from his father.

When they grow up, the meek kids from middle school will come out on top.
Among the factors considered were how much students valued their popularity, how important appearance was in seeking out friends, and if students used drugs or had romantic relationships.
The researchers found that young teens who acted old for their age by sneaking into movies, forming early romantic relationships, shoplifting and basing friendships on appearance were seen by peers as popular.
But as these "pseudomature" teens matured, their behavior was no longer linked with popularity.
Instead, they were thought to be less socially competent by their peers and had more problems with substance abuse, said Joseph Allen, who led the study.
When they grow up, the meek kids from middle school will come out on top.
It found that they tended to develop problems with drugs and relationships by their early 20s.
Among the factors considered were how much students valued their popularity, how important appearance was in seeking out friends, and if students used drugs or had romantic relationships.
Teens are impressed by these kids, and parents are impressed too "because they think that these pseudomature kids are on the fast track," Allen said.
He added, "They are gaining the appearance of maturity, but they are not gaining actual maturity."
But as these "pseudomature" teens matured, their behavior was no longer linked with popularity.
Allen said the average "cool" teen, by age 22, compared poorly with the average teen in the study.
Among them were how much students valued their popularity, how important appearance was in seeking out friends, and if students used drugs or had romantic relationships.

onetime point of pride for the New England Patriots has suddenly skewered the NFL franchise.
For three seasons, the move paid off, with Hernandez reaching the Pro Bowl in 2011 and garnering a five-year contract extension worth as much as $40 million.
Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in the slaying of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd and is being held without bail in a Massachusetts jail.
To further distance itself from him, the franchise took the unprecedented step of a jersey exchange.
Fans with used Hernandez jerseys can swap them at the team store this weekend for those of any other player on the roster.
"Without question, the owners are talking to their general managers as soon as this happened, saying, \'Let\'s make sure this doesn\'t happen to us,\'" said former NFL coach Jimmy Johnson, who won two Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys with some troubled players on his roster.
"It\'s almost the pendulum swings the other way in that there are probably going to be some players that are able to get on the straight and narrow who are going to be bypassed because people are going to be afraid of getting into a situation like this."
"Talent is the overriding factor in the NFL.
There were warning signs with Hernandez, who had failed drug tests and run-ins with the law in college.
A scouting service that prepares confidential psychological profiles of NFL prospects determined that he enjoyed "living on the edge of acceptable behavior," according to a document obtained by the Wall Street Journal.
"That was his downfall in Denver, the ability to interact.
It\'s like (Clarett) was upset with us for drafting him."
"You can contact the league for some things, but for the most part they\'re not going to give you what people are wanting, which is a top-to-bottom full report on a guy\'s character, his police blotter, all that kind of stuff.
He said typically clubs do not hire private investigators but instead rely on their area scouts, some of them young and inexperienced, to obtain background information on prospects.
onetime point of pride for the New England Patriots has suddenly skewered the NFL franchise.
New England took a chance, however, selecting the troubled University of Florida standout in the fourth round of the 2010 draft \u2014 seemingly a bargain for a player many evaluators considered a first-round talent.
The high-profile arrest of Hernandez and the subsequent flood of information about his troubled past has sparked a debate within the NFL: When is a risky pick too risky?

"But if you don\'t have the relationship built, if it\'s a young scout that goes in there, they\'re going to protect their reputation and their head coach, and the fact that they recruited a knucklehead."

Think of receiver Randy Moss and running back Corey Dillon who had legal troubles during their careers.
Some teams thought the former Patriots tight end was too risky to draft when he came out of college.

The test found that Hernandez "may be prone to partying too much and doing questionable things that could be seen as a problem for him and his team."
That evaluation was similar to one the company prepared on Maurice Clarett.
The Patriots cut Hernandez from the team less than two hours after he was arrested on June 26.
It said Hernandez scored a lowest possible 1 out of 10 in "social maturity."

The company prepared a similar report on Maurice Clarett.
Clarett spent 3-1/2 years in prion on robbery and gun charges.
But the league usually will not give what teams want, like "a full report on a guy\'s character, his police blotter, all that kind of stuff."
President Barack Obama said Tuesday that the U.S. will do everything it can to help Nigeria find nearly [300 teenage girls](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Nigerian+schoolgirls) missing since they were kidnapped from school three weeks ago by an Islamist extremist group that has threatened to sell them.
"In the short term our goal is obviously is to help the international community, and the Nigerian government, as a team to do everything we can to recover these young ladies," Obama said in an interview with NBC\'s "Today," in some of his first public comments on what he said was a "terrible situation" in the West African nation.
Obama said the U.S. has long sought to work with Nigeria to contain Boko Haram.
They\'ve been killing people ruthlessly for many years now and we\'ve already been seeking greater cooperation with the Nigerians," Obama said in an interview with ABC News.
He said the kidnapping and subsequent outrage over Nigeria\'s inability to rescue the girls "may be the event that helps to mobilize the entire international community to finally do something against this horrendous organization that\'s perpetrated such a terrible crime."
U.S. armed forces were not being sent, Carney noted.
The statement added that Nigeria\'s security agencies are working at "full capacity" to find the girls and welcomes the addition of American "counter-insurgency know-how and expertise."
"But we\'re also going to have to deal with the broader problem of organizations like this that ... can cause such havoc in people\'s day-to-day lives," Obama said of Boko Haram.
Of that number, 276 remain in captivity and 53 managed to escape.
A smaller group of mostly male senators urged Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan to address the root causes of unrest in his country.

"And, as a father of two girls, I can\'t imagine what their parents are going through."
And that may be what will get the world to finally stop "this horrendous organization," Obama said.
But repeated offers of U.S. assistance were ignored.
"Affluenza," the affliction cited by a psychologist to argue that a North Texas teenager from a wealthy family should not be sent to prison for killing four pedestrians while driving drunk, is not a recognized diagnosis and should not be used to justify bad behavior, experts said Thursday.
The term "affluenza" was popularized in the late 1990s by Jessie O\'Neill, the granddaughter of a past president of General Motors, when she wrote the book "The Golden Ghetto: The Psychology of Affluence."
"Essentially what he (the judge) has done is slapped this child on the wrist for what is obviously a very serious offense which he would be responsible for in any other situation," Buffone said.
A message left for Boyd by The Associated Press was not returned Thursday.
"It doesn\'t sound like something that would ameliorate the punishment."
"What is the likelihood if this was an African-American, inner-city kid that grew up in a violent neighborhood to a single mother who is addicted to crack and he was caught two or three times ... what is the likelihood that the judge would excuse his behavior and let him off because of how he was raised?"
Authorities said the teen and friends were seen on surveillance video stealing two cases of beer from a store.
His truck slammed into the four pedestrians, killing Brian Jennings, 43, Breanna Mitchell, 24, Shelby Boyles, 21, and her mother, Hollie Boyles, 52.
Instead, the judge "fashioned a sentence that could have him under the thumb of the justice system for the next 10 years," he told the Star-Telegram.

District Judge Jean Boyd has not publicly explained the reason behind the decision to give Couch probation.
Psychologist Dr. Suniya Luthar said her research at Columbia University in New York has shown that 20 percent of upper middle-class teens believe their parents would help them get out of a sticky situation at school.
Authorities said the teen and friends were seen on video stealing two cases of beer from a store.
A bad case of "affluenza" may be keeping a wealthy Texas teen out of prison for a fatal drunk driving crash.
Luthar said there is one type of justice for the rich and another for the poor.
Instead, the judge "fashioned a sentence that could have him under the thumb of the justice system for the next 10 years," he said.
A Texas teen may have avoided being sent to prison for a drunk driving crash that killed four people because he suffered from having too much money.
He must also stay out of trouble for 10 years.
In other words, he suffered from "affluenza."
She said her research has shown that nearly a fourth of upper middle-class teens believe their parents would help them get out of a sticky situation at school.
Instead, the judge gave him a punishment that could keep him being under heavy supervision for the next 10 years, he said.
Donald Trump on Tuesday stood by his call to block all Muslims from entering the United States, even as the idea was widely condemned as un-American by rival Republican presidential candidates, party leaders and others.
He defended his plan for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" by comparing it with President Franklin Roosevelt\'s decision to intern Japanese-Americans during World War II.
The idea announced by Trump on Monday evening drew swift rebukes, some from abroad.
Muslims in the United States and around the world denounced the idea unconstitutional or offensive.
In morning TV interviews Tuesday on ABC and CNN, Trump was asked about being compared to Hitler.
In the late 1800s, Congress passed legislation broadly aimed at halting Chinese immigration.

For Europeans, their own dysfunctions makes sense; the European Union, after all, is made up of 28 nations with competing interests, while the eurozone, where the euro is the currency, is composed of 17 nations with differing economic needs and styles.
The impact of the standoff came through in a commentary distributed earlier this week by the official Chinese news agency Xinhua, in which the writer suggested that given the current crisis "it is perhaps a good time for the befuddled world to start considering building a de-Americanized world."
A German newspaper columnist this week asked why people here were shocked by the American government stalemate that led to the recent shutdown.
And Europe, troubled as it may be, remains a substantial economic force.
Earlier this year, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius gave a speech in Jakarta, Indonesia, encapsulating recent global history and the end of "The American Century."

While it was only one column in one newspaper, it did nicely sum up how much of the world seemed to be seeing the United States during the budget standoff:  both dysfunctional, like Greece, and authoritarian, like Germany.
No one was amused, however, because the United States, after all, is not a bit player on the international stage like Greece.

"By then everyone was kind of running," Dececco said in an interview moments after he and his daughter had scrambled up the rocky cliff above the cove for a better view.
In a state where tourism drives the economy, the uptick in shark encounters has alarmed visitors and business owners alike.
Like many longtime residents and fishermen here, Alesna offers myriad theories for the rise in shark attacks.
Turtles, for example, are just one part of the broad diet favored by tiger sharks, which are known as the "garbage cans" of the ocean.

"By then everyone was kind of running," Dececco said in an interview moments after he and his daughter had scrambled up the rocky cliff above the cove for a better view.

Later that day, they watched a spear fisherman haul in his catch as they strolled by the same spot at sunset.
"By then everyone was kind of running," Dececco said in an interview just moments after he and his daughter had scrambled up a rocky cliff for a better view.
The beach then remains shut until noon the next day, if officials on helicopter and jet ski patrols believe that the shark has left the vicinity.
For now, the government sees no need to change that policy.
Shark attacks increased in both 2013 and 2012.
In the three years before that, there were just three incidents per year.
But, so far, the large number of recent attacks does not appear to have affected tourism in Hawaii.
Tourism officials believe visitors to Hawaii realize that shark attacks are still very rare.
Sharks produce their babies during the winter months and attacks on humans are much more likely at that time.
"People that come from the mainland have no respect for anything, neither the ocean nor the land," Alesna said about the visitors to her island.
Like many longtime residents and fishermen here, Alesna offers lots of theories for the rise in shark attacks.
She thinks that sharks might be coming closer to the beach in search of green sea turtles to eat.
The turtle populations have recovered a bit in Hawaii.
These sharks are known as the "garbage cans" of the ocean because they will swallow anything and everything they find.
"Tiger sharks \u2014 you don\'t play with them," he warned.
Two people died after attacks in 2013 \u2014 a German snorkeler and a Washington state kayak fisherman.
Both incidents occurred in the waters near Makena State Park.
In the three years before that, there were just three incidents per year.
So his study will look at whether tiger sharks are more common in areas of Maui where those sports are most popular.

Later that day, they watched a fisherman haul in his catch at the same spot at sunset.
It was an 8-foot-long tiger shark, one of the fiercest shark species around.
The tiger shark is probably responsible for most of the 14 attacks on Hawaii in 2013.
Eight of those happened near Makena.
The fisherman let go of his net and took off running down the shore, shouting for swimmers to get out of the water.

This study will look at whether tiger sharks spend more time around Maui beaches than the other Hawaiian islands.
In the three years before that there were just three attacks a year.
But many swimmers are changing what they do because of the attacks.
Some visitors said they will now not swim very far out to sea because they are scared of the sharks.
People should also avoid cloudy water that attracts the predators.
Alesna said that the tourists have no respect for the ocean or the land.
He says that turtles are just one of many things tiger sharks will eat.
But the scientist does know that there are more people in the sea than ever before.
So he will now look at whether there are more tiger sharks where there are more fisherman, surfers and paddle boarders.
A Malaysian-born, British-educated accountant and former music executive, Fernandes teamed up with other investors to purchase a struggling Malaysian government-owned airline in 2001, paying the equivalent of about 25 cents.
Last year, Branson dressed up as a female flight attendant and served customers on the flight of an affiliate, AirAsia X, after losing a bet to Fernandes over a Formula One race.
"I always liked the idea of a low-cost airline, having gone to boarding school and wanted to go home more often, and the idea was always in my mind," he told Reuters news service in 2011.

It will not be easy to limit pollution from China, said scientist Owen Cooper.
Now, people are realizing that smog in a faraway country can affect us here.
People used to think Asian pollution would not affect us here, Faloona said.
They did not believe it could travel all the way across the Pacific Ocean.
The goal is to get a better idea of what happens to the human body on a prolonged mission, in preparation for an eventual journey to Mars.
"It\'s all about getting the astronaut there and back, healthy," said Basner, who is leading the Penn research with colleagues Ruben Gur and David Dinges.
Since the DNA of identical twins is very nearly the same, differences in their health may be attributed to different exposures \u2014 in this case, being in space vs. on the ground.
But the results from these pilot studies can be compared with those from astronauts on future long missions.
So Gur and his Penn colleagues have developed harder questions in a variety of areas, such as working memory, spatial orientation, and emotion recognition.
If the test battery is validated in future studies, it might be used to determine if an astronaut is alert enough to engage in a particularly challenging task, such as a space walk.
The Penn team says similar tests could be used for people in other high-stakes occupations, such as civilian or military pilots.
The conditions in an airplane cockpit are markedly different from those on the space station, but both are dangerous places to experience fatigue.
The 51-year-old Kelly twins have taken the cognitive tests several times here on Earth, and are scheduled to do so 11 times during the mission, which will launch aboard a Soyuz spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
Yet their exposures and experiences make them different in any number of subtle ways, even though they grew up in the same household and even pursued the same career as astronauts.
But they will contribute to the Mars mission nonetheless, in the form of test results from their immune systems, their bacteria, and their brains.

Scientists have not had much luck learning about this problem with their usual tests, so now they are trying something new.
Mark will take all the same tests, but he will stay behind on Earth the whole time.
Basner thinks the tests might even help other people with risky jobs, like pilots.
Their test results will help scientists learn how to keep the Mars astronauts safe and ensure their mission is a success.
Weightlessness can also become a problem for astronauts.

It will give them information to compare with test results from future missions.
The University of Pennsylvania team plans to share their work with the other scientists studying the Kelly twins.
It has lots of information about astronauts who have spent six months in space.
Astronauts can suffer from all sorts of health issues while they are in space.
They will take them 11 times during the mission and three more times after Scott Kelly lands.
A Mars trip is still many years away.
Their test results will help keep the Mars astronauts safe and make sure their mission is a success.
As Jeff King attempts to hold off other mushers in the last stages of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, the town famous for the finish line is getting ready for the teams to come in.
The finish line banner was set to be hung Monday morning on Front Street in Nome with help from the local electric utility.
Zirkle, a 44-year-old musher from Two Rivers, Alaska, led hours before when she arrived at the Norton Bay village of Koyuk one minute ahead of King on Sunday afternoon.
King departed Koyuk at 5:50 p.m. and arrived in Elim at 11:27 p.m., while Zirkle got back on the trail at 5:51 p.m. and made it into Elim at 11:47 p.m., race officials said.
Snowfall has been light this winter in the frontier town of nearly 3,700, so the city has been stockpiling snow, which was being trucked to Front Street for the final stretch to the finish line.
She attended the start of the race last year in Anchorage, fell in love with the event and decided she needed to see the finish in person, too.
"Any dogs that can laugh when they run, with their tongues hanging out, they got my heart right now," said Cross, who just learned about the volunteer programs and already is making plans to be back in Nome next year.
King rested his 12-dog team at the checkpoint for three hours and 42 minutes, while Zirkle and her 11 dogs took a break for three hours and 44 minutes.

King, a four-time champion, was leading Aliy Zirkle by 20 minutes as the two arrived at the Elim checkpoint shortly before midnight Sunday.
Zirkle, a 44-year-old musher from Two Rivers, Alaska, led hours before when she arrived at the Norton Bay village of Koyuk one minute ahead of King on Sunday afternoon.
King last won in 2006 and is trying to be only the second musher to win five races.
She is seeking to become only the third woman to win the race, and the first woman to win since the late Susan Butcher in 1990.
The race began March 2 in Willow with 69 teams.

Snowfall has been light this winter in the frontier town of nearly 3,700, so the city has been stockpiling snow.
Serum is a form of medicine.
In 1925, it was being used to treat the contagious infection diphtheria.
The race began March 2 in Willow, near Anchorage, with 69 teams.
Long stretches of bare and rocky ground made for an icy, treacherous trail in the early part of the race.
She is seeking to become only the third woman to win the race.
And she would be the first woman to win since the late Susan Butcher in 1990.
Bill McCormick of Greensboro, N.C., volunteered for his first Iditarod in 1998.

The 80-year-old South Carolina artist says he hopes the works, which some may see as divisive, spark thoughtful reactions and help people understand their shared history, even for those outside the South.
Jovial and chatty at his Orangeburg studio, Twiggs said he is enjoying his best year as an artist.
Sandy Rupp, owner of the Hampton III Gallery in Taylors, said Twiggs has been exploring flag images since the 1970s.
He makes it his flag, and gives it his power."
In several, the outlines of brown figures float in the background.
A black cow stands watch in some, recalling an animal Twiggs cared for as a child, growing up in segregated St. Stephens.
But once the nation came under attack in the Sept. 11 terror strikes, Twiggs said he realized the images also meant that "we are all targeted, we all have things to fear."
Many of his artworks make use of the Confederate flag \u2014 the flag of the rebel South during the Civil War.
Others feature faceless men with bulls-eyes on their backs.
The flags are rendered in red, white, or blue and smudged with brown or blood-red splotches.

Irene Granados celebrated her 16th birthday while walking through the desert two years ago trying to reach the United States \u2014 and safety.
The cases involving Granados from El Salvador and the Giron brothers from Honduras are among the first of recent arrivals to surface in South Florida.
When pressed for details, Granados said gang members were threatening to steal her belongings as pressure for her to join.
She said her mother and other relatives told her the best thing to do was to flee to the United States, where she had an aunt living in Lake Worth in Palm Beach County.
The officers detained the teens and took them to a detention center near the border.
Irene Granados celebrated her 16th birthday while walking through the desert two years ago trying to reach the United States \u2014 and safety.
They traveled in a car with a guide and five other teens ranging in age from 13 to 16.

But in 2012, police caught 13,000.
Still, it will be awhile before any kind of new weight loss drug or treatment is made available.
Another test in the lab edited out the problem gene in human cells.
They think it probably has less of an effect than having two copies.
Several companies are trying to develop treatments to encourage the growth of calorie-burning brown fat.
He called the work "an amazing study" and "a scientific tour de force."
Being overweight is a serious problem for many people.
Scientists can now start working on a drug to help lower obesity.
The gene was found in nearly half of all Europeans tested.
However, it was found in only a very small number of black people.
They weighed an average of 7 pounds more than people without two copies.
Later in the day, Carlsbad officials said that eight homes, an eight-unit apartment building and two commercial buildings were destroyed or damaged.
Instead, a fire erupted there and blanketed his neighborhood with smoke.
"It\'s like a scene from Armageddon," one homeowner said of the region as thick, black smoke blotted out the sun in some areas.
On Wednesday, brush fires broke out in more than half a dozen spots in northern San Diego County.
People in San Diego County, state official Dave Jones said, "are all too familiar with the destructive force of wildfires."
"It\'s been a bad day," he said.
Several elementary schools and libraries were emptied out as well.
The fast-food protests were planned by organizers at more than 270 cities nationwide, part of an ongoing campaign called "Fight for $15."
Janitors, nursing home workers and package delivery workers also joined some protests, organizers said.
The campaign began about three years ago and is funded by the Service Employees International Union, which represents low-wage workers.
This time workers are pledging not to vote for presidential candidates who do not support the campaign.
Janitors, nursing home workers and package delivery workers also joined some protests, organizers said.
The protests were part of an ongoing campaign called "Fight for $15."
The larger goal of that campaign is to get the nationwide minimum wage raised to $15 an hour for all low-wage employees.

I want these guys here to show the world, and speak about North Korea in a great light," Rodman said.
Rodman is the highest-profile American to meet Kim since the leader inherited power after his father, Kim Jong Il, died in late 2011.
The former NBA players, who arrived in Pyongyang on Monday, also include Eric "Sleepy" Floyd, Doug Christie and Charles D. Smith, who played for the New York Knicks.
Four streetballers are also on the squad.
"The marshal is actually trying to change this country in a great way," Rodman said of Kim, using the leader\'s official title.
Americans are regarded as enemies in North Korea.
Thousands of U.S. troops are still based in South Korea, and the Demilitarized Zone between the North and South is one of the most heavily armed borders in the world.
Dennis Rodman is giving a "birthday present" to one of his most unlikely fans: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
The former NBA players, who arrived in Pyongyang on Monday, also include Eric "Sleepy" Floyd, Doug Christie and Charles D. Smith, who played for the New York Knicks.
Instead, he said, he sees the game as a "birthday present" for Kim and his country.
Rodman came back just before Christmas to hold tryouts for the North Korean basketball team, though he did not meet with Kim then.
To keep the game itself friendly, the two sides will only play against each other in the first half, and then mix together in the second.
Bae is an American missionary with health problems who is being held in North Korea on charges of committing "anti-state" crimes.
"The team is made up of a lot of guys who really care, that\'s the most important, it\'s not about bringing dream-teamers.
But North Korean officials say the execution settled the issue and there is no instability.
The Hall of Fame basketball player has been given the red-carpet treatment on each of his trips.
"It\'s new being here," but the idea of such a game isn\'t, he said.
Dennis Rodman arrived in the North Korean capital Monday.
Other players also include Eric "Sleepy" Floyd, Doug Christie and Charles D. Smith, who played for the New York Knicks.
Rodman told The Associated Press he was glad to be in North Korea for the game.
Rodman has also been slammed for not trying to use his friendship with Kim to get Kenneth Bae released.

United Nations officials are pushing for many of the Central Americans fleeing to the United States to be treated as refugees displaced by armed conflict, a designation meant to increase pressure on the United States and Mexico to accept tens of thousands of people currently ineligible for asylum.
While such a resolution would lack any legal weight, the agency said it believes "the U.S. and Mexico should recognize that this is a refugee situation, which implies that they shouldn\'t be automatically sent to their home countries but rather receive international protection."
Most of the people widely considered to be refugees by the international community are fleeing more traditional political or ethnic conflicts like those in Syria or Sudan.
Central Americans would be among the first modern migrants considered refugees because they are fleeing violence and extortion at the hands of criminal gangs.
Immigration experts in the United States and Central America say the flow of migrants from Honduras and El Salvador is likely to rise as the two countries experience more gang-related violence.
Those actions could include emergency aid and social services for internally displaced people inside Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Many congressional Republicans attribute the increased immigration to a failure to secure the border and recent immigration policy changes that led many to believe child migrants would be allowed to stay.
"Unaccompanied children and families who fear for their lives and freedoms must not be forcibly returned without access to proper asylum procedures," UNHCR official Leslie Velez said in testimony submitted to the House Judiciary Committee late last month.

On Thursday, migration and interior department representatives from the United States, Mexico and Central America will meet in Nicaragua.
Large areas of all three countries are under the control of drug traffickers and street gangs who routinely rob and rape ordinary citizens.
Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said migrants from his country were "displaced by war."
Weak and corrupt police forces in those countries were quickly overwhelmed.
At least 135,000 people have been forced to leave their homes, the vast majority due to gang violence.
Immigration experts say the flow of migrants from Honduras and El Salvador is likely to rise as the two countries experience more gang-related violence.
However, a broad-based change in terminology could bring pressure on the two countries to do more.

The United Nations, an international organization that promotes peace and cooperation between countries, is pushing for a new way to define many of the Central Americans, particularly children, who have been coming into the United States.
Typically, they are fleeing wars or persecution.
The real danger they are in is considered to be a strong reason for granting them asylum, or protection by a nation such as the United States.
It would encourage both countries to accept tens of thousands of people who cannot currently be considered for asylum.

The United Nations, or U.N., was founded in 1945 to help bring about peace and cooperation among countries.
However, its suggestions and opinions are taken very seriously.

The Obama administration is developing additional screening protocols for airline passengers both overseas and in the United States to control infectious diseases such as Ebola, President Barack Obama said Monday.
At a televised news conference to announce his new 17-member task force to deal with infectious diseases, Perry said federal officials should tighten screening procedures at all U.S. points of entry.
When his condition worsened on Sept. 28, he was rushed back to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, where he was in isolation in critical condition.
Meanwhile, a freelance journalist who had been working for NBC News arrived in Omaha, Nebraska, to be treated for Ebola, which he contracted in Liberia.
Ashoka Mukpo was taken to the Nebraska Medical Center, where he will be kept in isolation.
Mukpo was able to walk off the plane on his own Monday before being loaded onto a stretcher for the ambulance ride to the hospital, his father, Dr. Mitchell Levy, said at a televised news conference.
It was not known how Mukpo became infected, but Levy said it may have happened when his son helped clean a vehicle in which someone had died.

The deadly Ebola virus has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa.
President Barack Obama announced Monday that the government is creating more rules for airplane passengers.
However, last month a man named Thomas Eric Duncan traveled from the African country of Liberia to the United States.
When he became sicker three days later, he was rushed back to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas.
He was in isolation at the hospital and extremely ill. Because doctors did not realize Duncan had Ebola, many are afraid the disease could have spread.
Forty-eight people are being closely watched for signs of Ebola.
Ten of those people are "high risk" because they were near Duncan when he was sick.
Health officials cleaned out the apartment where Duncan was living.
New rules could be announced shortly, an official said.
Delayed by a sniper attack, United Nations chemical weapons inspectors arrived Monday in one of the Syrian suburbs allegedly hit in a poison gas attack last week, visiting a pair of field hospitals and meeting with witnesses, the U.N. said.

The booming illegal international wildlife trade forced conservationists to do the unthinkable Tuesday: Brand the golden domes of two of the rarest tortoises on Earth to reduce their black market value by making it easier for authorities to trace them if stolen.
"We\'ve blemished her natural beauty, so she\'s just a number in a system now," Gibbons said.

"They didn\'t even stop pounding nails," said Tracy Drury, an environmental engineer and applied geomorphologist who assessed the area with Miller soon after the landslide.
But they were not there on Saturday when the mudslide wiped out the mobile home and swept away neighbors who are now missing and presumed dead.
Shannon concluded that a main cause of the slides is the river eroding the "toe" of a previous slide, which supports the millions of tons of dirt behind it, like someone with their back against a bulging door.
"I think we did the best that we could under the constraints that nobody wanted to sell their property and move," Drury said.
Stevenson said county officials who approved development seemed more focused on whether the homes were in flood areas than on the risk of a landslide.

"We\'ve known it would happen at some point," he told The Seattle Times on Monday.
But he said it was "an unrealistic expectation" for people to think the government could prevent such disasters.

Another home was built in the neighborhood in 2009.
"We\'ve known it would happen at some point," said Daniel Miller, a geomorphologist who studies how landscapes form and tries to predict their changes.
They all tell the story of an unstable hillside that has defied efforts to shore it up.
Snohomish County Executive John Lovick and Public Works Director Steve Thomsen said Monday night that they were not aware of the 1999 report.
According to the report, a main cause of the slides is the river eroding, or slowly washing away, the "toe" left behind by a previous slide.
"We always thought there was a possibility that a catastrophic event could come," said Pat Stevenson, the environmental manager of the Stillaguamish Tribe, a local Native American tribe.
"I think we did the best that we could" given the reality "that nobody wanted to sell their property and move," Drury said.

The swimming-pool-size shaft, 18 feet wide by 38 feet long, is yielding evidence from its depths of a cooler, wetter Pleistocene climate of 100,000 to 330,000 years ago, when Pacific Ocean waves lapped over what is now the bustling Miracle Mile.
Below that is "near shore" material from 100,000 to at least 330,000 years old, Scott said.
In one spectacular instance, a worker scraped his bulldozer across what turned out to be a nearly intact skeleton of a Columbian mammoth with 10-foot-long tusks, which researchers named Zed.
Scientists reveled in the find, given that previous discoveries in the tar pits had included only bits and pieces of mammoths.
After identifying the edges of each of 16 deposits, they dug around and underneath them, wrapped them in heavy plastic, built wooden crates around them and lifted them out with a heavy crane.
Above the fresh muck, wood and shotcrete had been installed to hold back the soil.
Bethany Ader, another Cogstone paleontologist, scrambled up and down a slippery slope of tar sand carrying small relics.
Paleontologists have recovered mollusks, asphalt-saturated sand dollars, pieces of driftwood and Monterey cypress cones.
Materials from the upper 40 feet of the shaft range from modern era to 50,000 years old.
"Even though we\'re finding fossils older than what\'s found at La Brea, none of the identified fossils found to date are extinct," Scott said.

Back then, Pacific Ocean waves lapped over what is now the bustling Miracle Mile stretch of Wilshire Boulevard.
Materials from the upper 40 feet of the shaft range from the modern era to 50,000 years old.
The exploratory shaft now being dug will be twice as deep as any other previous excavation in the area.
At this stage, the marine finds are quite portable: geoducks, clams, snails, mussels, tusk shells.

In a major shift in immigration patterns over the next 50 years, Asians will have surged past Hispanics to become the largest group of immigrants heading to the United States, according to estimates in a new immigration study.
Today, immigrants make up 14 percent of the population, an increase from 5 percent in 1965.
White immigrants to America, 80 percent back in 1965, will hover somewhere between 18 and 20 percent with black immigrants in the 8 percent to 9 percent range, the study said.
"There are relatively fewer people who would choose to migrate from Mexico so demographic changes in Mexico have led to a somewhat smaller pool of potential migrants," he said.
Forty-nine percent offered general descriptions, and of those, 12 percent were positive, 11 percent negative and 26 percent neutral, according to the report.

Researchers say Asians will have surged past Hispanics to become the largest group of immigrants heading to the United States.
Today, immigrants make up 14 percent of the U.S. population, an increase from 5 percent in 1965.
The actual change is expected to come in 2055, when Asians will become the largest immigrant group at 36 percent, compared with Hispanics at 34 percent.
Part of the reason for the shift is that the fertility rate of women in Latin America and especially Mexico has decreased.

Trauma surgeon Albert Chi gave a talk last year to families about advanced prosthetics that would someday benefit their children who were missing hands.
The organization has provided more than 400 children with printed prosthetics over the past year.
Griffin Matuszek, who was born without part of his left hand, found his traditional prosthetic mostly useless and a bit scary, said his mother, Quinn Cassidy.
The traditional prosthetic was tight and covered his forearm.
I can go kayaking and work on my cars now," said Waldron, who said an electronic prosthetic device could cost as much as $40,000, while the one he received at Hopkins was in the $45 range.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 4 in 10,000 children are born with some congenital hand loss, or about 1,500 a year.
Griffin Matuszek, who was born without part of his left hand, found his traditional prosthetic mostly useless and a bit scary, said his mother, Quinn Cassidy.
Richard Van As, a South African, was a carpenter who accidentally severed some fingers.
Then a local mother asked for a prosthetic hand for her 5-year-old son, so they made him one too.
Trauma surgeon Albert Chi gave a talk last year to families about advanced prosthetics that would someday benefit their children who were missing hands.
They eventually replaced the hands with better 3-D printed versions they called Robohands.
"It\'s a powerful experience watching someone use a new hand."
Trauma surgeon Albert Chi gave a talk last year to families about advanced prosthetics that would someday benefit their children who were missing hands.
"One of the first kids we fitted was a 2-year-old," Chi, a surgeon, said.
The 3-D printed versions are particularly useful for children, who often grow out of their artificial hands and cannot afford replacements every few months or years.
The 3-D versions also can be lighter and easier to use, and come in their favorite colors.
Griffin Matuszek, 5, who was born without part of his left hand, found his traditional prosthetic mostly useless and a bit scary, said his mother, Quinn Cassidy.
In 2011, Richard Van As, a South African carpenter, accidentally lost some fingers.
A mother then asked for a prosthetic hand for her 5-year-old son, so As and Owen made him one too.
When a parent asked Dr. Albert Chi about easy, available and affordable artificial hands for children, he was stumped.
Griffin, who requested a glow-in-the-dark hand, liked his new limb because he could put it on himself and it was easy to use.
To make an artificial hand, plastic sheets are fed into the machines and melted.

The price of oil has fallen by nearly half in just six months, a surprising and steep plunge.
They are now pumping 3.5 million more barrels of oil per day.
"An extra 20 or 30 bucks in my pocket goes far," he said.
For oil companies, oil-producing states, and oil-exporting countries, the oil price collapse is painful.
Some have already had to cut their spending.
They are now pumping 3.5 million more barrels of oil per day.
They work together to decide how much oil to produce and sell.
Even in the United States, demand for oil and gasoline is not increasing.
"Any time gas prices go down that is a good thing," said 30-year-old Randy Daniels.
He was shopping recently at a mall in Atlanta, Georgia.
A barrel of oil now costs about $58.
Last summer it cost $107.
They are now pumping 3.5 million more barrels of oil each day.
The group of 12 nations plans to keep pumping oil steadily.
Countries that export a lot of oil such as Iran, Iraq, Russia and Venezuela rely on money from oil.
If prices stay this low, the country could lose $36 billion.

"The (big) hotel is the main thing.
The ruined hotel, built as a joint effort between the Austrian and Pakistani governments, welcomed visitors with a white modernist facade and sweeping concave roof, a departure from the boxy style typical of most Pakistani architecture.
"Swat is now totally cleared of the Taliban," said Syed Aqil Shah, tourism minister for Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, where Swat is located.
For all its drawbacks, the resort is still a salve for residents who long ago fell in love with skiing and have nothing else to fill their day.
"The government has been telling us for years that they\'re going to rebuild the hotel, and it never happens," said Sabz Ali, 18, trudging up the slope with his Japanese-made skis over his shoulder.
His family owns a small hotel nearby called the Green View, which pulls in about $20 a month, on average, from a smattering of guests.
Skiers taking a break from the slope could skate at the ice rink or browse through a souvenir shop devoted solely to jars of Swat-made honey.
The Swat Valley region now attracts about 50,000 tourists annually, compared with 300,000 before the Taliban takeover, said Zahid Khan, president of the All-Swat Hotels Association.
His requests to meet with top officials are largely ignored, he said, along with pleas for financial assistance.
Making matters worse, the region was hit by the epic floods that washed over a swath of Pakistan in 2010.
Many scrape by on whatever money they can earn teaching skiers or renting out their own equipment to the few visitors who arrive at Malam Jabba daily.

Plans to auction a rare permit that will allow a hunter to take down an endangered black rhino are drawing criticism from some conservationists, but the organizer says the fundraiser could bring in more than $1 million that would go toward protecting the species.
"More than ridiculous," Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States, said Wednesday.
You\'re going to help an [endangered animal](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) by killing an endangered member of that population?"
Earlier this year, the service granted such a permit for a sport-hunted black rhino taken in Namibia in 2009.
There was no response Wednesday to an email from The Associated Press.
"The two hot issues here are the fact it\'s an endangered species, and the second thing is it\'s a trophy," Barongi, the zoo director, said.
Plans to auction a rare permit that will allow a hunter to take down an endangered black rhino are drawing criticism from some conservationists, but the organizer says the fundraiser could bring in more than $1 million that would go toward protecting the species.
Organizers of an auction expect to raise more than $1 million to help protect the endangered black rhino.
Animal conservationists around the world are joining together to protect the elephant and rhino from people with high-powered weapons, he said.
He is a member of the safari club and a Louisiana-based international wildlife lawyer.
The rhino permit auction "is not something the (regular person) understands, but they should," Jackson said.
He called it the best way to preserve the endangered species.
Nearly 1,800 of the rhinos are in Namibia, located in southwestern Africa, said the safari club.
Killing an older, violent rhino means that more rhino calves will be born, he said.
Flocken is the North American regional director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare.
Flocken called the auction "totally irresponsible."

Wildlife advocates are concerned that without forceful global action, elephants and rhinos face [extinction](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species).
Under the new strategy, if someone is caught trying to sell ivory items, the government will confiscate them unless sellers can provide documentation that they are legal.
Sales within states will also be prohibited unless sellers can show they were brought into the U.S. before laws barring their import were put into effect.
Late last year, U.S. officials destroyed more than 6 tons of confiscated ivory tusks, carvings and jewelry.
U.S. demand for wildlife products is surpassed only by China, where the market price for ivory is more than $1,000 a pound and has increased significantly, according to the World Wildlife Fund.
While unveiling the strategy, the Obama administration also called on Congress to pass new laws to further crack down on the trafficking.
The United States is cracking down on the sale and purchase of ivory in hopes of curbing a surge in illegal poaching.
The ivory ban is a key part of a new, national strategy for combating wildlife trafficking, unveiled on Tuesday by the White House.

That means someone who placed an ivory chess set for sale on eBay, for example, faced little risk of being investigated by law enforcement.
Ashe said that the legal trade provides a "smoke screen" for the illegal ivory sales.
He said it also makes it more difficult for police to find the banned goods, as well as catch and prosecute the criminals.
Last week, France followed suit by crushing more than three tons of illegal ivory.
Other nations including Gabon and China have also taken similar steps.

Less than one-third of people who tried to get revenge found that helpful.
The poll also indicated that young people are becoming more aware what cyberbullying can do.
People who think it should be accepted as a part of life declined from 33 percent to 24 percent.
Since then, Evan has started a series of businesses, including a power-washing and deck-refinishing service and buying electronic devices in bulk and reselling them on Amazon.com.
Evan has taught himself the financial and legal aspects, as well as the technical angle.
Bitcoins are also accepted as payment by businesses such as Overstock.com and online game company Zynga.
Miners, said Harvey, who has proposed teaching about bitcoins next school year, "are sealing off this vault with a computer program."
Many miners, including Evan, join online pools of miners who combine their digital resources and share in the rewards.
Evan admits that the ever-rising cost of hardware may end up pricing him out of the bitcoin mining business.
However, he soon discovered that if he wanted to make money at it, he would need more computer horsepower.
Digital currencies are worthless if they can be copied, which is where mining comes in.
Miners who solve a difficult mathematical puzzle and create the vault first are rewarded with newly created bitcoins.
Currently, 25 bitcoins are handed out as rewards about every 10 minutes.
Evan estimates he has mined about 4.5 bitcoins so far.

Evan Neal is definitely not your average 16-year-old.
Bitcoin miners \u2014 as people like Evan are called \u2014 earn bitcoins by using special computer software to solve complicated math problems.
Neal is impressed by how much his son has learned about bitcoin.
"He\'s 16, but it feels to me he is pretty much an expert in the field," Dave Neal said.
Because names are kept secret, criminals and drug dealers have used bitcoin.

The government estimates that another 740 million of its citizens are exposed to second-hand smoke and more than 1 million people in the country die from smoking-related diseases each year.
The Chinese government recently passed laws to cut down on smoking in the capital city of Beijing.
Beijing began efforts to limit smoking in 2008.
Back then, there were harsh fines for businesses that did not follow the rules.
Fines for individuals who smoked in non-smoking areas were only about $1.40.
Outing lawbreaking smokers online may not sound like a big deal.
These displays of shame are one of the many ways the government pushes people to follow its rules.
Now officials are using the tactic to try to reduce smoking.

The skeletal remains of an infant who lived in what is now Montana about 12,600 years ago will be reburied in a formal ceremony now that scientists have sequenced its genome, researchers say.
However, a competing proposal \u2014 the Solutrean hypothesis \u2014 held that they were actually descended from people who had emigrated from southwestern Europe.
The new research argued strongly against that possibility, scientists said.
The study does not support the idea that the first Americans originated from Europe, as proposed by the Solutrean hypothesis," said study co-author Michael Waters, an archaeologist at Texas A&amp;M University.
"These genetic findings are consistent with the archaeological evidence that shows the American continent was first explored and settled around 15,000 years ago, with Clovis emerging 2,000 years later."
"They showed a lot of interest in the study, but all of them said that now is the time for the skeleton to go back into the ground," Willerslev told a documentary film crew.
The Clovis culture is so named because its first remnants were found in 1932 in Clovis, N.M. To archaeologists, the culture is characterized by the distinctive fluted stone spear points it left behind.
"I feel like this discovery basically confirms what tribes have really never doubted, that we\'ve been here since time immemorial, and that all the artifacts, objects in the ground are remnants of our direct ancestors," Doyle said.

The difference in age, Waters said, suggested the antler tools were ritual or heirloom objects that had been kept for generations.
At the request of several Native American tribes, an ancient human skeleton will soon be reburied in a formal ceremony.
The bones were accidentally discovered in Western Montana by a construction worker in 1968.
Scientists believe the powdered mineral was probably used during a burial ceremony.
The National Mall is the stretch of parks, museums and memorials that extends from the Lincoln Memorial to the U.S. Capitol building.
It is sometimes known as "the nation\'s front lawn" for its green open spaces and position next to some of the country\'s most important government buildings.
At ground level, all that visitors viewing the installation can see are swirls of alternating lines of dirt and sand with a few patches of gravel.

To keep pesky birds away from his blueberries, veteran farmer Mark Flamm has blared recordings of avian distress calls, shot noisy "bird bangers" from a pistol and ordered an employee to shake a gravel-filled bottle at the sky.
"That didn\'t work," said Flamm, 58, who once lost a fifth of his berries to his feathered foe despite the efforts, "though I got a picture of a bird sitting on the scarecrow."
Suddenly all the other birds go quiet because they know they could be eaten," said Flamm, who has seen his crop loss from birds dwindle to around 3 percent.
"There\'s not much we can do," said Joe MacIlvaine, president of Paramount Farming Co. in Bakersfield, Calif., the world\'s largest grower and processor of almonds and pistachios.

If you ever wondered how fattening that supersized soft drink or box of popcorn is, in about a year, food sellers will have to tell you.
Included in the guidelines will be large chain restaurants, amusement parks and movie theaters.
Even supermarkets and convenience stores that serve prepared dishes must disclose how many calories they contain.
The additional information would include things like sodium, sugar, fat and cholesterol content.
The new guidelines were required by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which expanded health care coverage in the United States.
The new rules were made public Tuesday in the Federal Register, which publishes government documents.
Americans spend nearly half their food money on food bought outside the home.
Two-thirds of adults and one-third of children in the United States are either overweight or obese.
By mandating the nutritional information, "consumers will have the information they need to make healthier, more educated decisions about their food choices when eating outside the home," he said.
In the years since, state and local governments created their own labeling requirements, which were inconsistent.
The new FDA rules "will help avoid situations in which a chain restaurant subject to the federal requirements has to meet different requirements in different states," the FDA wrote in a statement.
Larkin wrote the association is "disappointed" that the FDA\'s final rules includes grocery stories.
If you ever wondered how fattening that supersized soft drink or box of popcorn is, in about a year, food sellers will have to tell you.
They will take effect on Dec. 1, 2015.
In 1990, the federal Nutrition Labeling and Education Act required nutrition information be provided on most foods.
The FDA estimates the vending machine rules will cost operators $37.9 million over the next 20 years.
She said she appreciates that the vending machine industry is being given a longer period to post the signs.

The sardine fishing boat Eileen motored slowly through moonlit waters from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island, its weary-eyed captain growing more desperate as the night wore on.
To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast.
One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast.
"We shouldn\'t be harvesting sardines any time the population is this low," said Geoff Shester, California program director for the conservation group Oceana, which contends that continuing to fish for them could speed their decline and arrest any recovery.
By mid-century sardines had practically vanished, and in the 1960s California established a moratorium on sardine fishing that lasted 18 years.
The following year their pups showed up on the coast in overwhelming numbers, stranded and emaciated.
The seabirds, which scoop up sardines close to the ocean surface, have shown signs of starvation and have largely failed to breed or rear chicks there since 2010.
Still, when he embarked for Catalina Island on a December evening, Hanson tried to stay optimistic.
By daybreak, Hanson was piloting the hulking boat back to the docks with nothing in its holds.

Brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that depend on the oily, energy-rich fish for food could be starving.
Those conditions have brought a boom in some species, but have repelled sardines.
Separate sardine populations off Japan, Peru and Chile have risen and fallen in the same 50- to 70-year climate cycle, but have been more heavily exploited.
The following year, their pups showed up on the coast in overwhelming numbers, stranded and underweight.

The program was started in the early 1990s for children who were identified by their teachers and parents to be at high risk for developing aggressive behavioral problems.
The students were randomly put into two groups.
The program, which lasted from first grade through 10th grade, reduced delinquency, arrests and use of health and mental health services as the students aged through adolescence and young adulthood, as researchers explained in a separate study published earlier this year.
The researchers found that about a third of the impact on future crime outcomes was due to the social and self-regulation skills the students learned from ages 6 to 11.
The academic skills that were taught as part of Fast Track turned out to have less of an impact on crime and delinquency rates than did the soft skills.
Soft skills might include teaching kids to work cooperatively in a group or teaching them how to think about the long-term consequences when they make a decision.
Teaching physics or math is an example of a hard skill.
"The conclusion that we would make is that these (soft) skills should be emphasized even more in our education system and in our system of socializing children," says Kenneth Dodge, a professor of public policy and of psychology and neuroscience at Duke.
He was a principal investigator in this study as well as in the original Fast Track project.
"To the extent we can improve those skills, we can improve outcomes in delinquency and juvenile crime," says Dodge, who is also director of Duke\'s Center for Child and Family Policy.
Bernstein is also the author of multiple books, including "How to Keep Your Teenager Out of Trouble and What to Do if You Can\'t."
"There\'s a growing and new understanding of what it takes to be successful as an adolescent and an adult," Dodge says.

He was a principal investigator in this study as well as in the original Fast Track project.
Parents should do all they can to promote these skills with their children, Dodge says, as should education policymakers.
And while he says he agrees with the importance of teaching self-control and social skills, he would add empathy to the list, too.

For Sophia Pellar, a pair of special earplugs has put an end to the pain she suffered when playing flute in the high school pep band.
"But the thought of wearing them every day is a little embarrassing."
Research indicates that as many as 1 in 5 teens suffers from hearing loss, much of it caused by noise damage.
The next generation of music educators now being trained at colleges and universities are learning that their future lesson plans should convey the importance of students protecting their hearing during rehearsals and performances.
Still, officials say that even the most vigilant parents typically are unaware of the need for their children to take precautions.
"We\'re seeing a rise in the number of adolescents with hearing loss, which is not a surprise when you look at our society, which has gotten busier, nosier and overstimulated," said Dr. Henry Ou.
The National Association for Music Education urges teachers and band directors to address the dangers of noise-induced hearing loss during classes and rehearsals.
He even keeps a large jar in the band room stocked with the standard-style foam earplugs for his students.
Officials there said the reluctance of some teens and adults to be seen wearing earplugs helped inspire its recent debut of newly designed earplugs that are smaller and more discreet.
"The kids know I\'m not the least bit shy about it ...

"I had never thought of it at all ... and she has been playing the flute since she was in fourth grade," said Pellar, a physician.
They suggest, for example, ensuring that students are not performing at high volume levels for an extended time.
They need to do this both during rehearsals and performances and outside of the band program, too, Karon said.

Sophia Pellar used to have pain in her ears when she played flute in her high school pep band.
Still, the Mozart-loving New Trier High School sophomore giggles nervously when she explains that the earplugs have yet to become part of her regular routine.
Yet experts say their messages are not working as well as they can because people think it is "uncool" to wear earplugs.
She said she became alarmed recently when she learned that Sophia is often in pain after playing her flute in close ranks with her fellow musicians.
The result is hearing damage that builds up over time and is irreversible.

Craig Packer, director of the Lion Research Center at the University of Minnesota, has led a series of studies identifying over-hunting as the major reason for the steep decline in lion populations in Tanzania, the biggest lion-hunting country in Africa.
At the root of the problem, he believes, is the preference of trophy hunters for large male lions, the dominant animals in a pride.
In Tanzania, Packer said, the big, older trophy males became so depleted that hunters started killing immature maneless lions.
It\'s a very efficient way to promote the social instability that will cause a population to decline," he said in a telephone interview.
In instances where you have widespread corruption and regulations are not adhered to, it just becomes a killing frenzy and that\'s what\'s happening in Zimbabwe."
In Kenya, where hunting was banned in 1977, the lion population has dropped from 15,000 to about 2,000 in 15 years, a statistic often cited by the hunting industry to demonstrate that hunting is not the problem.
Critics contend that trophy hunting brings little economic benefit to local communities.
"We see that across Africa, local communities receive minimal benefit from trophy hunting, particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy," the report said.
The male lions might also kill off the cubs and attack females who try to defend them.
A 2013 study by Economists at Large, an Australian organization of conservation-minded economists, found that on average only 3 percent of money generated by trophy hunting winds up in the hands of local people.
After the global uproar over the death of a Zimbabwean lion called Cecil, the hunting industry responded.
Yet some research suggests an alternative theory: Hunting has hidden consequences that take a far greater toll on lion populations than people realize.
At the root of the problem, he believes, is the preference of trophy hunters for large male lions.
From 2002 to 2009, 1,363 lion trophies were exported from Tanzania.
In Kenya, where hunting was banned in 1977, the lion population has dropped from 15,000 to about 2,000 in 15 years.
Nearly 70 percent are bred in captivity, often used as cubs in petting zoos.

In the grim parlor game of "choose your poison," Floridians debate with their tornado-weary friends and family about which disaster they\'d rather have.
And yet studies have found \u2014 even with the start of hurricane season looming June 1 \u2014 that as many as two in three Florida residents say they have no plan for what they will do if a tropical system threatens.
Preparation helped only a little for Moore, Oklahoma, on Monday.

Hurricanes can be hundreds of miles across and can plow across thousands of miles for days before they fizzle.
That means even minor inconveniences such as power outages often cover a vastly larger area.
Damage at 111 mph is 21 times what it would be at 75 mph, a minimum-strength hurricane, according to a chart prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
But the storm pounded that area for two days, and those hours of wind did as much damage as a stronger, shorter storm.
Heavy rains: A slow-moving storm can produce considerably more rainfall than a swifter, stronger one.
And small storms can produce tornadoes as often as large ones.

The vast majority of visitors are domestic tourists, so to introduce the splendor of the grottoes to a wider international audience, the Getty Museum in Los Angeles will host a major exhibition on the complex starting in May 2016.
But the 25-year partnership with Dunhuang Academy is the institution\'s longest-running project, and its efforts in China represent "some of the best work we\'ve ever done in the field," said Tim Whalen, director of the Getty Conservation Institute.
These are questions facing World Heritage Sites everywhere \u2014 how do you preserve them and still ensure access for the public and scholars?
But there are not a lot of organizations investing in research that finds answers to these questions."
According to Wang Xudong, deputy director of the Dunhuang Academy, the research with Getty on visitor capacity indicated that as it was, the Mogao site could handle just 3,000 tourists per day \u2014 a number that seemed unrealistically low given the growing interest in the grottoes.
But the 25-year partnership with Dunhuang Academy is the institution\'s longest-running project, and its efforts in China represent "some of the best work we\'ve ever done in the field," said Tim Whalen, director of the Getty Conservation Institute.

In order to introduce the caves to a wider international audience, the Getty Museum in Los Angeles will host a major exhibition on the complex starting in May 2016.
Since the Getty Conservation Institute was founded in 1985, its researchers have worked on many high-profile World Heritage Sites, including the Tomb of Queen Nefertari and the Great Sphinx in Egypt.
A World Heritage Site is a place that is listed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as having cultural or natural significance.
Its efforts in China represent "some of the best work we\'ve ever done in the field," said Tim Whalen, director of the Getty Conservation Institute.
The first step is to survey the caves, examine them carefully and understand the materials used to make the paintings.
At Mogao, the Getty team developed a comprehensive plan to conserve the caves and monitor conditions at the site.
The plan was implemented over the last decade at Cave No.
The caves also contain many religious sculptures, including a 1,300-year-old Buddha draped in orange robes that extends more than 100 feet high and nearly 40 feet wide.
Getty specialists worked with Chinese and Australian governments to establish the China Principles \u2014 national guidelines for conserving and managing important cultural heritage sites.
China has vast numbers of historic sites, but managing them was not consistent.
The China Principles filled a critical gap.
The new visitor center shows two films lasting twenty minutes each.
Today the caves are facing a new source of danger: modern tourists.
The Getty\'s work in China is "some of the best work we\'ve ever done in the field," said Tim Whalen, director of the Getty Conservation Institute.
Starting about 1,700 years ago, deep in the Gobi Desert, monks and merchants began to carve caves into the sides of cliffs.
Russian soldiers even sheltered in the caves during a war in the 1920s.

Thanks to holiday shoppers, October, November and December sales are expected to reach $9.6 million, a 5 percent increase.
"Frozen" tells the story of a princess who sets off to find her sister with icy powers, and toys based on the film were extremely popular.
Costing $199.99, the toy company\'s "Kylo Ren" Deluxe LightSaber, which features motion sensor-controlled sound effects is already flying off shelves.

"Of course they are doing enough," Gaballah said when asked about the government\'s efforts, even as the scene around him proved otherwise, just 16 miles from the capital.
But now, for both Christians and Muslim Egyptians alike, that anger has been replaced by a cacophonous silence, even though attacks continue.
There has been, at best, a single arrest in the most recent orgy of church burnings.

The wave of attacks on churches sparked outrage in the weeks immediately after Morsi was pushed out of office.
But they have never had an easy time in the country, often caught between a strictly non-religious government and sometimes hostile Islamists who want the country to return to a strictly Islamic, or Muslim, state.
They included that Muslims had to approve construction of a church, and churches could not face the Nile River or public facilities.
Added to this, Egyptian governments have historically done little to protect Christians from the occasional outbreak of violence from Muslims.
But Christians in Egypt now think that a military government is better for them than a democracy dominated by Muslims.
Egyptian Christians fear that pushing back against an increasingly authoritarian government could somehow lead to something they believe is worse, the return of the Islamists.
A police colonel said there are no specific efforts to go after those who destroyed the churches.
The police officers first want to find out who destroyed their police stations and lock up members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood.
"Our job is not to protect churches," the colonel said, speaking in secret for his own safety.
Other people believe the police have their own reasons for the lack of protection of churches.
He said that when churches are burned the government can blame the Muslim Brotherhood and win support for their crackdown on the Islamists.

Once shot on sight, trapped and poisoned as vermin, wolverines were gone from Washington by the 1930s.
Wolverines used to range along the Cascade Crest from the Canadian border all the way to Mount Rainier, but now remain exceedingly rare, with perhaps just 25 animals in Washington, and only about 250 to 300 in the lower 48 states.
Genetic testing shows the animals they are finding can be traced to populations in Canada that recolonized here once the persecution stopped.
Now, those animals, once just visitors, have established resident populations \u2014 and they are spreading.
It\'s the success, the reward," said Jen Watkins of Conservation Northwest, a Seattle nonprofit, as she dunked pine-branch tips into a bottle of foul-smelling scent lure.
Even as wolverines rebound, threats loom in their future, with [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) over the next 100 years expected to melt out 63 percent of the landscapes where deep snow that wolverines need to survive persists into May.
Fish and Wildlife Service on Friday proposed listing the wolverine for protection as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in at least six Western states, including Washington.
Their long, thick, brown-and-gold coat sheds frost and is underlaid with a soft insulating layer of fur that defeats the most brutal cold.
"They are the superheroes of the animal world," said Shawn Sartorius, a wildlife biologist based in Helena, Montana, for the Fish and Wildlife Service.
For now, ensuring wolverine survival is about planning for the future, Watkins said, by preserving and providing safe access to the strongholds the wide-ranging wolverine are returning to now.

Now innovators are moving beyond the production of solid, static objects to create materials that can be transformed and manipulated at will.
"The project was originally about camouflage," says lead author Mark Guttag, a Ph.D. student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who conducted this study as part of his master\'s thesis.
When the material is compressed, its naturally smooth surface takes on a patterned texture that depends on the spacing and shapes of the embedded rigid polymers.
It can be smooth, ridged or bumpy or can even form more complicated patterns.
Once the material is printed, its rigid polymers are stuck in a fixed array and cannot change positions relative to one another.
"The main thing is the relative sizing of particles and relative spacing of them, as opposed to the absolute size," he says.

Sometimes engineers get ideas from the most unlikely places.
3-D printers used to be able to make only solid and hard objects, like car parts.
It can be used to print soft 3-D materials.
This can make the soft polymer material become smooth, bumpy or rough.
When the two polymers are no longer squeezed, the material returns to its original smooth texture.
It can even make some objects reflective and waterproof.
The new type of 3-D printing could bring new possibilities to many different businesses.
Electric eels can wield their zapping power in subtle and surprising ways.
A new study finds that when dealing with struggling or hard-to-subdue prey, these eels bend their bodies into a horseshoe-like shape to more than double the voltage they deliver to their almost-meal.
The findings, published in the journal Current Biology, shed light on the stunning abilities of these remarkable hunters.
But during his research, Catania started to notice something odd: Many of the eels would curl up their bodies when zapping a meal, bringing their head toward their tail with the fish in between.
So it seemed that by curling their bodies, the eels might be bringing the opposing ends of that organ closer together to concentrate the stunning effect, just as the magnetic field of a horseshoe magnet is concentrated by bringing the positive and negative poles together.
The findings are part of a growing body of research showing that eels do not use their electric powers as a blunt tool, but in a myriad of subtle and sophisticated ways.
A new study finds that when dealing with struggling or hard-to-subdue prey, these eels bend their bodies into a horseshoe-like shape to more than double the voltage they deliver to their almost-meal.
Once the eels shock their quarry, they reposition it in the water so they can swallow it head-first.
In that brief moment, the fish, if it can withstand the electric attack, has its only chance to swim off and avoid becoming an eel meal.

"Even an animal that\'s been studied for centuries may be doing amazing things that we were unaware of (until) we look closely," said study author Kenneth Catania.
Earlier, he discovered that they can "remote control" their prey, by sending out a jolt of electricity that forces hidden fish to twitch and thus reveal their location.
The only time they did was when they were trying to subdue particularly difficult prey, such as a large crayfish, which could take extra time to properly reposition.
In effect the the animal was paralyzed temporarily, making it safe for the eel to release and reposition it.
Catania still wants to explore a basic and perplexing question: How does the eel avoid shocking itself?

Catania observed that younger, smaller eels with less shocking power curled up frequently during their electric attacks.
The two ends work together to produce a stronger magnetic force than one end alone could.
He took a brain-dead fish equipped with electricity-conducting electrodes and put it near an eel as bait.
Electric eels can use their zapping power in surprising and sophisticated ways.
Eels are a snake-like fish that live underwater.
Some have a special power.
Bigger, older eels almost never bothered to curl up.
Such prey take extra power to knock out.
Catania decided to design an experiment to test his idea.
He took a fish and put it near an eel as bait.
It was in early 2014 that federal officials and immigrant rights activists noticed a disturbing trend at the U.S. border with Mexico.
Now that the exodus has eased, how are the children doing?
"I believe a large number, 50 percent, have been able to show up in immigration court and have been allowed to stay, avoiding deportation," said Nora Sandigo, leader of American Fraternity.
"Immigration authorities keep requiring me to report my whereabouts and that affects my ability to get a stable job," said Cindy Figueroa Castro, a Honduran mother whose 4-year-old child was among the children who crossed the border last year.
For Jose Cruz, a Cuban-American and former Jesuit priest who helped resettle young Cubans during the Pedro Pan exodus in the 1960s, the Central American minors are facing a crisis.
Thus far, the White House has not responded, Cruz said.
"It\'s because they are thousands of miles away from their families and native lands, having been abruptly separated because of unspeakable violence in their home countries.
The surge in unaccompanied minors shocked the nation as arrivals reached record levels.
Depending on who you talk to, some of the children are doing relatively well, others are dealing with various issues and still others are facing a crisis.
Sandigo said the main issues are a lack of attorneys to represent the children in court and not enough resources for public schools.
Cheryl Little, executive director of Americans for Immigrant Justice, said the children face special challenges.
It was in early 2014 that federal officials and immigrant rights activists noticed a disturbing trend at the U.S. border with Mexico.
Tens of thousands of children were crossing illegally without their parents.
Overall, Schuster said, the children may be facing problems \u2014 but not in the schools.
She is a Honduran mother whose 4-year-old child was among the children who crossed the border last year.
Thus far, the White House has not responded, aid Cruz.
John Schuster of the Miami-Dade County public schools said the Central American children have been welcomed in the local schools "with open arms."
Early in 2014, federal officials and immigrant rights activists noticed a disturbing trend at the U.S. border with Mexico.
Early in 2014, U.S. officials and immigrant rights activists noticed something disturbing happening at the border with Mexico.
Nora Sandigo says she thinks that half of the minors who crossed the border have been allowed to stay in the country.
Francisco Portillo is president of another group, Francisco Morazan Honduran Organization.
They do not have insurance and do not get regular health care, he said.
Cruz and Herrera have asked the White House to let them supervise the status of Central American children in the U.S.
"While so many of the children we see are thrilled to finally feel safe and have opportunities they never dared dream of, a number of them could use some help adjusting to life in America," Little said.
As Jason Thrasher set down his firefighting helicopter, he saw what he thought was another helicopter battling the blaze.
And we have seen some good signs that the [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) \u2014 staghorn coral \u2014 continues to be abundant and may even be increasing in abundance in some places," said Richard Dodge, executive director of the National Coral Reef Institute at Nova Southeastern University.
Greater public awareness prompted boaters to avoid dropping anchors on the fragile reef.
And a decision to move ship anchorages farther offshore from Port Everglades prevented damaging groundings.
Conservationists say the reefs also will benefit from Everglades restoration projects designed to filter out pollutants rather than channel fertilizer-laden water out to sea.
"People are aware they need to take better care of our coral reefs to help get them through what no doubt will be a stressful time, as the climate continues to change," said Chris Bergh, South Florida conservation director for The Nature Conservancy.
"There are a lot of big and expensive things that still need to be done, and I guess the most expensive of all is getting a handle on the root causes of climate change, which are essentially greenhouse gas emissions."
To help restore damaged reefs, scientists at the National Coral Reef Institute in Dania Beach are growing baby corals in indoor nurseries and transplanting them offshore.
"There\'s no doubt that if we destroy those beautiful reefs, there will be some significant economic impact," said Abraham Pizam, director of the Institute for Tourism Studies at the University of Central Florida.
But nevertheless, it\'s an important element that should be preserved for generations to come."
A federal study released this month brought more good news: Coral reefs may be able to adapt to warmer sea temperatures.
And we have seen some good signs that the [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) \u2014 staghorn coral \u2014 continues to be abundant and may even be increasing in abundance in some places," said Richard Dodge, executive director of the National Coral Reef Institute at Nova Southeastern University.
But we are lucky in South Florida to avoid a lot of hurricanes and tropical storms lately.
Studies in 2000 and 2004 found that reefs along the southeast Florida coast generated $6 billion of economic activity and supported 71,000 jobs.
We still worry about bleaching, which appears to be caused by warmer water temperatures.

But, he added, "The bad news is: There are still some coral diseases out there.
Without fish, you don\'t have divers, you don\'t have snorkelers."
They took shape as free-swimming coral larvae attached themselves to submerged ridges in warm, shallow waters.
These prevent polluted water from seeping into the ocean.

So do thousands of other kinds of animals and plants.
"Without reefs, you don\'t have fish," said diving shop owner Jeff Torode.
Democratic Representative Derek Kilmer said he wanted to back the plan because starfish were "turning into goo."
"It\'s pretty horrific," Harvell said.
The fumes to which they are exposed come from cigarettes smoked mainly by male co-workers.
According to the most recent national survey, 288 million men smoked regularly in China in 2010, compared with 13 million women.
The women are striking back.
"This is a very important step," said Yang Gonghuan, a doctor who has been documenting tobacco\'s toll on Chinese public health since the 1980s.
For example, retired pro basketball player Yao Ming has lent his name to the cause.
At the same time, Chinese leaders such as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping smoked openly in public, encouraging the habit among men.
Smoking has remained common in public places across the country, particularly in rural areas, where half of the population lives.
Large numbers of doctors in China smoke, and it was not until 2010 that the Health Ministry banned smoking in its own building.
Individual cities have enacted their own restrictions on tobacco.
Xu Guihua, of the Chinese Association on Tobacco Control, said enforcement of the rules would be all-important, and would require a shift in the culture of China.
Nearly every day in China, women go to work in smoke-filled offices.
"It is very difficult to push for these kinds of changes on a national level," she said.
Smoking has remained common in public places across the country, particularly in rural areas, where half of the population lives.
Even so, Xu is hopeful that change will indeed come.
China is so addicted to smoking that the country is known as the Smoking Dragon.
"This is a very important step," said Yang Gonghuan, a doctor who has been documenting tobacco\'s toll on Chinese health since the 1980s.
Smoking has remained common in public places across the country, particularly in the countryside, where half of the population lives.
However, women smoke far less then men do.
Women have been very important in efforts to control smoking.
The Chinese government came up with a tough new set of rules on smoking and tobacco sales.
China is known for its smog created by smoke from factories and cars.
Each year, about 1 million Chinese die from diseases caused by smoking.
However, things changed after most Chinese switched from pipes to cigarettes during the early 1900s.
These days, Peng is well-known for speaking out against smoking.
In a press briefing at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, Mexican archaeologists say that the new rooms contained thousands of objects, including carved statues, rubber balls, jade from Guatemala and a wooden box of shells.
The tunnel, discovered 11 years ago under the Temple of the Feathered Serpent at the heart of the ancient metropolis, is the latest piece in a puzzle dating back to before Europeans arrived in the New World.
It will probably take years of analysis to truly understand the significance of each object and the assemblage, he added.
He and his team announced Wednesday that three more chambers lay beyond the initial two, oriented in a sort of cross just a few dozen feet down the tunnel.
And the hypothesis is that there is a burial site but we won\'t know for sure until next year."
It will probably take years of analysis to truly understand the significance of each object and the assemblage, he added.
The discovery of a royal burial under the Temple of the Feathered Serpent might upend everything known about the city.
In and around those chambers he found more puzzling objects, including a wooden box filled with shells imported from the ocean and carved by stone tools.
In addition, there were four 23.6-inch-tall (60 centimeters) jade statues, rubber balls and jaguar remains.
And the hypothesis is that there is a burial site but we won\'t know for sure until next year."
Scientists with the Mexican government announced Wednesday the discovery of three new chambers at the end of a tunnel under the ancient city of Teotihuacan.

And the hypothesis is that there is a burial site but we won\'t know for sure until next year."
"Just before the chambers is where we found very important offerings \u2014 a lot of them alongside many objects," says Sergio Gomez, who directs the excavation project.
Such offerings would likely have been made to honor a deceased person or persons of great importance.
"These findings are very important, both for the quantity and the quality of materials being discovered," commented Professor George Cowgill, who directs a research center at Teotihuacan.
It will probably take years of analysis to truly understand the significance of each object and why they were placed together, he added.
A high point came in 2013 with the discovery of two chambers on either side of the tunnel, which were filled with metal mirrors and strange crystal spheres.
He said it is possible there are buried nobles hidden under debris or even below the chamber floors.
He believes that "there is a burial site but we won\'t know for sure until next year."
Scientists with the Mexican government announced Wednesday that three new chambers had been discovered at the end of a tunnel beneath the ancient city of Teotihuacan.
Cowgill added that other objects in the chambers support the idea that women were important in Teotihuacan society and show that trade was carried out with distant peoples.

Teotihuacan is located in the mountains just outside Mexico City.
It is located beneath an important religious building, the Temple of the Feathered Serpent.
So far, though, no bodies have been found.
The chambers were filled with mirrors and strange crystal balls.

Now scientists at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have figured out a way to use ocean waves to simulate the ground motion that occurs in real earthquakes.
The "virtual earthquake" technique is being used to better understand the effect of shaking on cities that have not had a large earthquake in recent years, said Marine Denolle, co-author of the Science study.
The scientists are not trying to predict when an earthquake will happen.
Ocean waves create seismic waves billions of times weaker than the seismic waves produced by earthquakes.
The waves functioned as substitutes for seismic waves created by earthquakes.
They revealed that seismic waves from the southern San Andreas Fault will become more powerful when they reach the soft sediment beneath Los Angeles.
In this case, the water represents the soft ground and the tub represents the solid rocks around it.
He is a geophysics professor at Stanford and co-wrote the study.
The research group plans to test the virtual earthquake technique in other parts of Southern California and in other cities around the world, he said.
The virtual earthquake technique was developed as a way to test computer simulations of Southern California earthquakes, Beroza said.
"Sometime in the future we\'ll have a big earthquake in Southern California, and these sorts of studies can help us anticipate the reach of these earthquakes and \u2026 can motivate the public and governments to prepare for them."
"It\'s virtually certain that we will have a damaging earthquake in the future.
Scientists who study earthquakes often find that ocean waves get in the way, especially in California.
The effect, Denolle said, can be compared to shaking a bathtub with water in it.

Seismic waves are waves of energy that move through the Earth.
The new technique is being used to better understand the effect of shaking on cities that have not had a large earthquake in recent years, said Marine Denolle.
For the Science study, Denolle installed seismometers along the San Andreas Fault in the spring of 2010.
The waves acted as substitutes for seismic waves created by earthquakes.
Donelle was a grad student at Stanford during the study.
She is now continuing her research at the University of California.
Other cities rest atop sedimentary basins, too.
The research group plans to test this new method in other parts of Southern California and in other cities around the world, he said.
He works for a government program that keeps track of the dangers from earthquakes.
The new research is attractive in that it uses real seismic waves and "gives us some confidence that we\'re on the right track with the computer models," he said.

They use the waves to recreate how the ground moves in real earthquakes.
The reason is the city sits on top of a soft piece of the Earth, they said.
The new way the scientists studied the waves is known as the "virtual earthquake technique."
It is being used to better understand the effect of shaking on cities that have not had a large earthquake in several years, said Marine Denolle.
For the Science study, Denolle installed seismometers along the San Andreas Fault.
These cities all are in extra danger if there is an earthquake.

Scientists have found fossil-like hints that some kind of life existed on Earth 4.1 billion years ago \u2014 when the planet was a mere volcanic toddler.
Think of it as "the gooey remains of biotic life or anything more complicated," said study co-author Mark Harrison, a UCLA geochemistry professor.
"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth," Hedges wrote in an email, "then it could be common in the universe."

Scientists usually find this mix in leftover bits of living things, Harrison said.
Earlier this year Los Angeles residents met about a new plan to release thousands of mosquitoes in their backyards.
Yet if two mosquitoes that both have Wolbachia mate, then their resulting eggs will hatch as normal, although the offspring will potentially harbor Wolbachia.
Wiping out one species of mosquito also means that others could potentially come in and fill that niche.
But in an area like Los Angeles County where there were not any mosquitoes that carry dengue or chikungunya until recently, Dobson says it makes sense to try to target this disease-carrying population\u2014making competing mosquitoes less of a priority.
"We can\'t control mosquitoes with a single approach, and this is a new way with great potential," says Stephen Higgs, a Kansas State University infectious disease expert who was not involved in the work.
Earlier this year Los Angeles residents met about a new plan to release thousands of mosquitoes in their backyards.
Both cause severe pain in the joints and muscles, as well as fever.
The test bugs will all be male, which do not bite humans as female mosquitoes do.
Residents were told the method should help reduce pesticide use and their mosquito population at the same time.
They are males raised in a laboratory and infected with Wolbachia, a natural bacteria that effectively sterilizes them.
Dobson believes that because the Asian Tiger mosquitoes are still new to California, they can be controlled.
His hope is to establish the bacteria among many generations of mosquitoes in the wild so that they will not die out, they will just not be able to pass on disease with their bite.
Wiping out one species of mosquito also means that others could potentially fill that gap.
"We can\'t control mosquitoes with a single approach, and this is a new way with great potential," says Stephen Higgs, a Kansas State University disease expert.

The dump truck rumbled over miles of unpaved roads in the hills just east of the Montana border, past the cattle and grain bins and haystacks, before arriving at the dirt pit.
On the crowded Bakken roads, truck crashes that led to severe injuries jumped twelvefold during a recent four-year period.
A driver from an Alexandria, Minnesota, company was pulled over this summer while hauling a crane that was 61,300 pounds overweight.
Trucker Michael Fisher, who acknowledged driving overweight, said one problem is being able to adequately slow down.
After word spread of a state official weighing each truck coming through a dirt pit earlier this year, one trucker dumped his load out at the side of the road.
The truck weighed in at more than 113,000 pounds \u2014 nearly 25,000 pounds over what it was licensed to haul.
Fisher flashed the man operating the front-end loader a "three" and "five" with his hands to signal that he wanted 35 tons, then lit up a Marlboro Red as the man dropped giant buckets of dirt into his truck.
Heading north back to the pit, Gore fielded a call about another job that would pay $100 an hour.

"If those opportunities don\'t exist to find therapies that save lives, we really find ourselves at a disadvantage \u2026 all of us, frankly, not just kids, but adults, too," Grollman said.
He said that there are two sides to the issue: the innovation developed through medical research and a qualified workforce.
"The big crisis in health care really is having available and qualified trained health care professionals out there," he said, adding that the Whiteheads\' "just have provided hope to a lot of families around the world."

"The U.S. has failed America\'s families by not meaningfully protecting child farm workers from dangers to their health and safety, including on tobacco farms," said Margaret Wurth, children\'s rights researcher and co-author of the report.
"Farming is hard work anyway, but children working on tobacco farms get so sick that they throw up, get covered by pesticides and have no real protective gear."
The children also said they worked long hours \u2014 often in extreme heat \u2014 without overtime pay or sufficient breaks and wore no, or inadequate, protective gear.
"The conditions are inhumane and they should improve them," said 17-year-old Erick Garcia, of Kinston, North Carolina, who has been working in tobacco fields since he was 11 to help his family earn more money.
You may have to be at least 18 to buy cigarettes in the United States, but children as young as 7 are working long hours in fields harvesting nicotine- and pesticide-laced tobacco leaves under sometimes hazardous and sweltering conditions, according to a report released Wednesday by an international rights group.
According to the report, U.S. agriculture labor laws allow children to work longer hours at younger ages and in more hazardous conditions than children in any other industry.
In 2011, the Labor Department proposed changes that would have prohibited children under 16 from working on tobacco farms, but they were withdrawn in 2012.
According to the report, U.S. agriculture labor laws allow children to work longer hours at younger ages and in more hazardous conditions than children in any other industry.
Additionally, Garcia said kids should primarily focus on school and shouldn\'t be in the fields: "That\'s not a place for children," he said.
You may have to be at least 18 to buy cigarettes in the United States, but children as young as 7 are working long hours in fields harvesting nicotine- and pesticide-laced tobacco leaves under sometimes hazardous and sweltering conditions, according to a report released Wednesday by an international rights group.
"It\'s hard manual labor, but there\'s nothing wrong with hard manual labor."
According to a report released Wednesday, children as young as 7 are working long hours harvesting nicotine- and pesticide-laced tobacco leaves.
"Farming is hard work anyway, but children working on tobacco farms get so sick that they throw up."
The companies, the group said, are concerned about child labor in their supply chains and have developed standards.
The group acknowledges that most of what it documented is legal under U.S. law.
According to a report released Wednesday, children as young as 7 are working long hours in tobacco fields.
It is "not meaningfully protecting child farmworkers from dangers to their health and safety, including on tobacco farms."
U.S. agriculture labor laws allow children to work longer hours at younger ages and in more hazardous conditions than children in any other industry.
In 2011, the Labor Department proposed changes that would have prohibited children under 16 from working on tobacco farms.
However, these suggested changes were withdrawn in 2012.
The companies, the group said, are concerned about child labor and have developed standards.
You have to be at least 18 to buy cigarettes in the U.S.
"The U.S. has failed America\'s families," said report co-author Margaret Wurth.
They reported experiencing headaches, upset stomachs and vomiting.
To help limit it, they have developed standards for the growers who supply them with tobacco.
Growers are required to follow child labor laws.
"The conditions are inhumane and they should improve them," said 17-year-old Erick Garcia, of North Carolina.
Additionally, Garcia said kids should mostly be focused on school and shouldn\'t be in the fields: "That\'s not a place for children," he said.
Like millions of parents, Aaron Sacharow welcomes those moments when his son \u2014 7-year-old Tyler \u2014 takes a break from video games and picks up a book instead.
"I don\'t want to say it tricks them into reading," says Sacharow, an IT project manager based in Miramar, Florida.
"Kids, parents and teachers were all saying \'Minecraft\' was good for you.
Kira Porton, store manager of A Children\'s Place Bookstore in Portland, Oregon, says the guides could well become as popular as such top-selling series as "The Diary of a Wimpy Kid" and "Percy Jackson."
The minimalist indie game was originally released by creator Markus "Notch" Persson almost three years ago and went on to become a phenomenon.
A senior editor for books at Amazon.com, Chris Schluep notes that other game-related releases have succeeded.

The game "Minecraft" was originally released in 2011 and has sold more than 50 million copies worldwide.
Since last November, the illustrated "Minecraft" guides have become one of the most successful book series.
"We started watching a lot of YouTube videos to see what the buzz was about."
Bookstore manager Kira Porton says the guides could well become as popular as such top-selling series as "The Diary of a Wimpy Kid" and "Percy Jackson."
Porton initially ordered just a few copies of the guides for her store.
She soon found herself repeatedly asking for more.

About 30 percent of college-aged people reported having some type of mental illness during 2010 and 2011, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
"What I look for is someone who is acting opposite of as you know them - someone who\'s more irritable than they normally would be, someone who\'s more withdrawn than they normally would be," Neal told Reuters Health.
Trainers should follow the protocol of their institution and call law enforcement if the person is violent.
"With special populations, especially populations of people who are particularly goal-oriented, particularly high achievers, particularly focused, there still is a sense of stigmatization, a sense of shame," Schwenk, who was not part of the task force, told Reuters Health.
He said one strategy for reaching out to athletes is to frame mental healthcare as a way to improve their performance in their sport.
His preliminary observation: The densest concentrations run from Dania Beach to Lighthouse Point and then from Boynton Inlet to Jupiter.
The shark was placed on the boat to be brought back for analysis of its stomach contents, as well as for students to study its vertebrae, muscle and skin tissue.
Last year, during the late March migration, two people suffered bites, a man on a kiteboard off Delray Beach and a 9-year-old boy on a surfboard or boogie board off North Palm Beach.
After a minute or two, he swam toward the boat, hauling the shark with one arm.
"We\'re interested in what these sharks are doing when they\'re here, and we\'re interested in their movements," he said.
When there are too many of the kinds of fish sharks eat, such as mullet, the balance of ocean life can be disrupted.
With too few plant-eating fish around, algae can become overgrown and fragile coral reefs might be damaged.
These are usually non-life-threatening incidents, however, in which the shark clamps down on a hand or foot in murky water and quickly lets go once it realizes it has not bitten down on a fish.

On a Tuesday morning off John D. MacArthur Beach State Park, Kajiura and his three students set out to hook sharks and fit them with audio transmitters, each of which gives off a unique pattern of high-pitched pings.
The team managed to catch two sharks, but the trip still ended up being a failure.
But because the water was so rough, Kajiura decided to head to deeper, smoother water before doing the surgery required to implant a transmitter.
It will soon add stations at Dania Beach and Juno Beach.
On a boat off Singer Island, Stephen Kajiura and a crew of students set out baited hooks for sharks.

Kajiura is catching them and putting transmitters inside their bodies.
Those fish eat other, smaller fish and there end up being too few of the smaller fish.
They may no longer come down as far as South Florida.
The pings are so high-pitched that they cannot be heard by fish or other ocean animals.
About 4,500 students in the Orange County Public Schools participate in agriscience programs like the one at Colonial, Garner said.
But Orange County educators say studying agriscience can help students prepare for a wide range of careers, such as becoming veterinarians, scientists or nutritionists.
And App said helping students explore their options, including eliminating those that are a bad fit, is a priority.
Students arrive on campus before the first class starts at 7:27 a.m. to feed the goats, and the students come in on weekends and over school breaks.
"As the Cuban government has reiterated on multiple occasions, Cuba rejects and condemns all acts of terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, as well as any act whose objective is to encourage, support, finance or give shelter to terrorists," the statement read.
In his notification to Congress, Obama certified that "the government of Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding six-month period" and "has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future."
In the four months since Obama and Castro announced they would move toward normalization, high-level Cuban and U.S. officials have held three rounds of talks on the initial step of establishing formal relations.
But the administration has said that such acts are not part of the law.
"I think it would be nice if the Cubans sent back the terrorists that they\'re harboring who have killed American law enforcement officers," McCain said Monday.
"Our hemisphere, and the world, look very different today than they did 33 years ago," Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement.
It follows a pledge made by Obama and Cuban President Ra\xfal Castro last December to move toward normal relations.
If Cuba is taken off the terror list, only three countries remain: Iran, Sudan and Syria.
For its part, the United States said that its diplomats must be able to freely move around the island and that Cuban citizens could not be kept from entering the U.S. Embassy.
Democratic Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois participated in efforts to reach an accord with Cuba.

As cousins Richard Norris and James Norris watched, a light wind began moving huge floes of ice across the surface of the water and into rocks weighing up to 200 pounds.
Their photos last Dec. 21 provided the final evidence in solving a mystery of the Racetrack Playa that has long puzzled visitors and scientists: What mechanism moves rocks across flat dirt in the heart of the hottest, driest place on Earth?
Rocks of various heft \u2014 some weighing 600 pounds or more \u2014 leave trails that wiggle like snakes or form complete loops or even rectangles.
"In a place where rainfall averages 2 inches a year, rocks are being shoved around by mechanisms typically seen in arctic climes."
Ralph Lorenz, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory who had investigated playa rock movement for a decade, believed strongly enough that ice floes were the cause that he erected time lapse cameras in the area about seven years ago.
The Norrises subscribed to a different theory, believing hurricane-force winds were the cause.
Richard Norris, 55, a paleobiologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and James, 59, a research engineer, launched their "Slithering Stones Research Initiative" in 2011.
The "GPS stones," which were engineered to record movement and velocity, were stationed at the southern end of the playa where rocks begin their strange journeys after tumbling down a cliff.
The rocks slid along the slushy, slippery mud on trajectories determined by the direction and velocity of the winds.
"While it takes away the mystery, it also underscores what an amazingly rare and wonderful mechanism is at work there," Lorenz said.
Their photos last Dec. 21 provided the final evidence in solving a mystery of the Racetrack Playa that has long puzzled visitors and scientists: What mechanism moves rocks across flat dirt in the heart of the hottest, driest place on Earth?
The trails are cut sharply into the ground but no other tracks are visible.
The playa was transformed into a shallow lake where the GPS stones recorded movements on sunny days with light winds following nights of subfreezing temperatures.
The rocks slid along the slushy, slippery mud on trajectories determined by the direction and velocity of the winds.
The cracking sounds were ferocious.
On Dec. 20, the two cousins returned to inspect the instruments.
The normally dry lake bed here in Death Valley National Park is known as "the Racetrack Playa" \u2014 a playa being an area of flat dried-up land.
Their photos last Dec. 21 provided the final evidence in solving a mystery of the Racetrack Playa that has long puzzled visitors and scientists: What is it that moves rocks across flat dirt in the heart of the hottest, driest place on Earth?
"In a place where rainfall averages 2 inches a year, rocks are being shoved around" by processes "typically seen in arctic climes."
The "GPS stones" were specially engineered to record movement and velocity.
Panes of ice hundreds of feet across and as thin as 1/4-inch thick blew into the rocks.
Then, the rocks slid along the slushy, slippery mud along paths determined by the direction and velocity of the winds.
The cracking sounds were ferocious as an ankle-deep, frozen lake broke apart under sunny skies.
James Norris said of their discovery.
A playa is simply an area of flat dried-up land.
The proof that those rocks are indeed moving is what they leave behind them: trails in the dirt.
However, until that dramatic and lucky day last December, no one had been able to prove anything definitively.
"There\'s a shortage of workers in a number of careers, and the numbers of those jobs are staggering," said Harley Hepner, the Illinois State Board of Education\'s chief consultant for ag education.
Classes include animal science, plant and soil science, separate offerings of advanced animal and plant science, natural resources, and an introductory course.
Seven Kansas high schools and four in Nebraska joined the fold in the past school year.
"It\'s helped me find my way back."
Classmate Alicia Perez, 17, once dismissed learning about agriculture, convinced "this is gonna be for people who wanna be farmers."
Not so, she now submits.
"My heart is in culinary arts, and there are so many different careers you can pursue in agriculture.
"The only thing I planted was a small garden, and the only thing that grew out of it were weeds," she admits.
"This is about understanding the environment and the world around you as it relates to animals, plants and food, then going out with those skills to get a good career."
"Before this (program) came, I was in a dark place," she said.
"My heart is in culinary arts, and there are so many different careers you can pursue in agriculture.
The courses are rich in science and are being considered as stepping stones for students thinking about careers including city forestry, natural resources and the genetic engineering of crops.
Many FFA members have little to do with farms, as Rebecca Goodman illustrates.
Goodman has lived in Indianapolis since she was 3 and before she joined FFA had never been on a farm.
Teachers say the Academy helps students, who struggle with some subjects in traditional math and science classes, to make a connection with the real world.
She added, "Before this (program) came, I was in a dark place.
"My heart is in culinary arts, and there are so many different careers you can pursue in agriculture."
Perez added, "This is definitely something you have to go into to realize it\'s so much broader."
Goodman has lived in Indianapolis since she was 3, and had never been on a farm before she joined the FFA.
The Academy pays for itself thanks to help from the state, which gives an allowance per each student in the district depending on the class.
It has helped me find my way back," she said, Her classmate Alicia Perez used to believe that learning about agriculture was only for people who wanted to be farmers.
High school programs on agriculture are popping up all across the middle of the country.
The Academy is a place where students can explore live animals and plants closely.
It also includes an introduction course on agriculture.
His mother was a bookkeeper; his father a construction worker who struggled with alcoholism.
"Her goal in life was to educate her children because she thought that was the only way out of Englewood," Richardson said over breakfast at a pancake house down the street from his office, "and so she was a strict disciplinarian; stressed academics; stressed excellence."
"Part of it is having grown up in an area like this," he said after leaving Cannon\'s home in the Garfield Park neighborhood.
"I think what makes you tick is the impact you have on lives," Richardson said one night in his office.
That approach was her way of making sure her four children avoided the destructive path many young people took in Englewood.
While his neighborhood friends "were into all sorts of bad things," they protected him and his younger brother, Lendell, who also became a physician.
Three days a week, Richardson, 54, helps them with their classwork at no charge.
There are many reasons Richardson became a doctor, including his Christian faith, but it all started with his mother, Gladys Richardson.
Gladys supported the family, somehow keeping her four kids in Catholic schools.
In medical school, he was the only African-American male in his class.
He asked about her shortness of breath, whether she has had more belly problems, and gently massaged her hands, asking if they hurt.
Richardson did not know any black doctors as role models when he entered Rush Medical College in Chicago in 1982.
They moved frequently, and Richardson remembers spending a night in a homeless shelter.
He says he sleeps four hours a night and does not drink alcohol or coffee.
The family lived in a poor area with few jobs and much crime.
"Her goal in life was to educate her children because she thought that was the only way out of Englewood," Richardson said, describing the tough South Side neighborhood where he grew up.

This technology now illuminates our smart phone screens and phone flashlights, as well as many household lights and even the twinkling lights put on Christmas trees.
This year the Nobel Committee decided to honor a physics discovery that benefits us all: lightbulbs.
"Something like a fourth of our electricity consumption goes to illumination," Nobel Prize committee member Olle Ingan\xe4s of Link\xf6ping University in Sweden said during a press conference Oct. 7 announcing the award.
"A lot of big companies really tried to do this and they failed," said Nobel committee member Per Delsing of Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden.
The achievement required the growth of high-quality gallium nitride crystals, which are semiconductors.
Inside semiconductors, electrons and "holes," or spaces without electrons, can move around the crystal lattice to allow electrical current to flow.
When the right voltage is applied to the semiconductor, electrons and holes will recombine and emit light.
This technology now illuminates our smart phone screens and phone flashlights, as well as many household lights and even the twinkling lights put on Christmas trees.
Akasaki and Amano worked together at the University of Nagoya to make the discovery, and Nakamura worked independently at the Nichia Chemicals company in Tokushima, Japan.
Akasaki was also informed by phone, but the Nobel Prize committee had not yet reached Amano when it made the announcement, because he happened to be flying from Japan to France.

Inside semiconductors, electrons and "holes," or spaces without electrons, can move around the crystal lattice structure to allow electrical current to flow.
When the right voltage is applied to the semiconductor, electrons and holes join and give off light.
The white light sources enabled by the discovery of blue LEDs last much longer and require much less energy than traditional incandescent lightbulbs.
Instead, LEDs more efficiently convert energy directly into light, without the heat.
Fluorescent lights rely on mercury, which pollutes the environment when it is thrown away.
LED technology now illuminates our smart phone screens and phone flashlights, as well as many household lights, and even the twinkling lights put on Christmas trees.
And because ultraviolet light kills bacteria, blue LEDs could potentially be used to sterilize and purify drinking water in the future, Delsing said.

U.S. President Barack Obama announced on Saturday that he was postponing U.S. missile strikes against the Syrian government until he can get Congress to back the attacks.
"We were happy when we first heard that the U.S. would attack, but then when it was postponed, we were afraid that Bashar would attack the camp," said Raad Zoubi, 23, who has lived in the dusty, sun-stricken swath of tents and prefabricated metal huts for the past year.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that evidence showed that sarin gas was used.
Camp residents heard Obama reveal his decision to postpone the operation on live broadcasts of his announcement on Saturday.
And on Sunday, some in Congress were skeptical that Obama could win approval.
From there, they were to walk to Syrian territory controlled by rebels of the Free Syrian Army, a loose amalgam of rebel groups.
The buses were preceded by a truck hauling a trailer with windows cut into its sides and stairs that swung down from the rear.
U.S. President Barack Obama announced on Saturday that he was postponing U.S. missile strikes against the Syrian government until he can get Congress to back the attacks.
U.N. inspectors have not confirmed if the gas was used.
They are still conducting tests on samples collected in Syria last week.
U.S. President Barack Obama announced Saturday that he was postponing U.S. missile strikes against the Syrian government in order to first seek approval from Congress.
Cuba and the United States have had a tension-filled past.The United States cut its relations with Cuba in 1961, two years after communist leader Fidel Castro seized power.
Cuba has already freed Gross and sent him home to the United States.

Travel to Cuba was also limited.
In Cuba, the Cuban Five are hailed as heroes and "freedom fighters" unfairly imprisoned by the United States.
Havana has not yet released a public statement.
Some 280,000 people, mostly the descendants of 18th-century German immigrants, live in Amish communities scattered through the United States.

Pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria account for about one-third of all the under-age-5 deaths, the report found.
But some simple interventions can help, he said, including newer vaccines against childhood diarrhea and pneumonia.
For newborns, early breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact, also called kangaroo care, are hugely important, Chopra added.
The Success Factors project examined Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Laos, Nepal, Peru, Rwanda and Vietnam, and found a variety of strategies tailored to different populations.
You also need roads to get there," noted lead researcher Shyama Kuruvilla of the World Health Organization\'s Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, which coordinated the project.
In Rwanda, for example, 64 percent of parliamentarians are women, and China, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam have developed industries that employ more women, the report said.
UNICEF likewise found newborn mortality rates lower for educated mothers.
It found that eight of the 60 countries with particularly high child mortality had lowered their rates by more than two-thirds since 1990: Malawi, Bangladesh, Liberia, Tanzania, Ethiopia, East Timor, Niger and Eritrea.
Pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria account for about one-third of all the under-age-5 deaths, the report found.
But he said those illnesses, along with malaria, are easily preventable with relatively inexpensive antibiotics.
How do poor countries take the steps needed to lower child mortality?
UNICEF likewise found newborn mortality rates lower for educated mothers.
"We\'re making much faster progress with the older children," Chopra noted.
By region, the problem is most serious in sub-Saharan Africa, with a rate of 92 deaths for every 1,000 live births.
Pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria caused about a third of all the under-age-5 deaths, the report found.
However, those illnesses, along with malaria, are easily preventable with inexpensive antibiotics.
However, things like clean water, improved sanitation and better roads are key to those health efforts.
UNICEF also found newborn mortality rates lower for educated mothers.
Chopra said that pneumonia and diarrhea are so widespread because they are easily passed from person to person.
Educating a woman so that she knows her infant needs vaccination does not help if there are no vaccines.
In Nepal, for example, thousands of female health volunteers visit homes.
To study this issue, researchers look at how often children die before their fifth birthday.
India and Nigeria, which both have large populations, saw one-third of all child deaths around the world.
About one-third of all deaths of children younger than 5 were caused by one of three things: diarrhea, malaria and pneumonia.
However, things like clean water and better roads are important everywhere.
Lost in the flurry of corporate malfeasance and consumer outrage over the Volkswagen emissions cheating scandal is another victim \u2014 the Volkswagen dealer.
The product they sell is tainted, and the consumers they serve are furious, while the world waits to learn what the car company will do to resolve the problem.
Following an independent investigation, Volkswagen has admitted installing "defeat devices" in as many as 11 million diesel engines.
"Volkswagen\'s acknowledged misconduct regarding its vehicle emissions has been extremely disappointing, and dealers are deeply concerned about how this breach of trust will affect their customers," said Charles Cyrill, spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association, which represents 16,000 new car and truck sales entities.
"Unlike the runaway Toyotas or the GM ignition switches, no one has died because of this problem \u2014 and people seem to forget that," said the manager of a prominent Southern California VW dealership.
Venezuela has been a socialist country since Hugo Chavez was elected president in 1998 and took over many businesses.
But the price of oil has dropped 50 percent in the past few months, so it will earn less money from exports this year.
Delgado is among the many people who supported the late Hugo Chavez and are still behind the government.
Venezuelans have to wait in long lines for sugar, cooking oil, soap, rice and other things that are in short supply.
She spent three hours in line to buy toilet paper and she had to come back the next day to get corn flour.
Jose Delgado, a janitor, was also standing in line.

The ursine marauders wandered into tents, overturned garbage cans and, on rare occasions, injured tourists.
"You\'d drive your car to the park and then it got destroyed because you left a candy bar in the door," said Mike Tollefson, a former Yosemite superintendent.
Reports of bears damaging property or injuring people in the park have fallen 92 percent \u2014 from 1,584 in 1998 to 120 last year.
Biologists say the long, slow turnaround came from an unlikely strategy \u2014 training the bears but, more importantly, training people.
There has never been a recorded incident of a black bear killing a person in Yosemite, or anywhere in California.
Next, the park launched a massive public education campaign.
A study in March using isotopes to analyze bear fur and bones found a 63 percent drop in the proportion of human food that black bears are consuming now, compared with the 1970s and 1980s.
Damage from bears in the park has fallen an astounding 99 percent \u2014 from $659,569 in 1998 to $7,508 last year.
"Bears that get too habitualized to people lose their fear of people," Johnson said.
"Although a bear has never killed a person in Yosemite, they certainly have the ability if they wanted to.
The less interaction between the two, the better for everybody."
"More and more people are doing what they are supposed to do.

Yosemite has between 300 and 500 black bears.
"Have you ever been in a vehicle or house that a bear has been in it?

The park also required all campers to store food in steel, bear-proof lockers.
The less contact between the two, "the better for everybody," he said.
They are behaving better.
The "mother bears taught their cubs how to climb up and get it."
The less contact between the two, "the better for everybody," he said.
In 1997, black bears broke into more than 600 cars in Yosemite National Park.
Perhaps more importantly, they are training people to keep food away from bears.

The trend is all the more striking given that the overall unemployment rate has steadily dropped, to 7.4 percent in August.
And employers in recent months have been collectively adding almost 200,000 new jobs a month.
In 1999, slightly more than 52 percent of teenagers 16 to 19 worked a summer job.
But by this year, that number had plunged to about 32.25 percent over June and July.
But falling teen employment is just as striking in the 12-month numbers over the past decade.
"Kids that get work experience when they are 17 or 18 end up graduating from college at a higher rate," said Michael Gritton, executive director of the Workforce Investment Board.
Almost every person you ask remembers their first job because they started to learn things from the world of work that they can\'t learn in the classroom," Gritton explained.
Even before the economic crisis exploded in the summer of 2008, workers aged 16 to 19 made up a declining share of the overall workforce.
Another part was that universities now place less importance on work and more on life experiences and community service.
Hall points to a troubling trend within an already worrisome statistic.
These teen employment numbers looks even worse when broken down by race.
In 2000, 61.28 percent of white teens 16 to 19 held a job, a number that fell to 39.25 percent this summer.
Only 9.1 percent of black male teens whose family income was below $20,000 had a job.

Almost every person you ask remembers their first job because they started to learn things from the world of work that they can\'t learn in the classroom," he explained.
Part of the reason was that more teens were going to college.
There are about 16.8 million teens in the U.S. "We have never had anything this low in our lives.

Workers aged 16 to 19 made up less of the workforce even before the job market got really bad in 2008.
But things got a lot worse for teenagers when businesses got hit bad in 2008.
Older workers started taking more of the jobs that teens used to hold.

Arizona on Thursday became the first to specifically require the U.S. citizenship test, a 100-question exam that tests knowledge of facts on subjects like the Founding Fathers, the Bill of Rights and U.S. presidents.
The Arizona law requires high school students to correctly answer 60 of 100 questions on the civics portion of the test for those aspiring to become U.S. citizens.
McConnell said he and others are wary that legislators are only skimming the surface of what students need to know.
The institute says legislatures in 15 states are expected to consider it this year.

When he saw how small the construction site was, crammed between a railroad track and other rides, he knew he would have to do back flips to squeeze shrieks out of his customers.
Goliath is the latest creation in a revolution in roller coaster construction, aficionados say.
Its patented new construction technique manipulates wooden tracks into shapes never before seen, with inversions, over-banked curves and whip-crack reversals of direction.
Roller-coaster lovers are already planning group outings.
The coaster is being built by the upstart innovator in wooden coasters, Rocky Mountain Construction Group, out of Hayden, Idaho.
Before launching the business with his wife, co-founder Fred Grubb was a carpenter and welder building coasters at Silverwood Theme Park in Idaho.
Rather than building tracks on-site, as done in the past, Rocky Mountain cuts, flexes and welds the steel into whatever shape is needed and fastens it to laminated pine in the shop, while curving it to within a sixteenth-of-an-inch margin of error over 40 feet of track.
The company wowed riders last year after it built the new Outlaw Run coaster at Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri.
The workers are used to winter temperatures in northern Idaho that often drop below zero, but even they were taken aback by the latest Chicago winter, one of the worst on record.
Then will come hundreds of test runs, featuring water-filled dummies wearing accelerometers to ensure that riders can tolerate forces exceeding three times the pull of gravity.

Despite the winter work, crew members say building coasters is a lot more rewarding than building an office or a sewage treatment plant.
Replacing the stand-up Iron Wolf steel coaster, which moved to another park, the Goliath will make Great America the wooden roller coaster capital of the world, park officials say, with more feet of wooden track than anywhere else.
"We had to make a crazy ride just to get it to fit on the site."

His mom began reading to Richie when he was an infant.
"I think if I had sight, I would have been able to see all of those people who were there at the spelling bee, and it would have just made things worse," Richie said.
It could be that someone will write his answers for him, or he could use his Braille machine to type them out.
We wanted him to have a regular kid experience," Ann Tienter said.
While the other kids used papers and pencils, Richie read a Braille sheet with the words prepared ahead of time.

Tatiana Poludnitsina fled her home in the eastern Ukrainian town of Luhansk in her robe and flip-flops after artillery shells hit it in mid-August.
With the help of strangers, she crossed the border into Russia, where she now resides in a temporary refugee camp outside the small border town of Donetsk.
An estimated 814,000 Ukrainians have entered Russia since the beginning of the year, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, citing data from Russian migration authorities.
The population dropped to 130 in recent weeks as many refugees found shelter with friends, relatives or host families or managed to rent apartments.
"We wash our hair with cold water," said Yevgenia Melikyan, 35, who arrived at the camp from Luhansk in early August with her 76-year-old father and teenage son and daughter.
Meals include millet porridge enhanced with stewed canned meat.
Most nights the family huddled in the basement of their home terrified by the sound of gunfire and bombs exploding above.
"I wish they could live for one day like we lived, hiding from shelling in the basement," said Irina Pavlenko, 30, who arrived at the camp Aug. 26 with her husband, Maxim; 9-month-old son Kostya; daughter Darina, 5; and other relatives.
A common sentiment conveyed by many of the refugees was that the pro-Russia fighters were ordinary citizens, volunteers who were fighting to protect the lives and interests of ethnic Russians who live in Ukraine.
Word spread and soon friends of friends and strangers were being sent his way.
Dolgopolova said the couple, both former mine workers, sold their wedding rings to pay for bus tickets to Rostov.

Meanwhile, drones are becoming smaller, allowing them to infiltrate spaces that normally would be inaccessible.
They can peek through windows, fly into buildings, and sit, undetected, in corners or other small spaces.
Already, a basic model can be deployed for no more than a few hundred dollars.
Using drones for crop dusting, pollution monitoring, or most search-and-rescue operations is unlikely to raise serious concerns.
Civil authorities should complement these efforts by considering how existing legislation on privacy, data protection, trespassing, and harassment could be used to prosecute operators who infringe on human rights.

Gears may seem like a purely human invention.
And yet the basic interlocking works found inside grandfather clocks and car steering systems have now turned up in the remarkably powerful legs of a certain insect species.
When one leg starts to jump, the gear teeth on that leg engage with the gear teeth on the other so they both push off at the same time.
Crocodile hearts also have a toothed cog valve that may help them stay under water for longer periods by redirecting blood flow to their most vital organs.
"It\'s a wonderful example of the clever solutions that nature comes up with," said Robert Full, a biomechanist at the University of California, Berkeley who was not involved in the study.
An average human can withstand about 5 Gs of acceleration before passing out.
The pair used a high-speed camera to photograph the planthoppers while they jumped.
Each gear strip was about 350 to 400 micrometers long \u2014 about half as thick as a credit card \u2014 with about 10 to 12 teeth in each.
But sending a signal from the brain to coordinate both legs takes time and extra neural bandwidth.
When one leg starts to jump, the gear teeth on that leg engage with the gear teeth on the other so they both push off at the same time.
If the insect had to think about this, Burrows said, it would take one or two milliseconds to send a message from its brain to its muscles.
In other words, the gear method is tens of times faster than a single bug thought.
When one leg starts to jump, the gear teeth on that leg engage with the gear teeth on the other.

"As an alternative, her story is being more fully integrated with that of her spouse \u2014 just like in real life."
Like first ladies before her, Michelle Obama will play an integral role in choosing where the library will go, raising private funds to build it and deciding what it will look like after it is completed.
An exhibit called "Putting People First" highlights her role spearheading the Clinton administration\'s unsuccessful effort to reform health care.

That way, Smith said, libraries can capture the partnership between president and first lady.
Moreover, libraries are doing more to recognize the important roles that first ladies play.

Modern presidential libraries are not just concerned with presidents, however.
After his sudden death, the entire job of establishing his library fell to his wife, Jacqueline.
She put them in a small room where they could be viewed by the public.

But where does everything get stored?
When a president leaves office, a library is built to preserve everything from his time in the White House that is important to history.
This recognizes the important work that first ladies do.
It also helps capture the partnership between the president and first lady.
The history of first ladies and presidential libraries goes back much further.
Today, first ladies are as involved as ever in the planning of presidential libraries.
They are involved in other ways, too.

Bagley said he has never had "a direct death threat," although he has received emails "from people who let me know they own guns, they know how to use them, and I should be careful."
On the other hand, he said, editorial cartooning is "a very dangerous job in most parts of the world," citing examples from Russia to Sri Lanka.
The argument between the federal government and animal advocates over the removal of wild mustangs from the Western range got a bit worse even after the government announced plans to take fewer horses from the land this summer.
They argue that the agency is really favoring the interests of ranchers whose cattle and sheep graze upon the public lands.
"The drought conditions are so severe we\'re going to see die-offs," bureau spokesman Tom Gorey said.
Since early July, it has been supplementing the natural water supplies, filling tubs and troughs with water and providing hay to the horses.
Even with the extra water, the ground does not provide enough water to sustain them, Gorey said.
Six of the Nevada roundups will employ contract helicopters to drive the animals to pens.
The argument between the federal government and animal advocates over the removal of wild mustangs from the Western range got a bit worse even after the government announced plans to take fewer horses from the land this summer.

The U.S. government and animal supporters are still fighting over plans to remove some wild horses from lands in the West.
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) said last week that it would remove 1,300 mustangs in the coming months.
Bureau officials said some animals that are suffering might have to be killed.
But there are far more cattle grazing on the land than there are horses.
They recommended that the government spend money to cut down on the number of mustangs being born.
It should also let nature thin the herds, not spend millions to house horses in crowded holding pens, the study said.

Hurricane and Jordan, a pair of Secret Service dogs who were injured as they helped take down a White House fence jumper, got the all-clear to return to duty Thursday and quickly became stars for the beleaguered agency.
White House press secretary Josh Earnest hailed the duo at a daily press briefing Thursday and the Secret Service tweeted out their service pictures and mini-bios: "Jordan \u2014 black/tan Belgian Malinois, brown eyes, age 5, enjoys walks around (the) White House."
The service began its canine program in 1975 because it was found to be the most effective way of detecting explosives, it says on its website.
The dogs are an "ideal watchdog and guard dog," Animal Planet says, and are "protective of its home and family."
Hurricane and Jordan, a pair of Secret Service dogs who were injured as they helped take down a White House fence jumper, got the all-clear to return to duty Thursday and quickly became stars for the beleaguered agency.
Dominic Adesanya, 23, of Bel Air, Maryland, was charged with two felony counts of assault on a police officer \u2014 the dogs.
Adesanya, who was unarmed at the time of his arrest and was treated at a local hospital for dog bites, was in custody with the U.S.
And Earnest said the apprehension "underscores the professionalism of the men and women of the Secret Service."
The dogs, which the service says are "very sociable," undergo 20 weeks of training with a handler before they begin working.
The dogs stay with their uniformed division handlers 24 hours a day and "become members of the family," the service said.
They stay with their handlers after retirement, generally at about 10 years of age.

Their success was a welcome change for the Secret Service, which has been much criticized for its poor performance during another recent incident.
White House press secretary Josh Earnest hailed the canine duo at a daily press briefing Thursday.
He was also charged with four counts of resisting arrest and unlawful entry and one count of making threats.
His capture after vaulting the fence was a bit of good news for the agency, which has come under heavy criticism since last month, when a man with a knife in his pocket managed to scale the fence.
Fans of Hurricane and Jordan quickly suggested that the doggy duo be awarded a presidential medal.

The Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) are two of the most extreme opposition groups fighting the Syrian government.
Both have been called terrorist groups, and ISIL  has seized large parts of Iraq and Syria.
It is trying to set up a country there, governed by its own strict version of Islamic law.
In recent weeks, ISIL released videos showing the murders of two American journalists and a British aid worker in Syria.

Characterizing their meeting with the NFL about their disapproval of the use of Redskins by the Washington franchise as disappointing, representatives of the Oneida Indian Nation requested a meeting with all 32 NFL owners during Super Bowl week.
The NFL was represented by senior vice president Adolpho Birch, and executive vice presidents Jeff Pash and Paul Hicks.
Since President Barack Obama recently said he would "think about changing" the name if he owned the team, many fans have taken up the cause.
Additionally, as financial sponsors of the league, we are concerned that the league\'s marketing of a racially derogatory term undermines the NFL\'s ability to be a unifying force in America."
Make no mistake,\'redskin\' is a patently racist term."
The Chronicle joins several other publications that have made the same decision over the years, including the Kansas City Star, Slate.com, and the Portland Oregonian, which dropped the term more than two decades ago.

Even the U.S. Patent Office weighed in this year, calling the logo "disparaging."
He thinks the city should continue to include a depiction of a Native American in its official logo.
Of the 900 people who responded, 74 percent picked the logo without the Leni-Lenape tribe member, Hart said.
"We\'re tired of people trying to decide what would offend us," said Autumn Wind Scott, a Ramapough council member and head of the New Jersey Commission on Indian Affairs.
Mayor Frank Bivona said the survey was not a vote but rather a way to gauge opinion, and the final decision will be made by elected officials.
He said he was surprised by the criticism from the Ramapough Lenape Nation, but acknowledged that the borough had not reached out to them about any possible alterations to its logo.

The town of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, has also used a picture of a Native American on its logo for a long time.
Now the town is thinking of dropping the image.
Dwaine Perry, a Ramapough chief, said there is a vast difference between the Franklin Lakes logo and the Redskins trademark.
The first is "a dignified image that represents the native people;" the second is insulting and cartoonish.
For her part, when artist Barbara Lawshe, now 80, found out that Franklin Lakes might update the logo that she designed in the late 1960s, she initially thought: "That\'s fine \u2014 give mine a rest after all these years."
However, when she learned that the Native American figure could be eliminated, her reaction was, "That\'s ridiculous.

"We\'re moving into a period of very unstable weather, and that\'s what producers need to be prepared for," said Jerry Hatfield, a scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
The company produces its forecasts from weather readings at 10 million locations.
And, they say, even farmers who can\'t stomach the words "climate change" or "global warming" will find it useful.
But in the long run, changing environmental conditions pose "unprecedented challenges."
The USDA estimates that wheat production across the Great Plains will drop 6 percent by 2050 because of extreme weather brought on by warming temperatures.
"The variability from year to year is going be greater than it has been in the past," said Charles Rice, a soil expert and professor.
For instance, Kansas State University is leading a $5 million study looking at how to develop a type of wheat that holds up better against the warming effects of climate change.
"Climate has changed, climate is changing," Hatfield said, "and climate is going to change in the future."
Farmers receive field-specific forecasts for rain, soil conditions and wind speed.
Guetterman said he would take some advice from an outside company.
A USDA report this year warned of increasing fluctuation in weather patterns and the effect on crops.
A study by Kansas State University researchers also points to serious problems ahead.
"The producer is going to have to have money in the bank to pay for those poor years."
"Climate has changed, climate is changing," Hatfield said, "and climate is going to change in the future."

Still, scientists and farmers are increasingly planning ahead.

Manning, 25, was accused of the biggest leak of classified information in U.S. history for delivering more than 700,00 pages of documents and videos to the Web site WikiLeaks.
The charges he was convicted of carry smaller sentences that could add up to as much as roughly 130 years in prison, news organizations said.\xa0 On Twitter, WikiLeaks called the possible sentence: "Dangerous national security extremism from the Obama administration."
That charge has not been used against somebody for leaking to the media since the Civil War, the Washington Post said.
Lind did not explain the reasoning behind her verdict.
National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden recently revealed efforts by the NSA to monitor the cellphone and Internet traffic of American citizens.

S. Army Private Bradley Manning was found not guilty of aiding the enemy on Tuesday, the most serious charge he faced for leaking secret documents.
A military judge convicted Manning, 25, of most of the other charges against him, including spying and theft.
He already admitted to other charges.
Manning had access to the documents when he was a junior intelligence officer in Iraq in 2009 and 2010.
Prosecutors also said that Manning wanted to be famous.
Some people were concerned that a guilty decision on the aiding the enemy charge could scare other people who wanted to leak military secrets.
He is  trying to get to another country to avoid facing U.S. criminal charges.
S. Army Private Bradley Manning was found not guilty of aiding the enemy on Tuesday, the most serious charge he faced for leaking secret documents.
The documents included information about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
The U.S. government is currently involved in another high-profile leak case.
Bradley Manning passed along hundreds of thousands of secret papers when he was a private in the U.S. Army.
But the aiding the enemy charge was the most serious one.
Manning was a junior intelligence officer in Iraq in 2009 and 2010.
He only gave out some information.
"We won the battle, now we need to go win the war," David Coombs said of the sentencing hearing, The Associated Press reported.
Lots of people have been watching the case closely.

Not long ago, if the Los Angeles Clippers had wanted to figure out how to best defend Golden State Warriors star guard Steph Curry, they might have sent a scout to a game or watched video clips.
Software tells the cameras what to track, and computer "vision technology" keeps tabs on individual players by the number and color on their jerseys.
Reports based on the combined data are available to teams as quickly as 60 seconds after something has happened on the court, according to Kopp.
Before the start of this season, the NBA formally adopted the technology and made sure all NBA teams had access to it.
Because the SportVU system tracks players over time, it can determine how fast they move, how often they change direction and how much they run during a game.
It can precisely track how well players shoot from particular spots on the court.
In many cases, the data reinforces what coaches already know, experts say.
"You can make adjustments based on that," Sammy Gelfand, the Warriors\' coordinator for basketball analytics, said in an interview.

An unusually large number of whales dining in areas off the West Coast also prized by the fishing industry is contributing to an alarming surge in the number of cetaceans entangled in crabbing gear.
"There are a couple of things going on here, and they\'ve become political," Jennifer Renzullo, a research biologist at the University of California, Davis, said in an interview.
"More fishing pressure," she added, "combined with more whales hanging out in the area are contributing to a spike in entanglements."
Seven others were disentangled and released free of lines.
A task force comprising the fishing industry, state and federal agencies and conservation organizations is attempting to address the problem.
But a coalition of environmental groups led by the Center for Biological Diversity, Earthjustice and Oceana on Tuesday urged the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Fish and Game Commission to make significant changes before the next Dungeness crab fishing season off the West Coast begins in the fall.
New measures under consideration include fishery closures in areas where whales are feeding, use of lines that break away when a trap catches onto a whale, and enhanced efforts to collect lost and abandoned fishing gear.
"It\'s heartbreaking to know so many whales are getting tangled up in fishing gear," said Catherine Kilduff, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity who requested whale entanglement data from NOAA this year.
Over the last four decades, protection and restoration efforts have led to steady population growth for humpbacks.
An unusually large number of whales dining in areas off the West Coast also prized by the fishing industry is contributing to an alarming surge in the number of cetaceans entangled in crabbing gear.
Environmental groups are urging state fisheries managers to implement immediate reforms to protect whales from injury and death.
"For some reason, perhaps because of unusual conditions at sea, humpback and gray whales that tend to migrate through the areas such as Monterey Bay have been spending more time there.
The fate of the remaining entangled whales remains unknown.
The current Dungeness crab season ends June 30.

An unusually large number of whales dining in areas off the West Coast also prized by the fishing industry is contributing to an alarming surge in the number of cetaceans entangled in crabbing gear.
Still, they say the environmentalists have another agenda: using the recent entanglements to pressure the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to keep humpback whales on the endangered species list.
"It\'s heartbreaking to know so many whales are getting tangled up in fishing gear," said Catherine Kilduff, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity.
"About 90 percent of the crabs harvested are caught within six weeks of the season opening \u2014 then the catch drops off exponentially."
He agrees that reforms are needed, but he suggested that environmental groups may be playing up the problem "to assure that humpback whales are not delisted" from the endangered species list.
So far in 2015, at least 25 entanglements have been reported off the coast of California.
In 2014 and continuing this year, there has been an alarming surge in the number of whales getting tangled in crabbing gear.
For more than a year, California state officials, crab fishermen and environmental groups have been watching with alarm as increasing numbers of whales have been getting tangled in fishing gear.
The threats include: pollution and trash, being struck by ships, and entanglement in fishing gear, she said.

For the first time since introducing the device that changed cellphones forever, Apple will offer two distinct versions of the latest iPhones \u2014 a cheaper one made of plastic and another that aims to be "the gold standard of smartphones" and reads your fingerprint.
Apple unveiled the latest iPhone models, available on Sept. 20, during an event at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters.
It will come in silver, gold and "space gray" and run a new chip, the A7 that is up to twice as fast as the A6.
It has a larger pixels and a larger aperture, which helps capture more light.
The phone also has a "true-tone" flash feature that is designed not to clash with the colors in the room or a person\'s skin color \u2014 something Schiller said has not been done on a phone before.
The camera, called iSight, has "auto image stabilization," which helps avoid blurry pictures, and a slow-motion camera for video.

Somewhere in the southern reaches of Miami-Dade County, the only fern of its kind known to grow wild in the continental U.S. survives under a thicket of Brazilian pepper.
More than half, 26, are imperiled or in danger of going extinct.
"Fern enthusiasts like me consider it a small price to pay," Possley wrote for an article about conservation efforts.
First spotted at the Deering Estate in 1962, the rare fern was nearly wiped out about three years ago when the South Florida Water Management District began restoring historic water flow to Biscayne Bay as part of Everglades restoration work.
At three months, they measure about an inch tall, looking a little like parsley.
At about a year, the ferns are finally 2 to 3 inches tall and large enough to be potted and shipped to a greenhouse where Possley and other botanists have been growing about 300 plants representing a dozen rare species.
Fairchild is now working to identify county land where rare ferns would have grown historically so they can be replanted.

The brownhair fern managed to hold on, Possley said.
The fern was discovered in 2006 near Florida City in a location botanists prefer not to reveal.
So two years ago a team led by Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden launched a rescue mission.
With 124 natives ferns, Florida has more species than anywhere else in the United States outside Hawaii or Puerto Rico, Possley said.
Of those, 48 ferns grow in Miami-Dade County.
If the surviving ferns grew in large, protected preserves like Everglades National Park or the Big Cypress National Preserve, Possley would worry less.
The areas are now surrounded by highways, business districts and busy neighborhoods.
Native ferns were once all over South Florida.
They inspired a loyal following among admirers who flocked to fairy-like caves, braving thorny vines and spiders in search of rare species.
The botanic garden was able to reintroduce greenhouse-grown ferns to grow in nature, and the brown-hair fern managed to hold on, Possley said.
Possley would love to see the "little fairy gardens" that once drew tourists replanted, but she recognizes the challenges.
Somewhere in South Florida is a rare fern.
Somewhere in South Florida, an extremely rare fern is barely hanging on in the wild.

Mike Freedman, who is with the botanic garden, spent months tending to the spores.
He made a special container to improve their chances of surviving.
Six weeks after the spores started growing, the ferns remained tiny.
At about a year, the ferns were finally 2 to 3 three inches tall and large enough to be put in pots.

Andre Bauma rolls in the grass with a young mountain gorilla, Ndakasi.
It is believed that there are about 880 surviving wild mountain gorillas in the world, and a quarter of them reside in Virunga National Park.
"I love these gorillas, yeah, and I\'d like to just stay with them forever," he says.
Ndakasi was 2 months old when Bauma found her clinging to her mother, who had been shot through the head.
Besides the mother, six other Virunga mountain gorillas were shot dead with automatic weapons in mid-2007.
That\'s why we have to play with them, to give them food, to sleep together; and they must know they have everything they need," Bauma explains.
Virunga National Park, established in 1925, is the oldest park in Africa, featuring volcanic lava craters, snowcapped mountains, tropical rain forest, misty lakes and the sweeping African savanna.
The British oil company SOCO carried out tests to locate oil in Virunga in 2014.
After strong international criticism, the company said in March that it would give up its right to explore for oil in the park.
We are fighting against corruption," says Mburanumwe.

After the cemetery and humane society officials moved the media herd, the goats ran into the 1.6-acre enclosed area and started doing what they do best: chomping everything green and leafy in sight.
"It\'s actually an ancient custom," said Williams, who\'s trying to be innovative and to bring new life and activities to the cemetery.
"I would not expect that," said Carol Johnson, a National Park Service spokeswoman for National Mall and Memorial Parks.
But, she added, "It\'s certainly an interesting idea."
The floppy-eared brown-and-white goats, including ones called Yoda, Buckaroo and Mimi, were camera-shy at first.
They can reach vines as high as 7 feet, and only cost $4,000 for six days of work, or $9.52 per day per goat.

Using techniques developed by the oil industry, researchers are preparing to set off explosive charges buried in two dozen 80-foot-deep wells drilled around the mountain.
"We\'ve been looking at what\'s beneath the volcano through very fuzzy glasses," said Seth Moran, a seismicity expert with the U.S. Geological Survey\'s (USGS) Cascade Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Washington.

In addition to the explosive testing, specialists in other disciplines are preparing for experiments using enhanced receptors for naturally occurring seismic activity.
The goal is to "see" deep below St. Helens to the area where the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate from the Pacific is forced under the North American plate.
That knowledge, they say, will help them predict eruptions not only at St. Helens but also at other volcanoes in the Cascades and around the world \u2014 and possibly save many thousands of lives.
This Cascade "subduction zone" also is the area that can produce magnitude-9 earthquakes when the plates slip or break.

Steve Malone, now a University of Washington professor, was a seismicity superstar when St. Helens erupted 34 years ago.
He is participating in the iMush studies.
Rainier is considered the most dangerous volcano in America, not for its eruptive force but because of the lahars its eruptions are almost certain to generate.
Moran and other Geological Survey analysts confirmed last month that St. Helens remains active.
But thanks to Malone and others, they were able to roughly predict when the eruption would occur and thereby saved many lives.
The thousands of smaller seismometers that will be used in the explosive testing are slightly smaller than a can of tennis balls.

But when his father died in 2002, Strawn shifted the family business to grass-fed cattle, eventually eliminating the other animals.
"Those animals that are raised in a pen are the cow equivalent of a couch potato," said Strawn, a retired circuit judge.
One thing is clear: Grass-fed meat usually is more expensive \u2014 sometimes twice as much per pound.
Not all brands are certified by the American Grassfed Association, which has strict requirements.
They must never be confined to feedlots or be given antibiotics or growth hormones.
"We need to keep our money in the community," said Maier, a mother of a 10-year-old and a 12-year-old.
She was hoping to find something good to eat on the floor of the truck.
Supporters of grass-fed meat say it has less fat and is healthier than the traditional kind.

Doctors are warning that if Congress cuts food stamps, the federal government could be socked with bigger health bills.
Food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, feed 1 in 7 Americans and cost almost $80 billion a year, twice what it cost five years ago.
The health and financial risks of hunger have not played a major role in the debate.
"If you\'re interested in saving health care costs, the dumbest thing you can do is cut nutrition," said Dr. Deborah Frank of Boston Medical Center, who founded the Children\'s HealthWatch pediatric research institute.
Other research shows children from food-insecure families are 30 percent more likely to have been hospitalized for a range of illnesses.
About half of food stamp recipients are children, and 10 percent are elderly.
Congressional negotiators now are eyeing about $800 million a year in cuts.
According to the Agriculture Department, a family of four receiving food stamps is now getting $36 less a month.
"While this program is an important part of our safety net, our overriding goal should be to help our citizens with the education and skills they need to get back on their feet so that they can provide for themselves and their families," said Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., when the farm bill was on the House floor last summer.
Democrats and anti-hunger groups opposing the reductions have said that cutting food stamps could worsen health and raise health costs for the poorest.
A study published this week helps illustrate that link.
"Critics focus almost exclusively on how much we spend, and I wish they understood that if we did this better, we could save a lot more money in health care costs."
Republicans want heftier cuts than do Democrats.
Most states send out government checks and food stamps at the beginning of the month.
A 300-year-old Stradivarius violin on loan to Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra concertmaster Frank Almond was stolen during an armed robbery after a performance by Almond at Wisconsin Lutheran College, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Tuesday.
As Almond lay on the pavement the robber fled to a nearby vehicle, described as a maroon or burgundy minivan driven by an accomplice, which then left the scene, Flynn said.
"The artistic heritage of Milwaukee was assaulted and robbed last night," Flynn told reporters during the conference at the Police Administration Building.
In a 2008 feature on the violin, Chicago violin dealer Stefan Hersh said the Lipinski violin was comparable in value to another Stradivarius that sold for more than $3.5 million in a 2006 auction.
The violin\'s early owners included the virtuoso Giuseppe Tartini (1692-1770), known to listeners for his "Devil\'s Trill" Sonata.
The instrument has also belonged to Polish violinist Karol Lipinski (1790-1861), whose name has stayed attached to it.

The measure, the most sweeping changes to immigration law since the 1980s, now faces a perilous path in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said flatly: "The House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes.
One by one, senators rose from their seats to declare their votes, as a packed Senate gallery looked on, including an entire section of college students and parents wearing bright blue "United We Dream" T-shirts.
The Senate vote was a robust endorsement to a thousand-page bill painstakingly crafted by a "Gang of Eight" senators from both parties and amended this week to bring in some skeptics.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the spirit of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, who worked feverishly to enact immigration legislation before his death in 2009.
"It reminds us that sometimes we focus so much on how immigrants could change America, that we forget that America changes immigrants even more.
Those eligible could first apply for Registered Provisional Immigrant status, and achieve that status if they pass a background check, have not been convicted of a serious crime, pay any taxes owed and pay a $500 fine.

"Senator Kennedy knew the day would come when a group of senators divided by party, but united by love of country, would see this fight to the finish," Reid said as he closed the debate.
After sailing through the Senate, it now faces a perilous path through the House of Representatives, where Republicans outnumber Democrats.

U.S. President Barack Obama said the world\'s credibility "is on the line" when it comes to punishing Syrian President Bashar Assad for his government\'s supposed use of poison gas.
Obama said a year ago that Assad would be crossing a "red line" if he used poison gas against rebels trying to take his power away.
He was speaking to The Associated Press.
"President Obama hasn\'t been elected by the American people in order to be pleasant to Russia," Putin told the AP.
Putin added, "We work, we argue about some issues.
Some are worried about getting into another war in the area without knowing all the facts, like what happened in the Iraq war.
But the United Nations has to prove that Syria used poison gas.

And her multimillion-dollar effort has put South Florida on the forefront of a national debate over genetically modified foods.
"Consumers have a right to know what they\'re putting in their bodies," said Joshua Eggnatz, Leo\'s Weston-based attorney.
General estimates are that about 90 percent of the corn, cotton, soybeans and sugar beets grown in the United States are genetically altered, and they are most often used in highly processed foods like crackers and cereals.
The FDA has not officially defined what "natural" means in terms of food labels, but its website says the agency "has not objected to the use of the term if the food does not contain added color, artificial flavors, or synthetic substances."
Still, more than 60 countries around the world \u2014 including Japan, Australia and the European Union \u2014 ban or significantly restrict the sale and production of the lab-concocted ingredients, and the companies that make them have felt a stinging backlash in recent years.
Congress is considering a bill that would direct the Food and Drug Administration to "clearly label" genetically modified foods.
The groundswell of public pressure for labels has persuaded Whole Foods to become the first major supermarket chain to require suppliers to add GMO labels to their products, setting 2018 as the deadline.
While the debate rages on, consumers can take certain steps to avoid GMOs without having to rely on labels, accurate or otherwise, Craggs-Dino said: They can buy products certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as organic.

Amid the uproar is a national outcry for mandatory food labels in the United States.
Florida and 14 other states are seeking to require the labels at the state level.

Driving his county pickup through Madera \u2014 just across from Parkwood \u2014 Hoevertsz spotted a sprinkler dousing a green yard, a luxury that could net a Parkwood resident a $75 fine.
A few Parkwood neighbors take the risk, though, their green lawns probably kept verdant with surreptitious watering in the dark, early morning hours.
On Wednesday, the City Council unanimously voted to allow watering of shrubs and trees.
Under the blistering Central Valley sun, Filiberta Sanchez and her toddler granddaughter strolled down a Parkwood sidewalk lined with yellow weeds, dying grass and trees more fit for kindling than shade.
Parkwood is one of 28 small California communities that have since January cycled onto and off of a list of "critical water systems" that state officials say could run dry within 60 days.
"It\'s a sign of how severe this drought is," said Bruce Burton, an assistant deputy director for the board.
Some drilled new wells, built storage tanks or connected their water systems with larger ones and got off the critical list.
Other communities were saved by late spring rains that filled reservoirs and other water supplies.
Fourteen communities, though, remain on the list, approaching a crisis point and trucking in water while they work to find a solution.
But he warned that if the drought continues, larger communities could face their own significant problems.
But the ditch ran dry and, in April, Montague landed on the critical list.
With 62 cabins, the century-old resort has a peak population of about 130 full-time and part-time residents who relied on the Arroyo Seco River for water.

Parkwood is one of 28 small California communities that have since January cycled onto and off of a list of water systems that state officials say could run dry within 60 days.
For some communities, earning a place on the list was the trigger to address problems that some say should have been fixed long ago.
Tim Quinn, the executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies, said communities that have made the list are often small and isolated.
Typically, they relied on a single source of water, such as a stream, without backup sources.
The county warned people to boil well water before drinking or cooking with it.

Some experts thought "casual" games like "Candy Crush Saga" would mean fewer people would buy traditional consoles.
After all, people could play the games in their spare moments on social networks such as Facebook.
The initial buyers of Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are expected to be the most dedicated players.
"We\'ve always said the PlayStation is about the gamer," said Jack Tretton, president and chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment America.
The company talked about it as an all-in-one entertainment system.
Its voice control also lets users seamlessly switch from playing a game to watching a TV show or streaming music or a movie.
PlayStation 4, like the Xbox One, offers access to online movie and TV services such as Netflix and Hulu Plus.
Xbox One, like the PS4, enables players to record, upload and share game play highlights.
Tretton said Sony is working hard to avoid the difficulties that marred the November 2006 introduction of the PlayStation 3.
The game came to market a year after the competing Xbox 360 console.
The PlayStation 3 cost $599 which was $200 more than the top Xbox 360 console.

National parks across the country have been dealing with a decline in overnight stays since the 1980s.
"I think we might be camping more," Kelly Minter said with a laugh.
National Park Service spokesman Jeffrey Olson said the way Americans experience parks changed notably in the last 30 years.
Famous parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite are still full every weekend and require making reservations well in advance, Olson said, but camping numbers may never get back to the highs of the 1980s.
Any decline in camping may be more tied to Americans spending less time away from work than a lack of access to equipment and training.
The large majority of studies have found minimal to no health risks from crumb rubber after testing turf fields, including analyses conducted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the University of California (UC), Berkeley.
Some studies have detected such toxins as benzene and carbon tetrachloride at turf fields, albeit at concentrations low enough to be deemed safe.
On its website, the EPA refers to its study as "very limited" and admitted it is "not possible to extend the results beyond the four study sites or to reach any more comprehensive conclusions without the consideration of additional data."
The law is intended to protect the public and environment from hazardous waste.
A study conducted by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation declared that crumb rubber fields pose "no significant environmental threat to air or water quality and poses no significant health concerns."
UC Berkeley concluded in a research review that "the materials are both cost-effective and safe."
In December, California state Senator Jerry Hill proposed a bill that would prevent cities and school districts from installing them for three years.

"I\'ve been struggling to stay optimistic, to stay encouraged," said Briscoe, married and the father of a 5-year-old son with whom he is working to rebuild a relationship.
Albert Joseph Briscoe III attended grade school in Tennessee, then moved back to Minneapolis with his mother, Debra Haynes, to be closer to his grandmother, who would largely raise him.
"But it wasn\'t cool" to be smart, he said, and the lure of the streets was potent.
His mother struggled financially to raise him and his sister, but she guided them with love.
At 12, Briscoe was arrested for the first time, stopped with one-fourth of an ounce of crack cocaine, which got him a week of juvenile detention.
They\'re so excited to just be around him."
And there is plenty of taking, Sundia said with a laugh.
His probation officer, Kim Peterson, believes in him, but she acknowledges that he faces a difficult road ahead.
Briscoe was a strong student who had the chance to go to top schools in his area.
A pattern began: he would be arrested, charged with a crime, sent to prison.
Briscoe can read, but he started to think about his own children.
Briscoe was facing serious criminal charges that could have put him behind bars for 60 years.
He dug through law books and found an error in the case against him.
Briscoe is now dedicated to pursuing his dream: becoming an independent businessman who encourages young people to read and spreads a message of hope.

He is the father of legendary Colombian matador, or bullfighter, Cesar Rincon, who was famously lofted on the shoulders of his compatriots after four stunning performances in Madrid in 1991.
"I think this is the lowest moment in the tradition," said Rincon, a bull rancher in retirement who lives in Madrid with his father and spends four months of the year in Colombia.
About a dozen bull ranches across the country have gone out of business in the last decade as fewer plazas and small towns host fights.
Before a recent bullfight at la Macarena, a man who gave his name only as Juan G. for fear of threats from aficionados, led a protest.
Policemen on horseback stood nearby, part of a contingent of 110 officers protecting the Plaza that day.
In Colombia, schools also make environmental preservation and understanding of animal abuse part of the curriculum.
In recent years, anti-bullfighting advocates appeared to be gaining the upper hand.
"Politicians have realized that they can win votes by saying they are against bullfighting," said Colombian bullfighter Manuel Libardo, 28.

That was the task at hand as they were preparing to leave for the upcoming Black Sea International ROV Competition and Exhibition in Romania \u2014 the largest underwater robotics competition in Europe.
The top three will be taken out to a real shipwreck, where their robots must retrieve hidden treasure.
The only U.S. team in the competition, they will face high school and collegiate underwater robotic teams from Egypt, India, Iran, Poland, Russia and Romania.
"We went from middle schoolers to representatives of the United States," said Haley.
"It\'s incredible how much your life can change in three months," said Annika Hustard, who recently joined the team and who competed in her first robotics competition in May.
"This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience," said Haley.
Annika said she wants to be a part of "innovation that can help so many people."

"I was 6 months old when I left this country \u2014 I\'m American \u2014 but no one told us if we go to prison we could get deported back to Cambodia," he said, his eyes downcast and his voice filled with anger.
"I didn\'t know anything about any of this until 2011," said Aun Khoy, 51, a deportee who arrived as a teenager in the U.S. and who was deported back to Cambodia two years ago for a decades-old manslaughter conviction.

Most of the deportees arrive in Cambodia with little more than the clothes on their backs and what money they have in their pockets.
"The Cambodian government has enough people to worry about and just isn\'t interested in them," says the center\'s Keo.

In many cities of Xinjiang, the latest outdoors craze is parkour \u2014 a training regimen that started in France and has gone viral worldwide.
Others skoff at propaganda posters, visible all over Xinjiang, that portray the Chinese Communist Party as a unifying force for ethnic harmony.
Similar to martial arts, parkour philosophy emphasizes self discipline and humility, though Jin said his group in Urumqi does not take that to extremes.
Members of the parkour club joke and banter with each other like young competitors anywhere.

The United States braced for a partial government shutdown Tuesday that no one in the seat of democracy seems to want or believes is good for the country, yet the only point of agreement in Washington is that the other political party is to blame.
President Barack Obama and the leader of the Democratic-controlled Senate dismissed a late developing plan approved early Sunday by the GOP-run House that would delay by a year key part of the new health care law and repeal a tax on medical devices, in exchange for avoiding a shutdown.
Social Security benefits would be sent and the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs for the elderly and poor would continue to pay doctors and hospitals.
McCarthy said the House would not relent on demands for "fundamental changes into \'Obamacare\' that can protect the economy."
Democrats say Republicans are obsessed with attacking the overhaul, which is aimed at providing health coverage for millions of uninsured Americans, and the president.

One night after returning from Haiti, Morgan was at the Comet Grill in Dilworth, N.C., talking about how much he wanted to help, but how little he knew about farming.
Then four months later, Powell died of cancer.
"I go out in my yard a few weeks later and mock up what I think we drew up in the drawings," Morgan said.
Morgan and Fleming plan to build a huge garden in an old warehouse in NODA, where they want to open a restaurant, sell vegetables and train graduates of Stonewall Jackson how to do it all.
The gardens here would serve mostly to educate students; the gardens in Haiti would provide dinner.
And a genius, Morgan said, with a working knowledge of hydroponics \u2014 a water-based growing technique similar to aquaponics but without the fish.
"They would come up with some great ideas, and I would figure out how to implement them," said Oliphant, who now works in Arkansas as CFO of Delta Plastics of the South.
The correctional facility had federal grant money to set up vocational programs for students, and Thomas was looking for advice on how to renovate an abandoned greenhouse.

When Esmatullah got engaged in 1999, he was a 26-year-old day laborer eager to wed, through an arranged marriage, a young girl from a village near his native Andkhoy, in western Afghanistan.
Afghan weddings brim with long-standing traditions, and one of them is the custom known as walwar.
For common laborers like Esmatullah, the amount is hopelessly out of reach.
"It\'s basically money that the father gets for selling his daughter," says Mojgan Mostafavi, a deputy minister in the Afghan Women\'s Affairs Ministry.
Rahman, 23, his father and one of his brothers haggled him down to $10,000.
To begin raising the money, Rahman had to leave college and take on day-labor jobs in his hometown of Andkhoy.
Abdullah Rahman got engaged to his 19-year-old fiancee a year ago.

For the 59-year-old woman from a suburb of Beijing, China, it was a shocker: Visiting her new local graveyard, China Dragon Garden, she said she discovered her own name written in gold letters on a black granite tombstone.
Burials are a contentious and lucrative business in China these days.
Shortages of gravesites in Beijing have gotten so severe that the city government doubled subsidies this year for sea burials.
"The demand (for cemetery space) is relatively stable, but prices keep on going up," said Guo Yu, a 25-year-old sales representative at Wanfo Huaqiao cemetery in suburban Beijing, one of the city\'s most prestigious.
Local governments, which control most graveyards in China, earn significant sums from selling plots or allocating land to cemetery developers, making the business ripe for corruption.
The Changping District Civil Affairs Bureau has been investigating the China Dragon Garden case and has put up a sign in front of the facility, deeming it an "illegal cemetery," according to local media reports.
But the Jinghua Times report said the operators also were eager to receive government certification for the facility because approval would qualify the graveyard for certain subsidies.
Ads also noted that even one brother of a Qing dynasty emperor was buried nearby.

Authorities said about half of the 600 tombs at the China Dragon Garden were fakes.

When China landed its first lunar rover on the moon last month, many Americans reacted with a shrug.
After all, the U.S. sent men to the moon more than 40 years ago, and the Soviets landed a rover there too.
In addition, experts say, the Chinese mission is testing new equipment and technology that could be useful for future missions \u2014 manned or unmanned \u2014 not only to the moon but also to Mercury or Mars.
"It\'s like saying you sent probes to the Earth, you looked at small areas of California and New York and now you know everything there is to know.
Stephen Mackwell, director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, noted that the Chang\'e 3 mission landed in an area \u2014 the right eye of the "Man in the Moon" \u2014 distinctly different from previous U.S. and Soviet missions.
Then you can really start moving ahead from what was previously achieved.
It could also help humans design equipment to mine the lunar surface for oxygen and other elements.
"The parts of the moon that have been explored are so minuscule," said Leroy Chiao, a former NASA astronaut and International Space Station commander.
The vehicles are supposed to endure two such long, cold nights during the course of the mission.
So now we\'ll find out if we can do observations from the moon really effectively or it\'s easier to do it another way."
"By the time they get there, it may be 50 years since we did it, and that may not be a big deal.
Hopefully between now and then, we can talk about collaboration."

As it turns out, Mackwell said, LADEE seems to have had enough time to gather some measurements.
Angel Abbud-Madrid, director of Colorado\'s Center for Space Resources, strongly disagrees with those who downplay Chang\'e 3\'s landing as "been there, done that."
He added, "Hopefully between now and then, we can talk about collaboration" with the Chinese.

Another way that GMO foods help us is that they use less pesticide.
As one toxicologist put it, there are more carcinogens in a single cup of coffee than there are in all of the pesticide residue you consume in a year.
Modern-day corn, for example, is the result of genetically modified plantings from thousands of years ago.
Within the last few hundred years, farmers began artificially mating or cross-pollinating plants to increase yields.

In the United States, the glyphosate herbicide currently is sprayed heavily on 84 percent of all GMO crops.
Corn, soybeans, canola, sugar beets, cotton, wheat, beans and rice are all sprayed with it.
And a report by a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last year connected glyphosate to damage done to the human gut and digestive system.
Glyphosate use has also resulted in uncontrollable, herbicide-resistant superweeds on the majority of U.S. farmland.
Meanwhile, the EPA, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have given the green light to a controversial new generation of GMO crops.
A herbicide, Agent Orange, was used to destroy crops and forests  during the Vietnam War.
In addition, billions of pounds of highly polluting chemical fertilizers are added to help crops grow.

There is no scientific difference between GMO foods and regular foods.
Right now, nearly 1 person in every 9 does not have enough to eat on this planet.
One study found that it reduced the amount of pesticides and their costs by more than one-third.
As one put it, there are more cancer-causing substances in a single cup of coffee than there are in all the small amounts of pesticides you eat and drink in a year.
All it means is that there are very few pesticides in what we eat and drink.
They just use modern technology.
Those who wish to buy non-GMO foods can buy organic.
Organic foods are four to eight times more likely to be contaminated with microbes.
The reaction in Syria was notably polarized.
"Events in Syria have been a tragic reminder that there remains much work still to be done," OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu (AKH\'-meht ooh-ZOOM\'-joo) told reporters in The Hague.
He said the $1.2 million prize money would be used "for the goals of the convention" \u2014 to eliminate chemical weapons.
By giving the peace award to an international organization, the Nobel committee highlighted the Syrian civil war, now in its third year, without siding with any of the groups involved.
The fighting has killed more than 100,000 people, devastated many cities and towns and forced millions of Syrians to flee their homes and country.
"If this prize is seen as if the chemical weapons inspections in Syria will help foster peace in Syria and in the region, it\'s a wrong perception," Safi told The Associated Press in a phone interview from Qatar.
"But demolishing the regime\'s chemical weapons alone will not bring peace to Syria, because many more people are dying because Assad\'s troops are killing them with all types of conventional weapons," he said.
After an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds in Syria, Assad faced the prospect of possibly devastating U.S. strikes against his military.
To avert that, he admitted his chemical weapons stockpile and his government quickly signed up to the Chemical Weapons Convention and allowed OPCW inspectors to enter the country.
The first OPCW inspection team arrived in Syria last week, followed by another this week.
They have huge stockpiles of chemical weapons," he told the AP.
An OPCW report this year said the United States had destroyed about 90 percent of its stockpile of the weapons, Russia had destroyed 70 percent and Libya 51 percent.
However, the Nobel committee noted that some countries have not observed the deadline of April 2012 for destroying their chemical weapons.

In its third annual report, released Tuesday, Defy found a majority (62 percent) of 13-to-24-year-olds flock to online video platforms such as YouTube because digital content makes them feel good about themselves.
It\'s because the content that\'s on these platforms is inherently more relatable."
"TV is coming from development execs then creators then producers and then talent performs that content," Tu noted.
Many of those Defy interviewed also said content creators were also more committed than traditional stars.
Some of those surveyed consider YouTubers as their role models.
An estimated 63 percent of all respondents said they would try a product or brand recommended by a YouTube personality versus the 48 percent who reported that they would try a product or brand recommended by TV and movie stars.
Just last weekend, Tu said he was walking around the Grove shopping center in Los Angeles when he spotted an event that featured Vine and YouTube stars.
"Everyone at the Grove over the age of 30 was looking at each other like \'What the hell is going on around here?\'
"They are going to continue carrying these viewing habits and trends as they go along."
"YouTube has a deeper connection because the content comes from the creator."
Tu said the teenager specifically said: "Nicki Minaj is all about making money and I can\'t make money so I can\'t relate to her."

The term "sanctuary city" has become a rallying cry for conservative Republicans seeking stiffer immigration laws.
On July 23, House Republicans passed a bill aimed at punishing cities that refuse to share information with federal immigration authorities, which the White House threatened to veto.
A federal court ruling in Oregon said so-called immigration detainers, which ask local police to hold immigrants suspected of living in the U.S. illegally for up to 48 hours, were not sufficient reason to keep someone in jail.
In 1989, the city passed an ordinance banning officials from enforcing immigration laws or asking about immigration status, unless required by law or court order.
In 2009, it began issuing municipal identification cards that can be used to obtain a public library card and sign up for parks programs.
Places like Cook County, Illinois, and Santa Clara County, California, are trying to cultivate trust of police in immigrant communities.
Last year, a spate of localities that had long worked closely with ICE stopped honoring detainers in response to the ruling in Oregon.
They believe the new approach, combined with a focus on more serious offenders, will lead to better collaboration from local law enforcement.
Smaller city jails like the one in Huntington Beach usually serve as short-term holding centers for misdemeanor arrests.

One of every three bites of food we consume depends on pollination by honeybees, but these overlooked contributors to our food system are continuing to die in stubbornly perplexing ways.
Beekeeping groups have held exhaustive conferences.
Now agricultural and chemical heavyweights are getting into the mix.
"The beekeeping industry has always crawled on its hands and knees to USDA and universities, begging for help," said Jerry Hayes, a bee industry veteran recently hired by Monsanto to run its bee research efforts.
In 2006, beekeepers started noticing that bees were abandoning their hives, a phenomenon scientists dubbed Colony Collapse Disorder.
Specifically and somewhat narrowly, the disorder is being blamed on mites and viruses.
"We have been systematically eliminating flowers that bees require for nutrition and survival," explained Marla Spivak, a University of Minnesota entomologist and one of the country\'s most prominent bee researchers.
The study was prompted by massive bee die-offs that happened in the spring, when corn planters were spewing neonicotinoid-containing dust.
"I know, definitively, that there\'s a relationship between treated seed and spring die-offs," said Christian Krupke, the study\'s lead author.
"It would be a poor business model if we were poisoning the bees we depend on," he noted.
Neal Bergman remembers a seven-year stretch in the 2000s when crop planes doused cotton fields in the Missouri Bootheel with the insecticide malathion.
He says his bee population plummeted, costing him $1 million and almost putting him out of business.
He uses several medicines and gives his hives protein supplements.

"It\'s really one of those moments that really makes what you do special," said Patricia Favero, the conservator at The Phillips Collection who pieced together the best infrared image yet of the man\'s face.
A technical analysis confirmed the hidden portrait is a work the Spanish artist likely painted just before "The Blue Room," curators said.
Since the portrait was discovered, conservators have been using other technology to scan the painting for further insights.
Favero has been collaborating with other experts to scan the painting with multi-spectral imaging technology and X-ray fluorescence intensity mapping to try to identify and map the colors of the hidden painting.
A technical analysis of "La Vie" at the Cleveland Museum of Art revealed Picasso significantly reworked the painting\'s composition.
Curators and conservators revealed the discovery of the portrait for the first time to The Associated Press last week.

Steve Osmek is standing next to a tangle of shrubs and wildflowers, talking about conservation.
As the resident wildlife biologist at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Osmek is in charge of making sure animals play nice with the planes.
"We got into this because we love animals," he said.
As unnatural as all this plastic is, these ponds have a conservation role.
Two years ago, the number of bird strikes at Sea-Tac was especially high; the 121 reported incidents were nearly twice the usual number.
Osmek estimates they take out a couple thousand starlings every year, and their bodies are given to the Burke Museum, which no longer has to buy birds for students to dissect.
At first, airport duty managers would respond any time a single bird showed up on the radar, but by the time they got to the site in their trucks, the bird would be gone.
Steve Osmek is standing next to a tangle of shrubs and wildflowers, talking about conservation.
Plants with berries, nuts and seeds that attract birds are kept to a minimum.
Goats were brought in to mow down the especially pervasive blackberries in 2008, but they were a little too good at their job; they ate all the desirable plants, too.
"Sea-Tac has one of the longest histories of wildlife management," said Ed Herricks, a professor emeritus in civil engineering at the University of Illinois.
In the summer, the ponds can augment low water flow.
Two years ago, the number of bird strikes at Sea-Tac was especially high; the 121 reported incidents were nearly twice the usual number.
Voles, small mammals resembling mice, which had proliferated during an especially wet spring and attracted birds of prey.

More than a century before the Declaration of Independence was drafted, inhabitants of this southern Chinese village erected an elaborate drum tower.

Except for the hottest months of the year, the fire is lighted each morning and kept burning until 10 or 11 each night, Shi said.
Shi is old enough to remember Mao Zedong\'s 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when communist authorities and rabid young Red Guards launched a terrifying campaign to smash the "four olds" \u2014 old customs, old habits, old ideas and old culture.
In Zengchong, a construction crew is hard at work paving the bumpy dirt slope that links the village to a main road that connects to the town of Tingdong, 29 miles away.

On a recent morning, Doreen Alhadeff sat with a roomful of people dedicated to keeping alive Ladino, a centuries-old Jewish language spoken by Jews of Spanish origin, and explained why she plans to become a Spanish citizen.
Most Spanish Jews, also called Sephardic, went to the Ottoman Empire, in what is today Turkey.
It was one of the things that made her feel a deep connection with Spain.
"My parents were born in Turkey," said Ladinero member Marlene Souriano-Vinikoor.
"I feel very strongly that I am Turkish," agreed Ladinero leader Isaac Azose, who traces his roots to the Turkish island of Marmara and said he prefers to honor Turkey as "the country that took us in."
"One of his strengths is his ability to take an apple, bite it and project what\'s going to be popular \u2014 that texture, that crunch, that juiciness.
During their partnership, the program has released six new varieties: Honeycrisp, Zestar!, SnowSweet, Minneiska \u2014 also known as SweeTango \u2014 Frostbite and most recently MN55, which has yet to be given a proper name and will not be available in grocery stores for several years.
As he shares each slice, he points out apples that taste like cloves or cherry Lifesavers, fruit with floral notes or herbal flavors.
He looks for 20 characteristics when sizing up apples, but some traits carry more weight than others \u2014 and appearance is secondary.
He shared his enthusiasm with Bedford \u2014 who in his usual, laid-back way just said, "We\'ve gotta do a little more testing on it."
"We are nowhere near reaching the limit of how far we can go."
"If an apple a day keeps the doctor away, I\'ll live forever," Bedford added with a smile.
On a crisp late fall afternoon, David Bedford plucks an apple from a young tree.
He tosses the apple to the ground, then sprays a stripe of orange paint down the trunk that tells the orchard crew to take it down.
"He\'s our front line, making the decisions about what gets thrown out \u2014 and 99 percent gets thrown out," Luby said.
Jacobson was convinced that MN55 was a winner after tasting one of the red apples in mid-August.

Chicago children returned to school Tuesday, walking past even more guards than last year, when concerns about safety prompted the city to line the streets with 1,200 adults every day.
Thanks to an infusion of $1 million from the city, another 100 "Safe Passage" workers were lining routes that students walk through crime-ridden neighborhoods to get to school.
"It didn\'t happen, to the glory of God, and I think (very little) if anything, happened to children on their way to and from school," said Bishop Larry Trotter of the Sweet Holy Spirit Church on the city\'s South Side, one of several pastors who had urged Emanuel to reconsider the closings.
Chou said not one student was seriously injured along a Safe Passage route during the hours that the guards were on duty last school year.
"She had to get to school earlier than the Safe Passage (workers) were on duty," said state Representative LaShawn Ford, who noted that Safe Passage workers were not on the street at 6 a.m. Ford has pushed for the hours of the guards to be expanded this year.

And after Governor Pat Quinn pledged $10 million, officials said another 600 of the workers would be hired and on the streets over the next several weeks.
His most-talked-about potential rival, Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis, has criticized Emanuel for closing neighborhood schools and dubbed him the "murder mayor" because of the city\'s violence.

There is far less publicity about the first day of school than a year ago.
Over the July Fourth weekend, for instance, 14 people were killed and dozens were injured.
High school students, in particular, go to and from school for clubs and other activities before or after the Safe Passage workers are on duty.

But soon, the list will morph into what\'s being called the Dollar Menu &amp; More, which mixes the standard $1 items in with $2 goods and $5 shareable family meals designed to, as McDonald\'s puts it, "fill the need for choice, flexibility and other preferences."
Restaurants have raised prices to cover increasing food and other costs, hoisting some favorites out of dollar territory.
In the past three years, the number of menu items priced at $1 or less plunged 26 percent at quick-service restaurants, according to a report from the research firm Mintel.
Jerry Brown signed off on raising the [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) in the state to $10 an hour from $8 by Jan. 1, 2016, a move that analyst Gordon said probably will push the quick-service industry to raise the lowest prices to $1.99 from 99 cents.
Health researchers who blame fast food for a plethora of ailments, including diabetes and obesity, have become more vocal in arguing that value menus make such meals even more accessible.
Some formerly loyal customers such as Aesha Adams Roberts would now rather buy a bag of dried beans for dinner than order a 99-cent entree.
Burger King this summer debuted a $1 burger stuffed with French fries, which it touts as "new twists on American classics."

In 2002, he replaced that system with newer technology, but he hit a snag when air-quality standards called for expensive retrofits to reduce air pollution; he eventually shut down the system in 2009.
Then, unexpected pollution problems, regulatory roadblocks and low rates of return killed most such digester systems, leaving only a handful in operation.
"If these digesters run properly, they can reduce odors associated with manure, stabilize nitrogen and have a number of environmental benefits," said John Blue, climate change advisor for the California Environmental Protection Agency.
Manure is fed into a digester, which extracts methane from decomposing organic material, removes impurities and burns it to produce energy.
CH4 technicians will be able to monitor it remotely and will be readily available if it breaks down, Brewer said.
Brewer said he tested his system in other states, such as Wisconsin and Idaho, before shopping it around with California dairy farmers, whom he said were very skeptical.
A decade or so ago, dozens of California dairy farmers built million-dollar systems called methane digesters that convert manure into power.
At the same time, the state is trying out a streamlined permitting process to help remove costly regulatory hurdles.
He said he is optimistic that this go-around \u2014 his third attempt to make a system work \u2014 will finally pay off.
"If these digesters run properly, they can reduce odors associated with manure, stabilize nitrogen and have a number of environmental benefits," said John Blue, climate change advisor for the California Environmental Protection Agency.
That presents a continuing challenge for farmers to dispose of waste and control the methane \u2014 a greenhouse gas \u2014 produced by decomposing manure.
"You have a lot of dairy farmers who put these things on and found themselves willy-nilly in the energy business," said Stacey Sullivan, policy director at Sustainable Conservation, a San Francisco environmental group.
After hearing of the technological and other advances, he decided to "give it another whirl," Koetsier said.

"If these digesters run properly, they can reduce odors associated with manure, stabilize nitrogen and have a number of environmental benefits," said John Blue, a climate change adviser.
He eventually shut down the system in 2009.
He eventually signed his first contract with Koetsier.
And that new system will meet strict air quality rules in the highly polluted San Joaquin Valley.
Those digesters convert manure into power.
Only a handful are still in operation.
"If these digesters run properly, they can reduce odors associated with manure, stabilize nitrogen and have a number of environmental benefits," said John Blue.
Other companies are expected to follow.
But the challenge will be persuading weary dairy farmers to give digesters another try.
Their generators emitted nitrogen oxide, or NOx, which is part of smog.
The current generation of digesters has improved technology.
Ray Brewer, president of CH4 Power, drew Koetsier back to the digester concept.
He promised a new, possibly less risky way of doing business.
And they will be readily available if the system breaks down, Brewer said.

After NASA retired the space shuttle in 2011, the U.S. lost the ability to send its own astronauts to the station, which orbits about 220 miles above Earth.
NASA officials said they were confident they could keep the station in space for years, despite occasional troubles.
For instance, last month a problem with the observatory had to be repaired by spacewalking astronauts.
A December report found that operations on the space station could be kept going through at least 2028.
In its early years, little science was done aboard the station.
Research includes Earth observation, and the study of cosmic rays, which are energy particles that travel through space.
Astronauts have been doing shifts on board the station for more than a decade \u2014 often in six-month intervals.

The International Space Station looks set to get four more years in orbit.
Some have wondered how long the U.S. plans to commit to the station.
Instead of paying Russia, it will hire U.S. companies.
NASA officials said they were confident they could keep the station going for years, despite occasional troubles.
Astronauts have been doing shifts on board the station for more than a decade, often in six-month intervals.
Over that time, the station steadily has built a database of health history for space travelers.

The International Space Station might just get four more years in orbit.
The announcement also could send a signal to China.
It might make it harder for the Chinese to get other countries to be partners in its own space station.

The flight of the [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), dubbed X-47B "Salty Dog 502," could redefine naval aviation.
Landing on an aircraft carrier as it plies the ocean and pitches with the waves is considered an extremely difficult feat for even the most seasoned pilot.
A human pilot would design its flight path and send it on its way; a computer program would guide it from a ship to the target and back.
The drone also has a weapons bay with a payload capacity of 4,500 pounds, but the Navy said it has no plans to arm the aircraft.
The first X-47B had its maiden flight from Edwards Air Force Base in 2011, where it continued testing until last year when it was trucked from the Mojave Desert to Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland.
The U.S. Navy conducted a historic flight test Wednesday off the coast of Virginia when an experimental bat-winged drone made an arrested landing aboard an aircraft carrier for the first time.
The X-47B was controlled almost entirely by computer.
It has a range of more than 2,400 miles and can reach high subsonic speeds.

It also conducted deck-handling and ship-integration testing to demonstrate the capability to safely operate the X-47B on an aircraft carrier flight deck.
There were two X-47Bs developed and built under a contract that has escalated to $1.4 billion.

And on Friday, the southern city of Yulin went ahead with a dog meat festival.
"I was kind of surprised that Yulin went ahead this year," she added.
"In the beginning, it might be just a small group of people who are eating dog meat," wrote one user on Weibo.
Today, members of the MENA community are asking the Census Bureau to create a separate "MENA" category for the 2020 count.
"White," they argue, renders them invisible in official population counts.
"Education is obviously a key point," said Sarab Al-Jijakli, a Brooklyn, New York, community organizer and the president of the Network of Arab-American Professionals.
Since 1980, the Census Bureau has collected data on the growing Arab-American population from an ancestry question on the form.
Counting non-Arab groups such as Iranians, Turks, Chaldeans and Armenians would bring the MENA population up to 5 million, says Helen Hatab Samham, of the Arab-American Institute.
"More of us would identify as people of color.
Currently, the Census breaks down the population into five racial categories \u2014 black, white, Asian, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native and one ethnic category, Hispanic.
Meanwhile, the "East Asian" category separated into selections for Koreans, Filipinos, Japanese and "Hindus," or South Asians.
The stakes were high: Except for freed slaves granted citizenship in 1864, non-whites were not eligible for citizenship for many years.
Because he was born in Lebanon, the United States considered him to be of "Chinese-Mongolian" ancestry and therefore ineligible for citizenship.
The bureau is planning to test a new category in 2015 and 2016.
Categories shift over time," says Akram Khater, director of the Lebanese-American Studies program at North Carolina State University.
Those who are Arab- and Iranian-American are starting to construct this community called MENA that is as real or as false as everything else in this country."
For many Americans, checking the right box on the U.S. census form is a reflex, whether it\'s marking "black," "white," "Hispanic," "Asian," "American Indian" \u2014 or all of the above.
But for Americans of Middle Eastern and North African descent, or "MENA," it\'s a real head-scratcher.
They range in shade from pale to deepest ebony, and come from 22 different countries, from Iran to Egypt to Morocco.

Members of the MENA community are now asking the Census Bureau to create a separate "MENA" category for the 2020 count.
Based on that, there are about 1.6 million Americans of Arab heritage.

Most of Hine\'s caption information included names, but the Lincolnton girl was identified only as a "spinner" at the Rhodes Manufacturing Co. A second photo of her in the same mill with an older girl and a woman also had no names.
Then he came up with the idea of searching the 1910 Lincolnton census and making a list of all white girls who were born about 1898 and had a sister who was about two years older.
He found 12 names, including a girl identified as Lala Blanton.
A Gastonia native and professor of American Studies, Allen found Gaston textile images in the Hine collection at the Library of Congress and in 2008 helped spearhead a multi-part community project exploring that heritage.
The poignant photos shed light on the role of children in the factories.
It became one of the historic pictures among more than 5,000 he made while working for the National Child Labor Committee, documenting abuses of child labor laws in textiles and other industries.

"I never cease to be amazed when I find descendants of people in the photos," said Manning, 72, a retired social worker in Florence, Mass.
Cook, now 50, remembers her grandmother as a "kind, generous, godly woman, but not the quintessential sweet old lady.
"If granny ever mentioned working in a mill, I don\'t recall," said Cook.
Manning and Cook feel confident the little girl in the photo is Lalar Blanton.
She could be tough."
"But I do know she was very protective of children, especially little girls.
Manning became interested in Hine nine years ago through a friend, author Elizabeth Winthrop, when a Hine photo of a young girl in a textile mill inspired a fictional character for her children\'s book "Counting on Grace."
The moving photos shed light on the role of children in the factories.
The haunting image showed a little girl of 9 or 10, staring out a window in the Lincolnton, N.C., cotton mill where she worked.
"It\'s so foreign to us today," said Allen.

Research suggests exercise can increase the size of the hippocampus and increase levels of a protein that aids the growth of new brain cells.
Researchers from the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health also found that people who said they exercised for 30 minutes, five times a week in late-middle age did better on tests of mental performance.
At all ages, active people did better on immediate memory and visual spatial tests and had larger hippocampi than inactive people.
Exercising is important for keeping the body healthy.
Mastering new skills like sitting, standing, walking, running and jumping requires the brain to build new connections.

In the days since a Liberian named Thomas Eric Duncan traveled to the Dallas area from West Africa, became ill and eventually tested positive for the deadly virus that has killed more than 3,000 people in that region, she and others have heard the whispers and taunts.

In the days since a Liberian named Thomas Eric Duncan traveled to the Dallas area from West Africa, became ill and eventually tested positive for the deadly virus that has killed more than 3,000 people in that region, she and others have heard the whispers and taunts.
Woahloe said she got calls from at least two Liberian workers who said colleagues told them they should leave the United States.
Stanley Gaye, president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, addressed a crowd of reporters who had pressing questions: "Do you know the Ebola patient?"
Gaye said the last thing Liberians need is to be stigmatized.
Gaye said the Liberian community had met a month ago with officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Dallas area to learn what they could do for relatives suffering from Ebola back home in the impoverished nation, where health care is substandard and even ambulances are scarce.
"This is more than just about words," said Moore, 45, who fled civil war in Liberia and has lived in Dallas for 14 years.
Ebola is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of infected people who have symptoms, such as bleeding or vomiting.
They will implore citizens who might have come in contact with Duncan to go to the hospital and to contact the CDC.

The city of Salem, which has spent much of the past three centuries both reveling in and atoning for its grim history, plans to install a plaque at the humble spot, according to the Salem News.
Authorities are also seeking funds to clean up the area and ready it for the inevitable tourist traffic.
A doctor diagnosed the cause as supernatural, and under pressure from local officials, the girls blamed three local women for their affliction.
Before long, the "affliction" spread to nearly a dozen girls, and more than 200 people would be accused of witchcraft, according to Smithsonian Magazine.
According to contemporary accounts, she was carted to a spot called "Gallows Hill" for her hanging, as were 18 other accused "witches."
Giles Corey, the 20th person to be executed for witchcraft, was killed via an archaic punishment called peine forte et dure because he refused to enter a plea \u2014 heavy stones were loaded onto his chest until he suffocated.
Pinpointing the spot where 19 Salem "witches" died turned out to be a near-magical investigative feat.
Some believed that the men and women were hanged at the top of a hill in Salem called Gallows Hill \u2014 a sensible conclusion, given the name and the fact that witnesses identified the hill as the execution spot.
So the seven-member Gallows Hill Project team, which included Baker and other Salem scholars, began combing through the documents looking for alternate proposals.
"He must have read every deed and will in the courthouse," author Marilynne Roach, a member of the research team, told the Boston Globe.
The city of Salem acquired that strip of land in 1936 "to be held forever as a public park" and called it "Witch Memorial Land," according to a press release put out by Baker.
There are no artifacts to be found there, no buried remains \u2014 the soil was too shallow for burials, Baker told Reuters.
And the academics who found the site of their last breaths will have the satisfaction of a mystery solved.
Then, even as Bishop protested her innocence, the ladder was kicked out from under her.
Bishop was the first of 19 people to be hanged in this spot, more than 300 years ago, during the months of paranoia and pain that were the Salem witch trials.

In Salem, Massachusetts, the morning of June 10, 1692, started with a hanging.
Bridget Bishop was a local woman convicted of witchcraft.
Her hands were bound behind her back, and her legs and petticoat were tied tight.
It allowed everyone in town to witness "an example of what happens to people who break the law," said historian Emerson "Tad" Baker, a member of the Gallows Hill Project, which has identified the location of the gallows.
People come to Salem from all over wanting to know where the hangings happened, said Kenneth Glover, who gives tours in Salem.
Now he can tell them, if he wants to.

"And I think that becomes even more painful when you\'re separated from your family."
The friends she does have in Mexico are almost all recent returnees from the U.S., many via deportation.
She fantasized about attending the University of Missouri or Indiana University and studying journalism or international relations.
She ended up finding a job at a call center, one of thousands where telephone and cable companies, among others, hire Americanized migrants to take customer service calls from the United States at Mexican wages.
"I guess I should have stayed," Pinzon told her flatly.
"It would have just taken me two years," she said.
"The two years I\'ve been doing this, I could have been doing it there."
In the spring of 2010 as she was about to graduate from high school, Pinzon felt she had two choices.
At first, Pinzon spent much of her free time on Facebook and Skype, up to eight hours a day.
Until she found them, she felt as if no one in this massive city understood her homesickness.
Pinzon entered the seventh grade at Oxford Middle School in Overland Park, a suburb of Kansas City, Mo.
Later, at Blue Valley Northwest High School, she joined the yearbook committee, sang with the chorus and danced with the Dazzlers drill team.
She still hopes to attend college in Mexico.
Pinzon was 17 and living in the United States illegally.
Her family has been divided by the consequences of the U.S. immigration policy.
"I felt like I was the only one who was going through this situation."

She is one of around 500,000 Mexicans ages 15 to 32 who returned to their homeland from 2005 to 2010.
She ended up finding a low-paying job at a call center, where she answered the phone all day.
But going back to the United States illegally is also a possibility, she admits.
Blame your Facebook account if you feel down on a bright, sunny day, according to new research.
The research may have significance for a world increasingly connected by the Internet.
On the other hand, posts that expressed negative emotions like anger or sadness caused more negative posts.
The paper was published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.
said lead study author James Fowler.
"What people feel and say in one place may spread to many parts of the globe on the very same day," authors wrote.
Fowler and study co-author Dr. Nicholas Christakis have written papers about how things spread through networks of friends and acquaintances.
Russell Lyons, a professor of mathematics at Indiana University, criticized another paper by them.
People naturally tend to express their feelings rather than hide them.
Laughter, for example, may come from the "play face" expression seen in apes when they are relaxed.
A wave of good feelings would be the result.

Similar die-offs have occurred before, but an event of this magnitude has never been documented, scientists said.
In Alaska, evidence of sea star wasting was first observed last summer on Kayak Island, a remote island in the Gulf of Alaska, Raimondi said.
On the island, a number of diseased sea stars were discovered, trumping an earlier theory that the illness was linked to warmer water, Raimondi said.
"It was the last place on earth where we would have expected to see it," Raimondi said.
Nicole Abeln, the animal care technician, pulled out a white binder labeled "Sea Star Wasting Disease Information and Logbook."
Symptoms ranged from white lesions of the arms to a sea star that lost two arms during the day.
"We\'re in the same mystery boat as the rest of the world," he said.
These symptoms are actually seen all the time, he said, and are attributed to stress, such as a starfish drying out or getting sick.
The science so far appears to indicate that species are affected differently depending on physical location.
For sea star species in tide pool areas, the lesions or sores show up, followed by tissue decay, Raimondi said.
Death might follow in a matter of weeks, or not at all.

On a recent morning, Anchorage Museum curator Greg Danner walked into a back room where sick animals are isolated for treatment and care.

Sea star wasting syndrome has been reported as far south as San Diego, nearly 2,500 miles away from of Anchorage.
In Alaska, evidence of the disease was first observed last summer on Kayak Island, a remote island in the Gulf of Alaska.
And at that point, the illness started showing up all over the West Coast, Raimondi said.
Nicole Abeln, the animal care technician, pulled out a white folder labeled "Sea Star Wasting Disease Information and Logbook."
One entry from a trip to Whittier on Aug. 25 reports they found "one mottled sea star twisted and looking deflated."
That sea star was beyond recovery and was so ill that the scientists eventually killed the animal to stop its suffering.
The museum put to death a total of eight sea stars in similar situations between August and November.
Symptoms ranged from white patches on the arms to a sea star that lost two arms during the day.
Raimondi said the symptoms are more present in starfishes kept in captivity.
He also said that the term "wasting" describes the symptoms of the disease.
But Raimondi explained that the sea stars are now getting the disease in the wild and in places where they naturally belong.
These are not unlucky animals that have been washed up on a beach but starfish in their normal environment.

Washington state and federal officials have also been discussing building about 50 "tsunami safe havens," such as artificial hills that could hold as many as 800 people.
More than 100 bridges would be lost, power lines toppled and coastal towns isolated.
Officials in Northern California, Oregon and Washington are beginning to address the dangers.
In 2011, a 9.0 earthquake created a huge tsunami in Japan that swept through coastal areas.
That tsunami took residents by surprise.
It killed more than 10,000 people and left more than 300,000 homeless.
During the 2011 Japan tsunami, scientists underestimated its size and did not anticipate the massive damage it would do.
One building at an elementary school in Washington state will be able to protect 1,000 people with a high wall.

Scientists had believed that the Cascadia fault zone could only produce a 7.5 earthquake.
On March 16, a small quake caused by the Cascadia fault erupted 50 miles off the coast, causing moderate shaking.
A giant tsunami along the West Coast would wash away coastal towns, destroy U.S. Highway 101 and cause $70 billion in damage.
One building at an elementary school in Washington state will be able to protect 1,000 people with a high wall.
The Cascadia fault is powerful for two reasons.
Second, it is an area where two huge tectonic plates are being pushed under the gigantic North American plate.
Once every couple hundred years, the North American plate snaps back upward like a rubber band, creating a powerful earthquake.
It could be 100 years from now," U.S. Geological Survey seismologist David Oppenheimer said.
They hope to learn lessons from a recent disaster in Japan.
They hope that new tsunami detectors deep under the ocean can provide early warnings of a wave.
To escape a tsunami, people must flee to high ground such as a hill or mountain.
One building at an elementary school in Washington state will protect 1,000 people with a high wall.
These earthquakes can cause a tsunami, a huge wave that rushes into coastal cities.
The Cascadia fault is made up of three tectonic plates that are pushing against each other.
Scientists worry that a strong earthquake off the coast of California could do major damage to the West Coast.
Officials in California, Oregon and Washington are now making plans to prepare for an earthquake and tsunami.

The grand opening is expected by the end of next year or in early in 2016, perhaps during Black History Month, though for Bunch, "every month is Black History Month.
And for the Smithsonian, it\'s going to be for millions of people."
Officials with the museum, part of the Smithsonian Institution, say that they have raised approximately $400 million toward the $500 million cost of the museum, with more than $160 million coming from private sources.
A significant contribution \u2014 $12 million \u2014 came from media mogul and actress Oprah Winfrey, who will have a theater inside the museum named in her honor.
"By investing in this museum, I want to help ensure that we both honor and preserve our culture and history, so that the stories of who we are will live on for generations to come," Winfrey said last year.
Mall advocates, from Congress to the National Park Service to arts experts, seem to agree that nothing more can be placed along the nearly two-mile corridor from the U.S. Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial without detracting from the green space and the existing array of museums and memorials.
The Smithsonian will use its empty Arts and Industries Building for a National Museum of the American Latino, still awaiting congressional approval.
Phil Freelon, the African-American architect from Durham, N.C., who designed the building, imagined an angular, three-tiered boxlike structure with 10 stories \u2014 five above ground, five below.
"The skin of the building," Bunch said, calling the overall design "an homage to those hiding in plain sight."
Bunch, who went up in a hydraulic cherry picker to see the views for himself, said, "We wanted to have that right tension of the building and one of the most sacred spaces in America."
It serves as a compelling example of how the Jim Crow-era segregation laws separated blacks and whites in public facilities.
"This rail car \u2026 is a tangible remnant from America\'s long years of segregation, and those remnants are rare," said Peter Claussen, the chairman and CEO of Gulf &amp; Ohio Railways, who donated the rail car to the museum and who\'s also a member of the Smithsonian National Board.
But as Bunch raised money and developed the collection, he had to make sure people believed that the museum would be built.

But for a brief few weeks this summer, he gets to lead cicada tours, hold cicada parties, plan cicada movie festivals, and even eat cicadas, coated in flour and panko, then pan fried.
"We have a pair of mating cicadas on this plant over here," he shouts back to the dozens of hapless New Yorkers following him through the mud to observe the bugs.
The pilgrims thought that cicadas were locusts, like in the Bible.

The FBI is deploying agents and technical experts to assist in investigating the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jet, based on the American citizenship of three of the passengers aboard the lost flight, a top federal law enforcement official in Washington said Saturday.
U.S. officials said they are looking at whether this could be terrorism, as they would with any plane crash until proved otherwise.
Although two passengers apparently used stolen passports, "there is no indication this is a terrorist attack; stolen passports are certainly not indicative of a terrorist attack," a senior counterterrorism official said.
Law enforcement officials were not authorized to speak publicly.
An official at the Department of Homeland Security said it would be a first if the plane was brought down by two terrorists who boarded the jet carrying stolen passports.
He noted that in the United States, passports and other travel documents are immediately run through a computer database that would have detected whether they had been stolen or lost.
The Homeland Security source said that the passport stolen from an Italian was taken from his rental car when he returned the vehicle in August in Malaysia.
But the jetliner that disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing did not have a U.S. leg on its itinerary.

On January 18, the New England Patriots beat the Indianapolis Colts 45 to 7, earning the chance to play in the Super Bowl.
According to experts, this could have been an advantage for the Patriots, because underinflated footballs are easier to throw and catch.
For his part, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick says his team did not do anything wrong.
"We feel like we followed the rules of the game to the letter," he added.
The balls were inflated in a warm room by NFL officials and then used in the game, which was on a cold, rainy day.
After they were taken out of the room, and into a colder environment, there would be an even bigger drop in temperature, and a bigger drop in air pressure.
During halftime, the Colts claimed that the balls used by the Patriots offense were underinflated, and NFL officials tested them.
This was not the first time that the Patriots have been accused of cheating.
And I\'m proud of this team," he added.
"We feel like we followed the rules of the game to the letter," he said.
I\'m not an expert," Belichick said.
Others were suspicious of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.
In the near-term, Young said, he could envision hunters being able to use drones to drive wildlife to them or to locate wildlife beforehand and then go to that spot to hunt.
"So the use of drones would basically reduce the element of fair chase, which is an important principle of hunting," Young said.
"I believe in doing things the old way, and it\'s not hunting to me if it\'s too easy," said Bostic, 56.
Linda Estrada, president and director of Animal Welfare League in Chicago Ridge, Illinois, said she also agreed with banning drones to hunt.
Scouting involves exploring a possible hunting area ahead of time to gather information on animal whereabouts, herd or flock sizes and best potential hunting vantages.
Jason Parent, a New Hampshire state legislator who co-owns a hunting guide service, has been a vocal proponent of being able to use drones for scouting in his state.
He likened using drones for scouting to other surveillance devices, such as stand-alone cameras that hunters use to watch for animal activity or tree stands that allow hunters to see an area from a better vantage point.
In keeping with the fair chase doctrine, Illinois already outlaws such conduct as using ferrets to frighten or drive mammals from their dens or hiding places; having dogs pursue, harass or kill deer; using lights connected to a vehicle to hunt at night; baiting deer and turkey; and shooting most birds when they are not flying.
Using any computer software or service to remotely control a weapon that takes wildlife \u2014 or so-called long-distance hunting \u2014 is also banned.
The hunter could be charged with a Class A misdemeanor.

When it comes to hunting, Illinois already takes several steps to preserve what is known as "fair chase," or giving animals a chance against hunters.
The proposed law would build on existing Illinois law that prohibits using drones to interfere with hunters or fishermen and restricts their use by law enforcement.
Morrison decided to propose the legislation after talking to officials at the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.
Chris Young, a spokesman for the department, said the Illinois conservation police have not yet received complaints or reports of anyone using drones while hunting.
"So the use of drones would basically reduce the element of fair chase, which is an important principal of hunting," Young said.
Other states, including Montana, Alaska and Colorado, have already restricted the use of drones in hunting.
John Bostic, who owns a business guiding hunters, has been hunting for more than 40 years.

So he was interested when Marine recruiters showed up in 1942, seeking young men like him who knew both English and Navajo.
That day, four months after Japanese bombs fell on Pearl Harbor, Nez helped form an elite, top-secret group that became known as the Navajo code talkers.
For 13 weeks, Nez and the others were confined to a room at the base where they were instructed to come up with words to represent the letters A to Z, as well as a code for military terms.
Messages that had taken 30 minutes to code and decode using other systems were translated and deciphered \u2014 decoded \u2014 in 20 seconds by the Navajo code talkers.
If Chester Nez dared to use his Navajo language in school, punishment was swift.
He had to scrub his tongue with a toothbrush and wash out his mouth with bitter soap.
So he was interested when Marine recruiters showed up in 1942, seeking young men like him who knew both English and Navajo.
Using the Navajo language, they developed an unbreakable military communications code.
One of five children, Nez was born in 1921 in Two Wells, New Mexico.
When he was about 9, his struggling father packed him off to government boarding schools to learn English and other skills that might help him succeed among whites.
The Marines showed up at his high school in Tuba City, Arizona, in the spring of 1942.
It was there that they learned just how challenging their assignment would be.
The Japanese had already broken every code used by the Allies.
In many respects, Navajo was perfect for the task: It had no written form, its grammar was complicated and it featured unusual sounds that added another layer of difficulty.
For 13 weeks, Nez and the others were confined to a room at the base where they were instructed to come up with words to represent the letters A to Z, as well as a code for military terms.
He was at the Battle of Bougainville in New Guinea in November 1943, Guam in July 1944 and Peleliu and Angaur in September 1944, sending and receiving messages.
"I worried every day that I might make an error that cost American lives," Nez told CNN a few years ago.
Not even another Navajo could decipher it if he wasn\'t a code talker."

Those movements first emphasized in gym \u2014 skipping, lunging, twisting, jumping, stopping and starting \u2014 are the building blocks of high-performing athletes.
"And as we learned the alphabet we learned how to put two letters (together) and then three and then four to form words, and pretty soon we had a word, a sentence, a paragraph, a chapter, a book.

There\'s something wrong about that," he said.
Scientists from China and Massachusetts think they know what was responsible for the largest extinction our planet has ever seen.
To figure out exactly which kind of microbe might have been responsible, Rothman took his research to Fournier.
The new gene allowed it to produce methane more efficiently than ever before.
The researchers cannot say for certain that the microbe and the vast quantities of methane it produced were responsible for the end-Permian extinction.
Still, they do have one more line of evidence to support their hypothesis.
Scientists from China and Massachusetts think they know what was responsible for the largest extinction our planet has ever seen.
The microbes discussed in the study were so small, that 1 billion of them could fit in a thimble-full of dirt found on the ocean floor.
Despite their size, they were almost responsible for killing off all the life on our planet, the scientists suggest.

The researchers cannot say for certain that the microbe and the vast quantities of methane it produced were responsible for the end-Permian extinction.
"Our proposal is unusual, but it does bring together many observations, and ties a lot of stuff together," Rothman said.
About 252 million years ago, long before there were even dinosaurs, most of the living things on Earth died.
Scientists call this event the end-Permian extinction.
Microbes are very small living things that can only be seen through a microscope.
These particular microbes were so small, that 1 billion of them could fit in a thimble-full of ocean dirt.
Scientists say that nearly nine-tenths of all life on Earth was destroyed during that time.
There was a quick increase of CO2 levels at the time.
Some scientists have suggested an asteroid could be to blame.
They blame a tiny microbe called Methanosarcina that puts out methane gas.
MIT scientist Dan Rothman was looking at how carbon levels grew during this time and found the first clue that microbes could have been involved.
It was a rapid upward curve.
The new gene allowed it to produce methane more easily than ever before.
The researchers cannot say for certain that the microbe and the huge amount of methane it produced were responsible for the end-Permian extinction.
Inside the gallery, artworks by Syrian artists were drawing auction bids from collectors.
The Syrian refugee diaspora \u2014 now at 2 million and growing \u2014 has fanned out across the region and beyond for more than two years from tent camps in Jordan to others trying to rebuild lives in cities such as Beirut and Istanbul.
"It\'s a tragedy what is happening there now, but it would be an even bigger tragedy if all this art and culture that Syria has so much of would be lost," said Hisham Samawi, whose Ayyam Gallery moved from Damascus to Dubai in late 2011 as the Arab Spring rebellion widened.
A signed copy sold for $12,000 at the auction, attended by more than 300 people.
"The artists are paramount so we had to get them out," said gallery owner Samawi.
He said there are plans to try to bring other Syrian artists out of the country, but the efforts are made more complicated by the deepening battles and the increasing lockdown atmosphere in Damascus over threats of possible U.S.-led military action.
Meanwhile, Ayyam crews managed to ship about 3,000 paintings, sculptures and other pieces as fighting intensified in the Syrian capital.
The image became an Internet sensation with hundreds of thousands of views and established the 33-year-old Azzam as one of the artistic voices of the civil war.

In a pre-calculus class at John Champe High School in Loudoun County, Virginia, juniors and seniors are learning abstract mathematical concepts.
And in a personal-finance course, 16- and 17-year-olds are learning about something that might seem even more abstract for the teenagers: retirement.
Results from the 2012 Program of International Student Assessment showed that U.S. teenagers were in the bottom half for financial literacy among the 18 countries that participated, ahead of France and Spain, but below Latvia, Russia and China.
An economics and personal-finance class is now a required course for those who want a high school diploma in Virginia, and the Class of 2015 was the first that needed the course to graduate.
Northern Virginia now has one of the best personal-finance education programs in the country, according to Working In Support of Education, a New York City-based nonprofit that designs personal-finance curriculums for high school students.
One student hoped to add another Advanced Placement course to her schedule, which she thought could make her more competitive for colleges looking for students with challenging course loads and could give her a chance to earn college credit ahead of time.
In the class, taught by former lawyer Mary Doherty, students are slated to learn about personal-finance issues that could affect them at nearly every stage of their lives.
They will learn about the potential pitfalls of using credit cards and how to be judicious about spending and budgeting.
They also will learn about applying for college loans and the cost of higher education, something that is imminent for many of them.
And they will learn about various kinds of retirement accounts, something long on the horizon but that many experts believe is a vital topic that many people put off until too late.
"This class is like a wake-up call," said senior Lainie Gibbs, 17.
Teacher Toni Fasan, a former banker, said the biggest jaw-dropping moment for her students is when they do a budgeting exercise, learning how much it costs to raise a family in affluent Loudoun County.

The guy in charge might have a doctorate in organismal biology and anatomy, as does Christian Sidor of the Burke Museum.
They had uncovered about 7 feet of it at the South Lake Union apartment complex construction site where it was found Tuesday and speculate that the tusk might be 3 or 4 feet longer.
Eventually, people will be able to view the tusk at the museum and hopefully learn about life in the Puget Sound region when it resembled an Arctic plain.
Right now, Sidor said, before carbon dating will be done, he figured the tusk was probably 22,000 years old, and maybe even 60,000 years old.
He figured the region had three or four herds of the mammoths, with each herd consisting of 30 to 40 animals.
But Koppelman said "community involvement is very important" to the company.
He said scavenger animals would have eaten most of the mammoth, but not the tusk because it had no nutritional value.
On the east side of the construction site is the backside of a building housing the Bright Horizons Child Care, which had a small outdoor walkway.
The kids and staffers certainly hoped more of the mammoth would be found, talking about how neat that would be.
There is nothing as complete as this," he said.
There are no state or federal laws that would have prevented AMLI from going ahead with construction and destroying the tusk.
He said scavenger animals would have eaten most of the mammoth, but not the tusk because it had no nutritional value.
The staffers made plans to make sure to watch at 4 p.m. Friday, when the tusk is expected to be lifted up.
He planned to work through the night, if necessary.
Eventually, people will be able to view the tusk at the museum, where it will help them learn about life in the Puget Sound region when it resembled an Arctic plain.
The property where the apartment complex is being constructed is owned by AMLI Residential.

But then the company "realized the benefits far outweighed the cost," even if it meant some construction delay.
The tusk was found Tuesday at a construction site for a block of apartment buildings.
Sidor thinks that the whole tusk might be 3 or 4 feet longer.
It will help them learn about life in the Puget Sound region back when it resembled an Arctic plain.
Right now, Sidor said he could only make a guess as to how old the tusk is.
He figured the tusk is probably 22,000 years old \u2014 but it could be as much as 60,000 years old.
Still, Thursday afternoon he and three other museum staff members were in the ground 30 feet below street level.
About 7 feet of it had been uncovered so far.

The $280 million moon-orbiting mission will last six months and end with a suicide plunge into the moon for LADEE.
NASA hopes to eventually replace its traditional radio systems with laser communications, which would mean faster bandwidth using significantly less power and smaller devices.
"There\'s no question that as we send humans farther out into the solar system, certainly to Mars," that laser communications will be needed to send high-definition and 3-D video, said NASA\'s science mission chief, John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut who worked on the Hubble Space Telescope.
It was a momentous night for Wallops, which was making its first deep-space liftoff.
He speculated the wheels may have been running a little fast.
Worden stressed there is no rush to "get these bugs ironed out."
The military-NASA Clementine rocketed away from Southern California in 1994.
The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer or LADEE, pronounced "LA\'-dee," is taking a roundabout path to the moon.

S ANGELES, Calif. - In one photo, a tourist in a baseball cap stands heroically, raising a 340-ton boulder above his head.
The ball was only 5 feet from the hole, but when golfer Chey Castro raised his putter for what should have been a clean shot, his hand spasmed.
"I know I\'m good, and I know I can make these putts," says Castro in a call from his home in Arizona.
Castro first experienced the yips more than 10 years ago.
Castro, 37, says the reason is a lack of confidence.

The elusive Sierra Nevada red fox was recently spotted in Yosemite National Park for the first time in nearly 100 years.
The sighting of the red fox \u2014 one of 14 mammals protected by California \u2014 was captured by motion-sensitive cameras on Dec. 13 and Jan. 4.
Park officials are still trying to determine whether the cameras caught the same fox or a second one.
Little is known about the creature because sightings are so rare.
Determined to photograph the creature again, park wildlife biologists placed cameras in Tioga Pass, where the fox was seen years earlier.
The small animal was filmed biting on a bait bag containing chicken scraps.
University of California, Davis researchers analyzed saliva samples from the bag and confirmed its DNA was that of a Sierra Nevada red fox.
Two years ago, Cobb said, she and her husband spotted one of the foxes during a deer hunting trip near Sonora Pass.
Researchers will continue using remote cameras to look for the Sierra Nevada red fox.
Yosemite\'s vast landscapes are providing a protected habitat that would allow the Sierra Nevada red fox to possibly "make a comeback," she said.
The last time a red fox was seen at Yosemite was in 1915, she said.
Two years ago, Cobb said, she and her husband spotted one of the foxes during a deer hunting trip near Sonora Pass.

Many middle school students in south-central Alaska spent spring break playing video games, skiing in what little snow has fallen or just enjoying a lazy week away from school.
Grayson Davey, an eighth-grader, spent most of his week off looking for employees.
The fire starter bracelet looks like many other woven bracelets being sold online to outdoor enthusiasts.
When unraveled, the fire-starter bracelet reveals not only 17 feet of military-grade paracord, but also a piece of firesteel and a striker that can be used to start a fire.
"When your adventure goes awry, what you have on you is your survival kit," he said.
Since he began making them in 2013, at the age of 11, Grayson has sold more than a thousand of his fire-starter bracelets and fire bugs, a version that connects to a keychain and contains a mylar signal mirror and X-Acto knife.
Over spring break, he identified two potential employees, and he is looking for at least three more.
"I want to grow the company as big as I can and at least get enough money for college," he said.
Grayson is not alone in his youthful entrepreneurship.
People who work with the group, and other entrepreneur organizations, claim that more and more young people are looking to be their own boss and not go to work for someone else.
Three years later, Grayson owns his own company, and he is selling his expanding product line on the Web and at several local stores.
I knew it is a growing niche.
He was looking into hiring home-bound people who want to pick up work and can learn the intricate weaving pattern needed for the designs.
Grayson predicts his new employees could make $15 to $20 per hour, working part time.

To be clear, the report was revealing only in its raw detail of CIA activities against particular detainees, not in the broad subject matter.
In fact, when news surfaced years ago that the CIA deprived suspects of sleep, chained them to walls, threatened them with gruesome death and so on, government officials, opinion leaders and the broad public began a serious and cathartic national debate over whether the United States should ever torture.
Feinstein says that she hopes the report will serve as a warning for the future, as a preemptive measure to ensure that, even when facing national security perils, the United States never again abandons its values.
Now, the extremists of al-Qaida, Islamic State and other dangerous groups who plot every day to attack America and its global interests will have one more rallying cry and recruiting tool.
Now, governments and intelligence agencies with which Washington has worked regularly, whether in Europe, the Middle East, or elsewhere, will hesitate before aligning themselves too closely with the United States.
What has augmented the ranks of those inclined to cause harm to Americans is the torture itself, not its description in the Senate report.
It is all these actions taken together that make us an attractive target for a new generation of extremists.
Even today, we stand practically alone in refusing to acknowledge Palestine as a nation-state, and in protecting Israel in the U.N. Security Council.
To be clear, the report was revealing only in its raw detail of CIA activities against particular detainees, not in the broad subject matter.
That means more extremists with more motivation to plot and launch more attacks against more Americans.
Despite gruesome details included in the report about what was done to detainees, the release is not likely to lead to any immediate increased risk to Americans.
It is all these actions taken together that make us an attractive target for a new generation of extremists.
A federal statute incorporates the U.N. Convention Against Torture, making torture committed anywhere in the world a crime.
That means more extremists with more motivation to plot and launch more attacks against more Americans.
It gives extremists one more rallying cry to attack U.S. interests and strengthen their recruiting efforts.
At the time, government officials, opinion leaders and the broad public began a serious national debate over whether the United States should ever torture.
Yet, as the Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Diane Feinstein acknowledged in the report, the days after Sept. 11  were ones of overwhelming fear that much greater attacks were coming.
She went on to say that the "Intelligence Committee as well often pushes intelligence agencies to act quickly in response to threats and world events."
During the Civil War, for instance, President Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus, which prevents Americans from being unlawfully imprisoned.
She hopes it will ensure that, even when facing national security perils, the United States never again abandons its values.
It is no secret that the CIA used techniques amounting to torture in its interrogations after Sept. 11, 2001.
He was captured in Pakistan in 2002 and believed to be a member of al-Qaida, the group behind the Sept. 11 attacks.
He was tortured in Poland at a "black site" the Polish government let the CIA use.
Yet, the Senate report says it did not result in any significant information from him.
The torture was part of an overreaction to Sept. 11 that included the mistake of invading Afghanistan.
It is all these actions taken together that make us a target for a new generation of extremists.
Our continuing position in the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians does not help.

Now the details of this disturbing report have been splashed across TV screens, newspapers and websites.
At the time, the government and the American public began a serious national debate over whether the United States should ever torture.
An obvious situation is if the United States faced the immediate threat of an attack that could kill hundreds or thousands of people.
During the Civil War, for instance, President Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus.
But extremists plot every day to attack America.
That means more militants with more motivation to plot and launch more attacks against more Americans.
We rely on intelligence information from our allies in Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere.
Despite those, the release is not likely to lead to any immediate increased risk to Americans.
It is no secret that the CIA used torture in its interrogations after Sept. 11, 2001.
What causes extremists to want to harm Americans is the torture itself.
The interrogation methods had already been called torture around the world.
Last summer, the European Court of Human Rights determined that the CIA tortured Abu Zubaydah.
Our position in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians does not help.

The cluelessness of lawmakers explains why the Senate Intelligence Committee released its torture report now.
It gives extremists one more reason to attack the U.S. To be clear, the report only gave more details of CIA activities.
In fact, Feinstein noted that, after Sept. 11, the CIA was encouraged "to do whatever it could to prevent another attack."
But the extremists plot every day to attack America.
We need information to prevent attacks.

RIS - France declared a state of emergency and secured its borders Friday night after attackers unleashed a coordinated wave of explosions, gunfire and hostage-taking in Paris that left more than 132 people dead and generated scenes of horror and carnage.
"We are going to lead a war which will be pitiless," Hollande said outside the Bataclan concert hall, scene of the most bloodshed.
The scale and sophistication of the attacks will be likely to prompt questions about how the planning for such an operation evaded the scrutiny of French intelligence services.
Government personnel guided survivors of the attack, wrapped in gold-colored heat blankets, down the street to waiting buses.

The reality, however, is that the costs associated with the process of recycling almost always outweigh the benefits.
Even the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says it only makes sense economically and environmentally to recycle about 35 percent of discarded materials.
New York Times science columnist John Tierney recently wrote, citing the work of author Chris Goodall, "If you wash plastic in water that was heated by coal-derived electricity, then the net effect of your recycling could be more carbon in the atmosphere."
To reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1 ton you have to recycle 3 tons of glass.
By sending an extra fleet of trucks around town once a week, adherents of the recycling religion actually are undermining their stated goal of protecting the environment.

In fact, we produce twice as much waste per capita as Western European nations.
Recycling jumped dramatically nationwide after the mid-1980s, but it leveled off around 2010, with the average American recycling or composting 34 percent of his waste.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that we recycle 99 percent of lead acid batteries, 67 percent of paper, and 55 percent of aluminum cans, but only 40 percent of the rapidly increasing quantity of consumer electronics such as cellphones and computers, only 34 percent of glass containers, and 30 percent of plastic bottles and jars.
Cities such as Seattle impose fees that are proportional to the amount of waste put out for collection, a so-called pay-as-you-throw system.
Doing that would send exactly the wrong message as cities and businesses across the nation try to build a new commitment to sustainable use of resources.
Experts in sustainable management believe that we should start by redesigning production processes where possible to prevent or minimize waste in the first place.
Then to the extent possible, we reuse what cannot be reduced, recycle what is left over, and only then dispose of what cannot be recycled.
But there are ways to deal with that cost rather than declare it excessive and abandon recycling programs.
Think about what else such fees might do to reduce excessive packaging and wasted food.

If it was cost-effective to recycle scrap paper, producers would be beating down your door to buy it.
Even if that were not true, the EPA says that recycling a ton of plastic saves only about a ton of carbon dioxide.
If recycling were truly cost-effective, private companies would be lined up at your doorstep to buy your trash.
The true recycling test is whether someone is willing to pay you to sort and save your trash.
We Americans consume a lot and waste a lot.
Then to the extent possible, we reuse what cannot be reduced, recycle what is left over, and only then dispose of what cannot be recycled.
No one argues that the cost of recycling is unimportant.
We could follow the lead of the most innovative cities by putting a price on trash.

If it was cost-effective to recycle scrap paper, producers would be beating down your door to buy it.
Some critics see matters differently.
The reality, however, is that the cost of the recycling process almost always outweighs the benefits.
Carbon dioxide is produced during the recycling process and can lead to climate change.
If you include the cost of collecting glass in small quantities from neighborhoods, and the pollution produced by the collection trucks and the recycling process itself, glass recycling creates more emissions.
In fact, we produce twice as much waste per person as Western Europe.
Then to the extent possible, we should reuse what is left over, and only then throw out anything that cannot be recycled.
If people have to pay more, they will find ways to reduce the amount of trash they throw out, as will businesses, and the fees can cover the cost of recycling programs.
Plastic provides another problem.
If it was cheap enough to recycle scrap paper, producers would be beating down your door to buy it.
Because people feel emotional about the motto "reduce, reuse, recycle."
If recycling saved money, companies would be lined up at your doorstep to buy your trash.
People started recycling much more after the mid-1980s.
They do not want to contribute to the cost of city recycling programs and say the cities should end their programs or pay for the cost themselves.
It will reduce waste and pollution and get people to change what they use and what they throw out.
They argue that recycling costs too much and is not effective.

"Protect girls from cruelty," she said in her annual Malala Day speech, saying girls should not be forced to marry or to leave school to become brides "when they should be girls," or to give birth to children "when they themselves are children."
Gunmen destroyed most of the bridge on the road between Maiduguri and Biu on Saturday night, making it impossible for vehicles to cross, the spokesman for the Nigerian Vigilante Group, Abbas Gava, told The Associated Press.
Malala met Monday with Nigeria\'s President Goodluck Jonathan and told reporters that the president "promised me that the girls will be returned as soon as possible."
When the activists tried to march peacefully to the presidential villa in May, they were blocked by soldiers and police.
On Monday, he told Malala that criticism that his government is not doing enough "is very wrong and misplaced," according to a presidential statement.
"Nigerians are saying \'Bring Back Our Girls,\' and we are telling Jonathan to bring back our arrested warriors, our army," he said in the video, which was obtained by the AP through similar channels used for previous messages.

The Nazi soldiers made their orders very clear: Jewish American prisoners of war were to be separated from their fellow brothers in arms and sent to an uncertain fate.
As the highest-ranking noncommissioned officer held in the German POW camp, he ordered more than 1,000 Americans captives to step forward with him and brazenly pronounced: "We are all Jews here."
Roddie Edmonds seemed like an ordinary American soldier, but he had an extraordinary sense of responsibility and dedication to his fellow human beings," said Avner Shalev, chairman of the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and memorial.
As it happened, Nixon purchased his exclusive Upper East Side townhouse from Lester Tanner, a prominent New York lawyer who mentioned in passing how Edmonds had saved him and dozens of other Jews during the war.
With all the camp\'s inmates defiantly standing in front of their barracks, the German commander turned to Edmonds and said: "They cannot all be Jews."
"And then my dad said: \'If you are going to shoot, you are going to have to shoot all of us because we know who you are and you\'ll be tried for war crimes when we win this war,\'" recalled Chris Edmonds, who estimates his father\'s actions saved the lives of more than 200 Jewish-American soldiers.
More than 26,000 have been designated "Righteous Among the Nations," the most famous being Oskar Schindler, whose efforts to save more than 1,000 Jews were documented in Steven Spielberg\'s 1993 film "Schindler\'s List," and Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who is credited for having saved at least 20,000 Jews before mysteriously disappearing.
But prior to Edmonds, only four were Americans, and they all belonged to the clergy or volunteered for rescue groups.

The state no longer has over-capacity issues after some existing facilities were expanded and new ones were built, said Patrick Crimmins, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services.
A decade ago, the United States would have routinely tried to deport the unaccompanied children caught at the border, arguing they were violating U.S. immigration laws.
Sponsors ideally are family, but also included are licensed programs willing to accept legal custody of a child, such as shelters for homeless youth.
ORR also is not required to do background checks or a "home study" that includes home visits for every sponsor, and advocates say many sponsors don\'t receive either.
The Border Patrol apprehended 24,481 unaccompanied children in 2012, more than three times than in 2008.
Others are trying to break free from poverty and get a better life in the United States, or to reunite with family members already in the states.
By government estimates, it could climb to nearly 24,000 within the next year.
At one point last year, the federal government used military bases in Texas to temporarily house the overflow of undocumented and unaccompanied children in its care.

The Harvard debate team also was crowned world champions in 2014.
Against Harvard, the inmates were tasked with defending a position they opposed: They had to argue that public schools should be allowed to turn away students whose parents entered the United States illegally.
"The fact that we won is nice, but it isn\'t the most important thing," said Kenner, adding that the club is meant to help students articulate what they\'ve learned.
Inmates can earn various degrees through the initiative, which is taught primarily by Bard faculty.

Against Harvard, the inmates were tasked with defending a position they opposed: They had to argue that public schools should be allowed to turn away students whose parents entered the United States illegally.
About 15 percent of the all-male inmates at the Eastern New York Correctional Facility in Napanoch are enrolled.
Graduates of the program have continued their studies at Yale and Columbia universities, Kenner said.
"They make the most of every opportunity they have," Kenner said.

Over the years, they have sponsored legislation to ban smoking on airplanes, led efforts to remove depictions of tobacco use in films and successfully sued the tobacco industry for misleading the public about the dangers of smoking.
It was energy drinks \u2014 sweetened beverages with large doses of stimulants for quick energy boosts that have become increasingly popular over the last decade, particularly with high school and college students who often use them to study late into the night.
They have called upon the Food and Drug Administration to investigate the safety of energy drinks and urged high school and college sports organizations to educate their athletes on the risks of combining the beverages with physical activity.
About 1,500 of those visits were by children ages 12 to 17.

But Durbin, Markey and Blumenthal are drawing upon their previous fights against the sale and advertising of cigarettes to children under age 18.
He recalled the efforts of the tobacco industry to attract young smokers to replace older customers who were dying off.
They argued that their advertising is aimed at sporting events with broad appeal, such as the X Games and NASCAR, and is not trying to target adolescents.

That\'s what I thought libraries were for," said Yakob, 18, of Minneapolis.
Librarians, once masters of the card catalog, have learned to mine information online, offering help with everything from basic computer skills to Facebook and LinkedIn.
Eighty percent of library-goers surveyed said the ability to borrow books was "very important."
They usually end up with a little bit more," Anoka County library services assistant Andrea Egbert said of the litany of tech-related quandaries that library patrons bring to her.
Some walk in with new e-readers, still in the box, unsure how to switch on the devices.
In some cases, technological advances mean less face-to-face interaction at the library.
The Ramsey County, Minn., library system bought a MakerBot 3-D printer two years ago, primarily for use with teen programming.

Flo is a highly trained war dog who knows how to find buried explosives and can detect the smells of more than 50 types of chemicals.
Now she does not receive any assistance from the military.
Witt credits the two dogs he worked with in the Vietnam War for saving his life.
None of them returned home at the end of the war \u2014 half were given to the South Vietnamese army, while the others were put to sleep.
In 1992, President Bill Clinton signed legislation that ensures all military dogs are treated like true veterans.
Still, they are not eligible for health care once they are retired.
When he arrived at the training camp to meet Flo, one of the trainers came up to him and said, "Oh, you have a really special dog."
While Flo and Crangle were stationed in Helmand province, they always walked at the front of foot patrols.
Crangle adopted Flo and drove to Chicago to pick her up at the airport.
Of all the effects of war on Afghanistan, among the most surreal \u2014 and perhaps the happiest \u2014 is swan boats.
On a recent day, nearly 40 of the bird-shaped pedal boats packed with families were meandering around the almost painfully blue mineral waters of the main lake here.
The park is a particularly special refuge for women and children, who lack places almost everywhere else in the country to simply get outside and enjoy life without worrying about bombs, firefights or oppressive conservative males.
Like much of what people do in Afghanistan, a visit to Band-e Amir often is underpinned by religion.
Ali is said to have created the lakes through various amazing feats, including a slash of his sword, and damming the resulting valley with, among other things, cheese.
Already, the Afghan government is supporting nearly all the operations related to the park, and the Ministry of Agriculture just approved eight new jobs for people to clean the park.
The swan boats, which the Afghans insisted be added to the Wildlife Conservation Society plans, generate income for families in 15 area villages.
There are several other guesthouses close by, and in high season, locals rent out rooms in their homes.
A ranger station, a training center and a reception center are under construction, and there are plans for shuttle buses and more parking.
There are tentative plans for a massive international airport close to the park, but the potential for international tourism, at least while the war continues, is murky.
From several came one of the rarest public sounds in Afghanistan: women laughing uproariously.
For centuries Afghans have believed that the waters of the group of six lakes known as Band-e Amir can cure illness and infertility.
Two watermelons were bobbing in the frigid waters of the lake a few feet away, cooling down.

"U.S. consumers can be adding to this without knowing it," said Linda Walker of the WWF.
"There is no expert in the world who can tell from the appearance of the wood that this is a different species," said Nikolay Shmatkov, who works for the WWF in Moscow.
From 2004 to 2011, oak timber exports from Russia to China were two to four times the amount allowed.
The changes mean that U.S. companies now also have to follow the laws in the exporting countries.
They are also responsible for wrongdoing by suppliers or middlemen.

In the newfound arena of social media as activism, few hashtags have generated as much buzz as "#iftheygunnedmedown," which has been circulating around Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
Still, the trending hashtag was several hours old before Alexis Nwaiwu, a 19-year-old sophomore at Georgia State University, decided to post.
His death has not only sparked unrest in Ferguson, to the point where President Barack Obama issued a statement, but social media have also exploded, picking up his cause.
"The assumption is that black males are predators and because of that perceived threat as a predator, you can do anything to them," said David Wall Rice, chairman of the psychology department at Morehouse College.
Since the hashtag campaign started, "#iftheygunnedmedown" has been used on Twitter more than 158,000 times, according to The New York Times.
Eric Deggans, television critic for National Public Radio and the author of "Race-Baiter: How the Media Wields Dangerous Words to Divide a Nation," said the use of social media, particularly among African-Americans, has given voice to people who might otherwise have been silenced.
"The media reducing black men to one staid image they are comfortable with, while ignoring the complexity of the wholeness of who black men are \u2014 it should not be a question of which one, but rather showing the whole person."
Tarshia Stanley, chairwoman of the Spelman College English Department, said that while she agrees that the hashtag campaign has been positive, she cautions about it ultimately being relegated to a slogan that "re-inscribes images that were troublesome to start with."
"We have to, as a community, think about these issues of safety and violence toward young black men, particularly coming from authority," Stanley said.

The Sherpas have no one leader, and those at basecamp said their walkout was for a variety of reasons, including to honor their dead friends.
"There are a lot of Sherpas leaving this morning, and in the next two days there will be a huge number that will follow," said Marzec, 67, who is from California.
The disaster has reignited a debate over the disproportionate risks the Sherpas take on Everest, where most climbers are well-heeled amateurs with little or no experience at high altitudes.
At times, they are also "short-roped" directly to weak climbers to help them get up the mountain.
"It was crowd behavior \u2014 some hooligans were creating problems, but things are getting back to normal," said Sushil Ghimire, secretary of Nepal\'s Tourism Ministry.
"There are a lot of Sherpas leaving this morning, and in the next two days there will be a huge number that will follow," said Marzec, 67, who is from California.
He said he had already decided to abandon his climb.
Tusli Gurung, a guide who was at base camp Wednesday, estimated that nearly half the Sherpas had left.
Family members of the dead Sherpas said they are angry at the government and worried about their future.
We have no idea how we are going to support the family," said 17-year-old Phinjum, Kaji\'s second daughter.
Sherpas packed up their tents and left the Mount Everest base camp Wednesday, throwing the entire climbing season into doubt.
Sherpas at base camp said their walkout was for a variety of reasons, including to honor their dead friends.
If the expeditions cancel, many climbers will have to forfeit most or all of the money they have spent to go up the mountain \u2014 $75,000 or more.
"There are a lot of Sherpas leaving this morning, and in the next two days there will be a huge number that will follow," said Marzec, who has decided to abandon his climb.

Dozens of Sherpa guides packed up their tents and left the Mount Everest base camp Wednesday.
Climbers rely on the Nepalese mountaineers to guide them to the top of Everest and carry their equipment.
American climber Ed Marzec said that Sherpas were loading their equipment onto a helicopter.
That comes to about $175,000 each year.
Nearly 30 climbers have died on the Khumbu Icefall since 1963.

A rapidly mutating virus has leaped from plants to honeybees, where it is reproducing and contributing to the collapse of colonies vital to the multibillion-dollar agricultural industry, according to a new study.
The discovery is the first report of honeybees becoming infected by a pollen-borne RNA virus that spread systematically through the bees and hives.
Traces of the virus were detected in every part of the bee examined, except its eyes, according to the study.
Commercially cultivated bees pollinate about 90 crops worldwide, a service valued at $14 billion annually.
That adds a complex layer to the forces driving colony collapse disorder, scientists warned.
"They have a high mutation rate," said Yan Ping Chen, a bee pathologist at the USDA Agricultural Research Service laboratory in Maryland and lead author of the study.
But we do have evidence that TRSV along with other viruses that we screen on a regular basis are associated with lower rates of over-winter survival."
Indeed, the new virus, along with the well documented Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus, was correlated with colonies deemed "weak" due to a variety of stresses.
Activists have raised concern about a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids, which have been banned in Europe.
Another study found 35 pesticides and fungicides, some at lethal levels, in the pollen collected from bees servicing major food crops in five states, including California.

Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) is a pathogen \u2014 that is, disease-causing microorganism.
Pollination is the process by which pollen is transported from the male to the female parts of plants, allowing for plant fertilization and reproduction.
Just how big a role the new virus has been playing in the death of colonies is unknown.
It is also unclear whether the infected bees can spread the virus to otherwise healthy plants.
Another study found 35 pesticides and fungicides, some at fatal levels, in the pollen collected from bees servicing major food crops.
A separate study last year looked at bees fed with high-fructose corn syrup, which many commercial beekeepers now feed to bees instead of their own honey.

A study published this Tuesday has identified a previously unknown factor contributing to the collapse of honeybee colonies: A virus has spread from plants to the bees.
It is carried by pollen and is known to damage soy crops.
Pollination is the process by which pollen is transported from the male to the female parts of plants.
It would be difficult, Chen said, to separate it from other factors threatening the health of bee colonies.
But he said there is evidence that TRSV and other viruses are linked with lower rates of survival of the bees through the winter.
And infection rates rose to a 22.5 percent high in winter, according to the study.
A study last year linked them with lowered resistance to disease and the spread of viruses in bees.
Another study found 35 pesticides and fungicides in the pollen collected from bees servicing major food crops.
Last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency issued a joint report that listed the major identified causes of colony collapse: pesticides, pathogens, and inadequate nutrition.

Many nutrition and health experts disagree, citing studies that show repeated exposure to fruits and vegetables eventually leads children to eat more of them.
That, in turn, will help prevent [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) and related maladies, says William J. McCarthy, a UCLA professor of health policy and management.
She co-wrote a study, published this month, that found that students observed over two days in four Boston schools ate more fruits and vegetables after the new rules took effect \u2014 although they still threw away much of them.
The Utah study found that rewards such as raffle tickets and small amounts of money got students to eat more produce with far less waste than mandatory servings.

And the meat is "nasty."
That comes to $18 million a year \u2014 based on a conservative estimate that 10 percent of the food is wasted.
The money, Binkle says, would be far better spent on higher quality items, such as strawberries or watermelons.
For Binkle and many other school food managers, the hardest change has been the requirement to offer both a fruit and vegetable.
The extra produce costs school districts $5.4 million a day.
A study discovered that a total of 40 percent of all the lunches served in four Boston schools are thrown out.
A federal survey found that 48 of 50 states reported that food waste and higher costs have been their top challenges.

Later this year, the Supreme Court of the United States will decide whether states should be allowed to ban gay marriage, as several now do.
Granade, a federal judge in the Southern District of Alabama, called the state ban unconstitutional.
Then, there were those judges who tried to stand in the middle as best they could, or who perhaps just hoped to stall for time.
"Right now we\'re not going to do it," Probate Judge Jerry Powell said.
Susan Watson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, said probate judges risk lawsuits for refusing to issue the licenses.
Without the delay on Judge Granade\'s order, "there will likely be more confusion in the coming months" before the federal court makes its final decision about the legality of same-sex marriage.
At the southern end of the state, in coastal Fairhope, the Reverend Jerry Henry expressed disapproval and pondered what the changes might mean for the church.

(A car trying to "initiate movement" from the back would end up rear-ending the car in front of it.)
These rules allow the penguins to stay organized, to maximize heat conservation and even merge two smaller penguin huddles together.
So although these emperor penguins don\'t dance like the fleet-footed characters in the 2006 animated film "Happy Feet," they still perform some pretty fancy footwork.

Research suggests that diet soft drinks and other artificially sweetened products may actually contribute to weight gain.
Last year, Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi ranked third and seventh, respectively, in U.S. carbonated soft-drink sales.
Safety controversies have clouded the use of a number of artificial sweeteners for decades, especially NutraSweet and saccharin.
For example, a two-year study of 164 children, published in 2005, found that overweight kids drank more diet sodas than normal-weight children.
A 2010 review of previous research studies concluded that "artificial sweeteners may contribute to weight gain."
However, it points to evidence that "industry-funded studies in biomedical research are less trustworthy than those funded independently."
The petition to the FDA could bring the agency back into one of the bigger controversies in its decades of food safety regulation: its decisions in the early 1980s to approve the use of aspartame, first as a food additive and then in diet soft drinks.
There have been several research studies and books that link aspartame to health problems ranging from cancers to neurological ailments.

Alice Finch\'s sculpture of Hogwarts Castle, inspired by the "Harry Potter" books by J.K. Rowling, is vast.
It is elaborately detailed, with multicolored bottles in the Potions classroom, mossy leaves bursting out of pots in the greenhouse, tiny framed art along the grand staircase, and even a transparent ghost haunting the Ravenclaw Towers.
A former middle-school teacher who lives with her family on Mercer Island, in Washington state, Finch is an AFOL, or Adult Fan of Lego.
The result, so colorful and lush it seems to have organically sprung up from the earth, was also a prizewinner.
Her studio holds, she thinks, about 2 million bricks, all meticulously sorted by color and size.
She is currently a member of SeaLUG (Seattle Lego Users Group), which has about 150 members, many of whom specialize in such areas as castles, space travel or robotics.
Finch, who teaches Lego camps for children, hopes that her visibility as a Lego master will inspire more girls to get creative with the bricks.
When she debuted the Hogwarts build, she said, "people were confused and surprised that a woman had done this."
Going public with her work, in the film and in public events like BrickCon, was not her original intention.
"It\'s a creative process that I enjoy doing \u2026 not something I do for recognition," she says, but she knows that her visibility might be inspiring.
But her favorite Lego buddies are her two sons, Thorin, 11, and Hadrian, 7.
She and Thorin recently collaborated on a colorful "How to Train Your Dragon"-inspired build, and Hadrian, as a 5-year-old, left his mark on Rivendell.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the nation\'s first black to hold that post, urged NAACP members convening in Orlando on Tuesday to help overturn stand-your-ground laws that "senselessly expand the concept of self-defense."
Holder also said his office is examining all available evidence before deciding whether to pursue charges against neighborhood watchman Zimmerman in the shooting death of the black teen \u2014 though he gave no indication of the timetable involved.
He told NAACP members attending the group\'s 104th annual convention to peacefully confront "the unfortunate stereotypes" that sometimes lead to police suspicion and private misjudgment.
Holder praised the relatively peaceful reaction to Saturday\'s acquittal of Zimmerman and the "dignity" of Martin\'s parents.
Barriers based on race persist, despite other progress, Holder said: "These problems are real.

Meanwhile, the problem-solving power of a supercomputer in Reston, Va., nicknamed "Tide" and a backup in Orlando named "Gyre" has been more than doubled, from 90 trillion to 213 trillion calculations per second.
The combination of HWRF and Tide alone should significantly sharpen intensity projections, Franklin said.
Better projections are crucial because forecasters still are unable to anticipate when a system might rapidly bulk up.
The hurricane center has steadily honed its track forecasts to the point that five-day projections are as accurate as three-day forecasts were in 2000.
In addition to tropical forecasts, the upgraded HWRF and supercomputer should bolster other types of predictions, from excessive heat warnings in South Florida to blizzard threats in North Dakota, NOAA officials said.
The forecasting improvements were spurred by Superstorm Sandy, which devastated the U.S. coast last October.
In the aftermath, Congress allotted $24.3 million as part of a disaster relief bill.
"This is historic in terms of capacity increase," said Louis Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service.
Armed with a supercomputer capable of conducting 213 trillion calculations per second and an amped-up weather model, the National Hurricane Center hopes to improve tropical predictions up to 15 percent this season.
"If you don\'t have the structure of the storm right, it\'s hard to tell how it will interact with its environment," said James Franklin, the hurricane center\'s top hurricane specialist.
The combination of HWRF and Tide alone should significantly sharpen intensity projections, Franklin said.
In turn, the HWRF should be able to analyze how much thunderstorm activity is around the core and whether a system might weaken or burst with strength, Franklin said.
Even so, the combination of HWRF and the supercomputer should improve path projections between 5 and 15 percent this year, Franklin said.

More money is to be spent for another major upgrade by 2015.
While you could do that with any recording, this one is even closer and more precise."
George Litterst, a Massachusetts pianist and Yamaha consultant, said the network is expected to grow this year to 50 universities and 40 to 50 audition sites.
At age 13, he sent a recording from a similar Disklavier in Moscow to audition for an international music competition based in Minnesota.
The Disklavier is a conventional piano that has been wired with extremely precise sensors to measure the movement of its mechanical parts.
And, aside from the classroom teaching benefits, universities wonder if remote auditions will bring them a more diverse group of students.
"If somebody in China wanted to audition for St. Olaf, we could arrange for them to do the audition electronically, which would be much more cost-effective for the student," McWilliams said.
Initially, it will be used to receive audition recordings for the 2015 International e-Piano Junior Competition to be held at UM, and for teaching.
He won third place, and the experience brought him there to study.
Nikiforov has already benefited from Internet auditions.
The sound produced is practically the same to that of the original piano.
"We\'ve got these nice little high school formulas that work in a lot of basic cases," Weymouth says.
"But we\'re trying to simplify it down to the smallest physical system we can really reasonably measure\u2014that\'s one atom against another."
The researchers studied the case of a tiny tungsten tip coated with a thin layer of silicon sliding against a surface of pure silicon crystal coated with hydrogen.
The researchers found that friction depended strongly on whether the tip was dragged along the direction in which the pairs were oriented, or whether it was swept in the perpendicular direction.
"Experimentally this has not been done before," Weymouth says.
Beyond adding to the overall picture of how friction works on a fundamental level, the research could help improve the efficiency of all sorts of machines that lose energy to friction.
"A better understanding of friction will benefit applications ranging from the study of geological faults to the prediction of wear in automobile components or microelectromechanical systems."
While this basic description generally holds true, even for Michael Jackson, many subtleties of friction remain mysterious.
"But we\'re very bad at taking two arbitrary surfaces and saying what the friction will be."
"A better understanding of friction will benefit applications ranging from the study of geological faults to the prediction of wear in automobile components or microelectromechanical systems."
Friction is both the boon and the bane of our everyday lives.

Smith and Bastille, a British pop band also on the Capitol label, were nominated for Grammys as best new artist.
Smith received six nominations for his debut album, including the rare feat for a freshman artist, being nominated in the top four awards: best record, album, song and new artist.
It did not invest in developing new artists and did not deal well with the changes.
The first step was to hire the right leader, said Grainge.
In his three years running Columbia Records, the label introduced artists including the British soul singer Adele, the boy band One Direction and Los Angeles indie-rock group Foster the People, among others.
He offered empty offices to other Universal Music labels, including Motown.
Barnett said he felt safe betting the house on Sam Smith.
That hunch paid off.
He told The Times that he auditioned for many labels, but he only saw a passion for the songs when he sang for Nick Raphael, the head of Capitol in England.
"There was such a warmth, a passion and a respect for what I did," he said.
Grainge and Barnett would not say how much the new owners have spent reviving Capitol.
Grainge said the changes he and Barnett made at Capitol are not part of some big business shakeup.
In 2014, Capitol had two of the biggest new artists of the year: British singer-songwriter Sam Smith and the Australian boy band 5 Seconds of Summer.
Smith received six nominations for his debut album, including the rare feat for a freshman artist, being nominated in the top four awards: best record, album, song and new artist.
Capitol had been hurt by changes in the music business during the last decade.
Music lovers went from buying CDs to downloading songs and albums, then to streaming music online.
He hired Barnett, who had been a manager for AC/DC, Cyndi Lauper and other musicians.
That hunch paid off.
Katy Perry\'s "Prism" album also did very well for Capitol.
When Steve Barnett became the boss at Capitol Records, the first thing he did was clean out the offices.
Capitol Records was founded in 1942 in Los Angeles and has recorded albums for famous music stars including the Beatles, Beach Boys and Frank Sinatra.
Before Barnett became chairman of Capitol Records Group, he was president of Columbia Records.
The first step was to hire the right leader, Grainge said.
When he was running Columbia Records, the label introduced artists including British soul singer Adele, the boy band One Direction and the indie-rock group Foster the People.
Barnett also decided to restore the Capitol Tower in Los Angeles, a historic building where the label got started.
Universal Music wanted to nurture Capitol back to success by helping its people and bringing in new artists and workers.

In Moore, Oklahoma, on May 20, it was 16 minutes.
At the University of Oklahoma, meteorological researchers are building sensors and advising OSU researchers on data collection.
"We have the (unmanned aircraft) expertise, we have the weather expertise and, by golly, we have the weather," said Stephen McKeever, Oklahoma\'s state secretary of science and technology and a vice president for research at OSU.
"In many senses we\'re the perfect laboratory to do this kind of thing."
Remotely controlled by a pilot, the small aircraft weigh up to 55 pounds and can range in cost from $10,000 to $100,000, depending on the types of technology involved.
Sensors would collect data on temperature, humidity and pressure while intercepting a storm, crucial information in tornado prediction.
"If you live in Oklahoma, you have an interest in tornadoes," Jacob said.
One team had scheduled a test flight for an aircraft built for a Department of Homeland Security public safety drone program May 20, the day the tornado hit Moore.
Apart from weather research, the aircraft can be used to help fight wildfires, dust agricultural crops and inspect pipes.
Quiet ones can also be used to locate survivors in the aftermath of a disaster.
"We\'re really excited actually about how our technology can be re-deployed from border patrol into flying into storms to gather and collect data that can really save a lot of people\'s lives," said Jacob Stockton, a master\'s student pursuing OSU\'s degree in unmanned aerial systems.
The committee met May 31, hours before the El Reno storm hit the Oklahoma City metropolitan area.
Under current Federal Aviation Administration regulations, it is illegal to operate unmanned aircraft in the national airspace.
For the first step, the FAA is preparing to set up six test sites around the nation for the research and development of unmanned aircraft.
With tornadoes, advance warning comes down to minutes.
Researchers also aim to improve forecasting by monitoring the atmosphere before and after storms form.
Since then, his focus has shifted to twisters and the questions still confounding scientists: how, why and when tornadoes form.
They delayed the flight two days and successfully launched the plane into clear skies.

"This is a great, big, hard problem," said Richard DeVaul, a Google engineer and chief technical architect for the company\'s Project Loon, so named in part because even Google concedes the idea sounds a little crazy.
But after a trial run in New Zealand earlier this year, DeVaul and other engineers on the project say they believe a global network of low-cost, high-altitude balloons could carry enough wireless transponders to beam Internet connections to remote parts of Africa, Asia and other developing regions.
Google has been working on Loon for nearly two years, but it only recently went public.
The concept calls for a fleet of hundreds or even thousands of balloons that will float twice as high as most jetliners fly, in a circle around Earth.
But while it sounds relatively simple, the logistics are mind-boggling.
Rogers planned to recover it, but in case someone else found it first, the plastic foam box holding its electronic gear carried a label that read, "Harmless Science Experiment," and another that provided a phone number to call.
Only half-filled with helium, and already more than 12 feet wide, the giant plastic envelope shimmered and shook in the breeze like some airborne jellyfish rising through a gentle current.

So Google engineers devised a system to raise or lower them in order to catch the air currents needed to keep them floating just the right distance from each other.
They also need to stay aligned so if one floats out of range from Internet users in a particular region, another will come along and take its place.

He approached a paleontology team nearby and asked the experts to inspect his find.
The creature, labeled "the horniest dinosaur," with a record-breaking 15 horns jutting from its skull, was eventually named Kosmoceratops richardsoni.

The courses were taught by Penn professors and offered in partnership with an online education company.
Last week, the nation focused its attention on the 10-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, the most destructive hurricane in U.S. history.
The gray swan storms were generated by a computer model that "coupled" together, in the researchers\' parlance, a very high-resolution hurricane model with a global climate model.
"When you do hundreds and hundreds of thousands of events, you\'re going to see hurricanes that are unlike anything you\'ve seen in history," said Emanuel, a key theoretician behind the equations determining the "maximum potential intensity" of a hurricane in a given climate.
Check out any good map that shows the water depth (the bathymetry) around the Florida peninsula.
Also, surges can amplify by being funneled into bays," Emanuel said in an email.
They simulated 2,100 possible Tampa Bay hurricanes in the current climate, and then 3,100 each for three time periods (2006 through 2036, 2037 through 2067, and 2068 through 2098) in an unchecked global-warming scenario.
Granted, the study said that these two "gray swans" are exceedingly unlikely \u2014 less than 1 in 10,000 years for the 5.9-meter surge in the current climate.
But you could make the case that a study like this helps us think a lot better about what risk is all about.
"It\'s not likely, but it\'s not impossible."
Granted, these theoretical storms are also highly unlikely to occur.
Earlier, in 1848, another storm produced a surge of 4.6 meters, or about 15 feet.
The city of Tampa may be well removed from the barrier islands that get battered by the waves from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is in a more exposed spot than you would think.
The researchers simulated 2,100 possible Tampa Bay hurricanes in the current climate.
Moreover, in a late 21st century climate with bad global warming, the worst-case scenario included a very different storm track.
That storm would cause a surge of nearly 11.1 meters, or nearly 37 feet.
However, it also said that global warming makes the worst possible surges more likely.
The study also shows that for Cairns, Australia, an 5.7-meter, or 18-foot, storm surge is possible in the current climate, but that would happen less than once in 10,000 years.

Libby pointed out that preschool teaches children self-discipline, motivation and the ability to be a team player.
Gym class is often one of the first subjects cut when school districts lack funds.
He described how even recruits who make it into the Army often struggle during basic training.
He blames years of junk food, television and video games and the lack of regular physical activity.
When the U.S. military decided in January to permit women to serve in combat units, it was not just doing it to be fair -- it was doing it to help solve a recruitment problem.
The general made his comments to a reporter from National Public Radio (NPR).
Still, allowing women to serve in combat units by itself cannot solve the recruitment problem.
The U.S. military recently decided to let women serve in combat.
Recruits must have a clean criminal record.
Combat roles can involve operating tanks, using heavy weapons and ground fighting.
Today only one in four young Americans has what it takes to qualify for the military.
On Tuesday, Senate investigators delivered a controversial report about CIA interrogations.
Treatment in secret prisons after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was worse than the government told Congress or the public, said the report from the Senate Intelligence Committee.
President Barack Obama declared the past practices to be "contrary to our values" and pledged, "I will continue to use my authority as president to make sure we never resort to those methods again."
American embassies and military sites worldwide were taking extra precautions.
CIA officials maintain they gained important information that still guides counterterrorism efforts.

In 1493, Christopher Columbus returned to Europe with much astounding news.
It is in the sodas Americans drink and the potato chips they snack on.
It is in virtually all chicken and turkey, and even most fish.
Until the 1800s, corn was eaten mostly by the poor.
The first is sweet corn, which Americans grill on the cob in the summer, and boil or bake during the rest of the year.
Sweet corn is the most beloved variety, and is what most people think of when they hear the word "corn."
A second type, flint corn, has a soft center and harder outer shell.
Then there is dent corn, which is the most important kind.
It is in most animals we eat, because it is fed to them.
In 1493, Christopher Columbus returned to Europe with much astounding news.
In 1493, Christopher Columbus returned to Europe with amazing news.
One of the most exciting things Columbus found out about was a grain called corn.
Corn never really did get that popular in Europe.
Corn is in the sodas Americans drink and the potato chips they munch on.
Soon, it was on dining tables all over the country.
However, very little of the corn we grow is sweet corn.
It is everywhere even if we often do not notice it.
Corn has come a long way since Columbus first tasted it.
There is only one certainty in what has fast become a Dantesque drama to save world-renowned olive groves in Puglia from the deadly Xylella fastidiosa bacterium: olive trees, the very symbol of this southern Italian region, are dying en masse.
Less certain still is just how the deadly bacterium was introduced to the area.
"There is no such thing as Xylella," says Pasquale Spina, a farmer whose trees are in the buffer zone.
"We can\'t get distracted," he says.

There is only one certainty in the emerging botanical crisis in southern Italy: centuries-old olive trees are dying due to the deadly Xylella fastidiosa bacterium.
No one even knows how many trees have already died.
No one can say exactly how this bacterium affects the trees.
The European Union (EU) is understandably worried.
They have declared that everything south of the Pugliese town of Lecce is a dead zone.
Virologists are scientists who study viruses that affect humans, animals, insects, bacteria and plants.
This is becoming increasing difficult.
Few experts know as much about X. fastidiosa bacterium as Alexander Purcell, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
The bad news, however, is that these ancient trees are dying fast, and with them, an ancient culture.

That debate fits into a larger pattern: A huge upsurge of mayhem in the 1970s and 1980s led to tough-on-crime measures across the country.
Now, after two decades of improvements in most places, policies such as long, mandatory prison sentences and expansions of police surveillance are being questioned.

Most U.S. colleges and universities have exchange programs, which offer their students the chance to study at another school elsewhere in the world for a year or semester.
The U.S. government wants more Americans studying in Latin America, which was one reason for coinciding visits Wednesday by both Secretary of State John Kerry and Janet Napolitano, the former Department of Homeland Security secretary.
Napolitano now heads the 10-campus University of California (UC) system.
Among them, that Mexico is dangerous and that the United States is unfriendly to Mexicans.
But the numbers have dropped with the spike in drug violence, especially during the stepped-up attacks on drug networks by the administration of former President Felipe Calderon, who left office in 2012.
That dropped more than 50 percent to 3,815 by the 2011-2012 school year \u2014 the most recent figures available.
Young Americans wanting to study in Latin America have stopped focusing on Mexico, which is no longer the No.
Justin Bogda, 21, did an internship at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City in the summer of 2013 while studying at the University of Southern California.
"They said, \'Oh my God, there\'s all the violence,\' because of what they see on the news,\'" said the New Jersey native.
According to the Institute of International Education, 8,360 Americans studied in Mexico in the 2000-2001 academic year.
Napolitano said she wants more exchanges between University of California campuses and Mexican universities.
She added that it should also include professors and researchers, not just students.
Kerry said he wants to start a discussion of new ideas and research in higher education between the two countries.
Even if violence drops off, "it can be hard for the numbers to rebound," she said.
"They said, \'Oh my God, there\'s all the violence,\' because of what they see on the news,\'" said Bogda, who is from New Jersey.

As early as next spring, the boom of seismic cannons will sound under the Atlantic Ocean as the first oil and gas exploration allowed off the East Coast in three decades gets underway.
"I just can\'t understand how anybody would propose something that\'s going to be just a rape of the East Coast, endangering whales and dolphins and turtles and fish," he said.
"It\'s been pretty well documented that seismic surveys have disrupted animal behavior and animal communication," said Danielle Cholewiak, a senior acoustics researcher for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Species of large Atlantic whales, including endangered right whales, operate at low frequencies and will hear the booms.
"If there\'s a survey in Virginia you\'re going to hear it in southern North Carolina \u2014 easily," Nowacek said.
"I just can\'t understand how anybody would propose something that\'s going to be just a rape of the East Coast, endangering whales and dolphins and turtles and fish," he said.

As early as next spring, the boom of seismic cannons will sound under the Atlantic Ocean as the first oil and gas exploration allowed off the East Coast in three decades gets underway.
It will begin as early as next spring.
Federal officials and the oil and gas industry say the exploration is harmless.
"I just can\'t understand how anybody would propose something that\'s going to be ... endangering whales and dolphins and turtles and fish," Edwards said.
The seismic surveys are done with compressed air guns.
The blasts are repeated every 10 seconds or so for weeks at a time.
The 3-D maps help company geologists figure out if there is likely to be any oil and gas in the rock formations.
However, even federal scientists are worried about what the pulses of sound can do to the hearing and communication of whales and other marine life.
Many marine mammals use sound to locate food and mates, and to keep track of their young.
"It\'s been pretty well documented that seismic surveys have disrupted animal behavior and animal communication," said Danielle Cholewiak, a government researcher who studies sound.
Political leaders in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia lobbied President Barack Obama to approve the seismic testing.
They hope that Obama will allow offshore drilling to bring jobs and money to the states.
Science and years of experience prove that there is no danger to marine mammal populations, it added.
Nowacek said there has been far too little information collected on the effects of the seismic cannons.
The boom of seismic cannons will soon sound under the Atlantic Ocean as companies look for oil and gas.
It will begin as early as next spring.
In the Gulf, whales and dolphins tend to operate at frequencies far higher than the sound waves from seismic cannons.
It will start as early as next spring.

Following a social media firestorm over the lack of Rey in a new "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" Monopoly game, Disney says it is unveiling a raft of new merchandise that puts more of Rey front and center \u2014 including toys featuring her gripping a blue lightsaber.
But Disney had also planned for more than a year to hold back certain toys to avoid giving away the key plot point where she picks up the lightsaber wielded by Finn in order to duel new baddie Kylo Ren.
"The fact that she was the ultimate heroine of the film was one of the significant plot points we did want to protect," Southern said in an interview.
After all, throughout "Star Wars" merchandise history, evil lord Darth Vader has outsold any other character by at least 3 to 1.
"I want to get both versions," he said.
In addition, Disney had planned for more than a year to hold back certain toys.
He says Disney, Lucasfilm and the retailers are still adapting to the fact that "Star Wars" is not primarily a boy\'s brand like before.
In Roman times, many people believed Jupiter was the king of the gods who killed a race of giants to rule heaven and Earth.
Jupiter, as the largest planet, helped form the solar system many millions of years ago.
The force of its gravity pushed out the pieces left over when the sun and other planets formed.
Some pieces may have landed on Earth, providing the water the planet needed to develop life.
Astronomers call them "super-earths," but those planets do not have an atmosphere like ours that can support human life.
He is a scientist from the California Institute of Technology who also worked on the study.
Small, rocky planets would form close to the sun and large, cold planets with atmospheres made of gases, called gas giants, would form away from the sun.
Scientists believed all planets stayed in the same orbit around the sun after they formed.
Twenty years ago, scientists found the first planets around other stars and noticed some planets did not go around in even circles around their sun, like our solar system.
One theory says Jupiter moved from its place in the solar system to where Mars is today.
This explains the evidence that those planets formed later and why they have different atmospheres.
Next time you look up at the sky, uncrushed and uncooked, send a knowing nod to Jupiter and Saturn.

Federal supervision will ensure that tough new officer conduct standards are properly enforced.
Two other high-profile deaths involving police officers still hang over the city: that of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy who was carrying a pellet gun at a playground when he was fatally shot by a white rookie patrolman on Nov. 22, 2014, and that of 37-year-old Tanisha Anderson, a mentally ill woman who died from lack of oxygen while officers held her down on the ground on Nov. 12, 2014.
Some supervisors even told investigators that they tried to make officers look as good as possible when writing their reports.
Henderson received numerous injuries after a chase in Cleveland, and blurry footage from a helicopter appeared to show officers kicking him as he lay on the ground.
Despite an FBI investigation and a grand jury probe, no charges were brought against the four officers involved.
Meanwhile, Henderson was sentenced to three years in prison for assaulting a police officer.
In 2004, the Justice Department left it up to local police to clean up their own act, but now federal authorities are taking things a step further.
When the Cleveland report went public, community members sent city leaders their petitions and recommendations for police reforms.
Others suggested creating an online system to make police data and procedures available to the public.
The U.S. Department of Justice announced Tuesday that Cleveland has agreed to make dramatic changes within its police department.
Patrol officers also hit people over the head with guns.
Some police chiefs encouraged their officers to be rough on suspects.
Nieves Garcia came from Mexico at age 6 and spent most of her elementary school years in California classified as an "English learner" even after she had picked up the language.
Earlier this year, Tesha Sengupta-Irving, an education professor in Orange County, registered her son for kindergarten.
At the time, her parents were visiting and she was speaking to them in their native tongue, Bengali, so she wrote on her survey that the language was spoken at home.
Her son, who knew but a few words in Bengali, was tested and classified as an English learner.
She said the results were ironic since she had tirelessly tried to pass the language on to him and still he spoke only English.

Wondering who to thank for the bizarre rules that allow Congress to approve spending, then later slam the door on new borrowing to pay the bills?
In that simple civics lesson is the root of the problem.
"In the past, Congress has responded to make sure that the Treasury can still keep borrowing, but debt and budgets have always been contentious," said D. Andrew Austin, an analyst in government finance for the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service and the author of a brief but thorough history of the debt limit.
"While the debt limit has never caused the federal government to default on its obligations, it has at times caused great inconvenience and has added uncertainty to Treasury operations," Austin wrote.
In 1919, the debt ceiling was about $43 billion, but at the close of the fiscal year debt actually stood at about $25.5 billion, with Congress reluctant to borrow all that was authorized.
By 1945, the debt ceiling was set at $300 billion.
Lawmakers had grown tired of passing spending increases and then voting against raising the debt ceiling for their profligate spending.
In one example, Sen. Barack Obama took to the Senate floor on March 16, 2006, in opposition to raising the debt ceiling while George W. Bush was president.
By this July, that number had doubled to nearly $1.28 trillion.
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/US_NEWS_BALDEAGLE_FL.jpg" />SEATTLE \u2014 In a decision that highlights the clash between two cherished environmental goals \u2014 producing green energy and preserving protected wildlife \u2014 federal officials announced Friday that some wind power companies will be allowed to kill or injure bald and golden eagles for up to 30 years without penalty.
But Peter Kelley, vice president of public affairs for the American Wind Energy Association, said that for a wind farm to be permitted under the new rules, "you have to document all of the different ways you\'ll preserve the eagles.
The early permits lasted a maximum of five years, which the industry argued was not sufficient for long-term investment in wind power facilities.
Kelley said the new regulations would "increase the protection of eagles and will help develop more wind farms, a leading solution to [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming), which is the No.
"Renewable energy development is vitally important to our nation\'s future, but it has to be done the right way," she said in a statement.
"The changes in this permitting program will help the renewable energy industry and others develop projects that can operate in the longer term, while ensuring bald and golden eagles continue to thrive for generations."
Hutchins, however, pointed to a recent study in the Wildlife Society Bulletin estimating that 573,000 birds and 888,000 bats are killed every year by wind farms.

But Peter Kelley, vice president of public affairs for the American Wind Energy Association, said that for a wind farm to be permitted under the new rules, "you have to document all of the different ways you\'ll preserve the eagles.
This ruling sets up a system of permitting that allows, for the first time, the legal killing of bald and golden eagles.
"The Obama administration has called for 20 percent of our energy to be generated by renewables by 2030.
If it\'s not done right, what kind of an impact is that going to have on birds and bats?"
Pesticides such as DDT softened their eggshells and the birds became endangered, Hutchins said.
New threats include development around nesting areas and, now, wind power.

But, wind industry officials said Friday that the rules from the Department of the Interior were far from a "free ride."
But Peter Kelley, a spokesman for the American Wind Energy Association, said that for a wind farm to be permitted under the new rules, "you have to document all of the different ways you\'ll preserve the eagles.
The government began issuing permits in 2009 to developers of renewable energy projects.
The new regulations would extend the permits to a maximum of 30 years.
But, they will be issued only to companies that commit "to ensure the preservation of eagles," the Interior Department said.
But, much of the impact of the new rules will be felt in the West, experts say.
And the government could suspend or take away their permits.
Hutchins, however, said a recent study estimated that 573,000 birds and 888,000 bats are killed every year by wind farms.
Pesticides used to keep insects off crops softened their eggshells and the birds became endangered, Hutchins said.
New threats include construction around areas where the eagles make their nests and, now, wind power.

The incident occurred Jan. 28 at Uintah Elementary when students trying to buy lunch had their meals thrown away, angering parents and stirring outrage around the country.
Several dozen parents attended the meeting, and some said the report was vague and that the cafeteria worker put on leave was being scapegoated, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.
Police investigated several threatening phone calls made to the school following the incident, but determined they were not credible, Salt Lake City School District spokesman Jason Olsen said.
But he said the department "did fail in getting information out effectively."
Orton said meals will never be taken from kids, department policies will be followed, parents will be notified of low balances, and students can go into the red for a week and still receive meals.
"That accountability and responsibility has never been answered."
The district put a cafeteria manager and a district supervisor on paid leave as the investigation got underway last week.
"The lunchroom staff should not be held accountable for the policies implemented by their supervisors," said Lynn Lonardo, who said her daughter\'s lunch was confiscated last week.
District Superintendent McKell Withers said the leave is typical during investigations and was meant to protect the affected workers from threats.

In 2014, the average surface temperature of the Earth was the highest recorded since scientists began taking detailed measurements 135 years ago.
As water heats up, ice masses melt, causing sea levels to rise.
"It wasn\'t quite the warmest year in the land records, but combined, this did actually give the warmest year" since scientists began tracking global surface temperatures in 1880.
Last year was still the warmest ever despite a colder-than-usual U.S. winter caused by a "polar vortex," the scientific agencies said.
The colder U.S. winter was balanced out by hotter periods elsewhere throughout the year, including blazing heat that worsened the drought in the Western U.S., and heat spells in Europe and Australia.
The city of Anchorage, Alaska, did not see temperatures drop below zero degrees in 2014.
Temperatures in the far northern latitudes of the Earth: northern Canada, Russia and Scandinavia, for example, are rising twice as fast as more temperate zones closer to the equator.
Antarctic sea ice is less tied to global temperatures, Schmidt said, and more influenced by local factors including wind and fresh water from melting ice on land.
"There are going to be periods when short-term trends go up and go down \u2014 that\'s just the nature of the beast.
Tim Barnett, a marine physicist with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, said the evidence showed that warming had not taken a "hiatus," or paused, since the late 1990s.
Since then, it has increased by 0.28 degree Fahrenheit per decade, NOAA data showed.
In 2014, the average surface temperature of the Earth was the highest recorded since scientists began taking detailed measurements 135 years ago.

It showed Officer Michael Slager firing eight times as 50-year-old Walter Scott ran away from him during a traffic stop.
The shooting inflamed a national debate about how black people are treated by white police officers.
Slager was charged with murder by state law enforcement officers.
It represented at least the fourth time in less than six months that a sitting grand jury in South Carolina has agreed that white officers should stand trial in the shootings of black men.
"Today was just an example of if you keep the faith, even in the darkest times, you will see the light," he said during a news conference after the indictment.
In that case, there was no video of the shooting and Officer Darren Wilson, who fired the fatal shots, was not indicted.
Defense attorneys said it is rare for a grand jury not to indict because just 12 of the 18 jurors have to agree the person probably committed the crime.

A white former police officer will go on trial for the death of an unarmed black man.
Slager was fired from the police force immediately after the video became public.
Walter Scott\'s brother Rodney Scott said the family is "very happy and pleased" with the charges against Slager.
"Today was just an example of if you keep the faith, even in the darkest times, you will see the light," Stewart said.
After the shooting, Slager told police he tried to stun Scott with his Taser gun, but it did not work.
Slager said the two men fought over it, and he fired his handgun at Scott to defend himself.
This argument became more intense in August when Michael Brown was shot to death in Ferguson, Missouri.
Brown was an 18-year-old black teen and was not carrying a gun.
It was a one-two punch: first air pollution, and then the bureaucracy.
"We called the (local) education committee, and the Education Ministry, and we got different answers from everyone who picked up the phone," Zhang said.
"If you ban heading, yes, you will prevent some concussions in soccer, perhaps as much as 30 percent," said Dawn Comstock, an epidemiologist at Colorado School of Public Health at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
"You would actually prevent many more concussions," she said.
Although no one is entirely sure why this is the case, there are some theories.
Additionally, adult coaches and referees who spend time with student athletes may be more attentive to the health of female players than of males.
The number of students playing soccer has risen dramatically in recent years.
As the game has become more popular, it has also become more dangerous, with concussion rates rising for both male and female players.
Parents can play their part, too.
Most of the concussions that high school soccer players get are not the result of heading the ball, new research shows.
It could be that girls have less neck strength than boys, so their brains get more jostled by an impact to the head, Comstock said.
Girls may be more likely to notice the symptoms of concussions and report them to their coaches.
Almost 800,000 high school students of both sexes played on school soccer teams in the United States in 2014.
We just want to keep them as safe as possible while they do so."
Most of the concussions that high school soccer players suffer are not due to heading the ball, new research shows.
She says referees need to make sure dangerous play is not tolerated.
She also says referees must try to reduce the amount of athlete-athlete contact.
Female athletes were more likely to receive concussions than males.
Now, this Andean capital seems to be in bloom, as everything from high-art to hurried scrawls spring from overpasses, storefronts and sidewalks.
The splash of color is earning the city accolades and recognition in the art world \u2014 even as some here wonder about the line between art and vandalism.
But while fines and sanctions do exist, some say the new rules have given graffiti a veneer of legitimacy and turned Bogota into a street-artist Wild West.

Weak laws and blank walls have made it a safe haven for local and international graffiti artists.
Then last year, the mayor rolled out a law trying to regulate the practice.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has one week to reveal what kind of chemical weapons his country has and where they are being kept, under a deal struck Saturday by the United States and Russia.
Under the agreement, inspectors from the international body that monitors compliance with chemical weapons bans would have "immediate and unfettered access to inspect any and all sites in Syria."
Their initial inspections are to be completed in November.
He warned, however, that "if diplomacy fails, the United States remains prepared to act."
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said such an intervention was off the table for now.
They said it failed to hold Assad accountable for the deaths of hundreds of civilians in chemical weapons attacks.
Only two weeks ago, the United States appeared to be just hours away from sending cruise missiles into Syria in retaliation for an Aug. 21 alleged poison gas attack that killed hundreds of people.
There was little sign of acrimony when the agreement was announced on Saturday.

Still, critics scoffed Wednesday at what they viewed as self-interest wrapped in noble-sounding rhetoric that accompanied the announcement from Zuckerberg and his new Internet.org coalition.
But he said it also represents a trend in which, unlike the days when business moguls waited until they retired to become philanthropists, "now we expect our [entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) to be charitable activists."

Mount Rainier looms over Puget Sound, wooing climbers and testing their skills.
The glacier-covered volcano rises alone near Seattle, beckoning the outdoorsy.
"There is a draw, but I can\'t explain it," said Len Throop, who has climbed Rainier many times but never crested the summit.
The worst accident came in June 1981, when 11 climbers died under giant chunks of ice.
The six climbers who died last week included two experienced mountain guides from Alpine Ascents International.
The challenging terrain requires skill, endurance and special equipment.
They are often tied to their climbing mates for safety.
But he said that among the possible problems climbers face are "rock fall, avalanche, a mixture of everything in between."
"The sad fact (is), sometimes bodies are not recovered.
"And then, all of a sudden, it\'s just there on the landscape.

Liberty Ridge is very steep and long, he said.
The developer is building the first major subdivision in decades in the slow-growth university town of Davis, Calif.
The Cannery project will feature drought-tolerant landscaping along its bike paths, and most of the front yards will be landscaped with low-water plants in place of grass.
A big unknown is whether buyers will want homes without lawns, a mainstay in the Sacramento region for 150 years.
Salesmen traveled west promoting the new yard plans, he said.
The emerging middle class wanted lawns like the American aristocracy and the English gentry before them.
In its yearbook from 1897, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommended Kentucky bluegrass and described the ideal turf.
Most homeowners associations continue to insist that those lawns be maintained, even as the drought became a crisis this year and cities across the region, including Folsom and Sacramento, required homeowners to cut water consumption by 20 percent or more.
The program pays $1 a square foot to homeowners to replace irrigated turf with drought-tolerant plants, up to $1,000 per household.
The model took hold in the second half of the 19th century, when seed companies sold the idea from Maine to California, said Thomas J. Mickey, author of "America\'s Romance with the English Garden."
Well-groomed lawns in the front yards of homes became status symbols and statements about the residents who lived there.
Instead of mowing once a week she prunes a couple of times a year and sometimes replaces a plant or two, Kalinowski said.
I\'m really happy with it," she said.
Sacramento gets about as much annual rainfall as arid Flagstaff, Ariz., but its lush lawns are modeled on those of rain-soaked England.
Real estate agents would say, \'Now you can have a lawn.\'"

The same size area planted in drought-tolerant landscaping needs only 12,338 gallons of water a year, she said.
Yet, its lush lawns are modeled on those of rain-soaked England and require frequent watering.
Nudged by local governments worried about water shortages, home builders and homeowners associations are showing an increased willingness to embrace the drought-tolerant landscapes that more naturally suit California.
"A perfect lawn consists of the growth of a single variety of grass with a smooth, even surface, uniform color, and an elastic turf," wrote Frank Lamson-Scribner of the USDA.
Roseville, Calif., launched its own cash-for-grass program in 2008.
"We had a line outside the door the morning we started," said Lisa Brown, the city\'s water-conservation administrator.
For instance, Sacramento started a program that pays people to switch from grass to plants that use less water.
"We had a line outside the door the morning we started," said Lisa Brown, the city\'s water-conservation administrator.
The change saves an estimated 14 million gallons of water annually, Brown said.
A few home builders are planning development projects with less grass.

Many probably die of dehydration or other perils in the wild, but some lucky ones end up at The Rhino Orphanage, where workers become mothers to the traumatized young ones, feeding, walking and comforting them until they are ready to return to the bush.
They learn to recognize voices, sleep in a stable, feed on a milk substitute, roll in the mud and play with each other and their human minders, who try not to get knocked over by these big, rambunctious babies.
"These rhinos would be dead if there weren\'t a place to send them," Gabriela Benavides, a Mexican veterinarian at the orphanage, told The Associated Press.
Benavides spoke at an enclosure where three rhinos named Faith, Lunga and Matthew, all less than 1 year old, lounged, trotted and slurped water from containers.
The rhinos approached visitors behind a low wooden barrier, allowing themselves to be touched and stroked on the rough skin of their heads.
Poachers with machetes hacked another baby rhino more than two dozen times as it stayed near the body of its mother, but it recovered at the orphanage.
Founded in 2012, The Rhino Orphanage says it has successfully raised and released nine rhinos back into the wild.
Poachers will "go for any little bit" of horn, even from a baby rhino whose horns are emerging, said Dex Kotze, a board director of the non-profit orphanage.
On one occasion, poachers were on their way to the orphanage but their gang had been infiltrated by an undercover agent from South African intelligence and the suspects were arrested, according to Benavides, the vet.
International interns who have assisted with the rhinos turned off phone and camera location settings and did not post photographs or video onto social media websites while at the orphanage for fear of giving away its whereabouts, said Fortunate Phaka, project leader of the group called Youth 4 African Wildlife.
Limited human contact with the rhinos also assists in their return to the wild, which happens when they are 2 or 3 years old, the age at which they would usually become independent.
They learn to recognize voices, sleep in a stable, feed on a milk substitute, roll in the mud and play with each other and their human minders, who try not to get knocked over by these big, rambunctious babies.
Managers say only that it is near a golf and safari resort at the Entabeni wildlife park in Limpopo province, about a three-hour drive north of Johannesburg.
Benavides said it was rewarding to rehabilitate rhino orphans, but also stressful because, "you don\'t know what\'s going to happen to them when you finally let them go."

President Barack Obama on Wednesday paid his first visit to the Everglades, delivering an Earth Day speech that tied the threat rising seas pose for the imperiled River of Grass to wider climate change risks across the nation.
"This is not an effort necessarily to go to anybody\'s home state," White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday before the speech.
"This is an effort to raise this debate, and the truth is those Republicans that choose to deny the reality of climate change, they do that to the detriment of the people that they\'re elected to represent."
Restoration work is also becoming more critical as impacts from rising seas begin taking a toll on the wetlands.
President Barack Obama on Wednesday paid his first visit to the Everglades, delivering an Earth Day speech that tied the threat rising seas pose for the imperiled River of Grass to wider climate change risks across the nation.
The White House admits that the government has owed the project money since even before Obama took office.
A United Nations group predicts increases in temperature, sea level and ocean salinity.
She said awareness of the slow death of the Everglades could be a model for other natural areas endangered by climate change around the world.

It has a goo-spewing mouth on its belly, is covered in toxic slime, hosts a brain-eating parasite and, like any ambitious mutant monster, the New Guinea flatworm is invading the U.S. by way of sunny Miami.
"As a biologist I can handle most things, but I find this really revolting."
In his study, Justine said the worm was first reported in the U.S. on Southwest 122nd Street in Miami in June 2012.
Because it had been dry, another biologist suggested she look at night.

"Black male teachers can serve as role models, especially for black male students, but what are we going to do to support black male teachers who take on these other layers of responsibility?"
Many black principals and teachers lost their jobs."
The organizers of the Black Men Teaching Initiative hope that providing African-American middle and high school students with mentors and role models will create a snowball effect.
At a workshop here recently, 20 high school students were asked if they planned to go to college.
Meaning schools that were once only for white students would now also enroll black students.

The speedy procedure more than 1,500 miles from the border stems from a huge influx of children fleeing violence and poverty in Central America.
Only three of the 25 children who appeared before one Miami judge on a recent Friday afternoon were represented by attorneys, said Lesley Mendoza, executive director of the pro bono project of the Cuban American Bar Association.
The numbers have gradually increased to crisis proportions because countries such as Honduras have descended into lawlessness as drug trafficking escalates and violent gangs attack families, including children.
Florida immigration courts, swamped by a growing stream of unaccompanied children who illegally crossed the Southwestern border, are creating "rocket dockets" to quickly decide whether they should be sent back to their turbulent homelands.
"A lot of children are appearing before immigration judges alone, without any legal counseling," said Camila Pachon Silva, immigration attorney for the Legal Aid Society of the Orange County Bar Association.
"By having a special docket, you can move these cases, hopefully without stepping on anybody\'s rights," said Jeffrey Brauwerman, a former immigration judge and now an immigration attorney in Fort Lauderdale.

President Barack Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes in northern Iraq Thursday night, warning they would be launched if needed to defend Americans from advancing Islamic militants and protect civilians under siege.
He vowed anew not to put American combat troops back on the ground in Iraq and said there was no U.S. military solution to the crisis.
They were escorted by two F/A-18 fighters from an undisclosed air base in the region.
President Barack Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes in northern Iraq Thursday night, warning they would be launched if needed to defend Americans from advancing Islamic militants and protect civilians under siege.
"Today America is coming to help," he declared.
President Barack Obama on Thursday approved U.S. military airstrikes against Islamic fighters in northern Iraq.
The president also wants to help protect Americans in the area.
Even so, he explained that airstrikes might be needed if the Islamic fighters attack Irbil.
However, officials said the White House was in contact with some lawmakers.
They included the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, and Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate.
Some Republicans have specifically called for the president to take action and have said he does not need the approval of lawmakers.

Some advocates hope that victories on the ballot, especially in four Republican strongholds, will change the national narrative of the economic debate.
"It becomes a lot harder for members of Congress who might not support these kinds of things to continually say \'no\' when it comes up in Washington," said Josh Levin, a vice president at the left-leaning Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which supports activists on state ballot measures.
Earlier this month, fast-food workers across the country participated in a strike in favor of a $15-per-hour "livable" wage, more than double the current federal floor of $7.25.
Activists must be realistic about what increases they push for at the polls, said Peggy Shorey, the director of state government relations at the AFL-CIO, whose state federations support the ballot initiatives.
Ten states, including Florida and Washington, have minimum wages legally tied to CPI metrics, according to the Department of Labor.
Instead, the minimum hourly rates would top off at $8.50 per hour in 2017 in Arkansas and $9 per hour in 2016 in Nebraska under their ballot proposals.
"Our polls would indicate we have a lot of work to do to educate people on some of our concerns," said Michael Held, a lobbyist with the South Dakota Farm Bureau, which opposes that state\'s proposal.
In August, 58 percent of surveyed potential Alaskan voters supported the state initiative there, according to Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling firm.
Five Southern states \u2014 South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama \u2014 have no state minimum wage at all, deferring to the federal rate.

Last year, about 91,000 workers earned the federal minimum wage or below in the four states with November ballot proposals, according to the government.
It would stop at $9 per hour in 2016 in Nebraska under their ballot proposals.
If Republican states pass minimum wage increases, it shows that the issue does not have to split the two parties, she said.

The Seattle City Council passed a $15 hourly rate in June.
South Dakota would raise the minimum wage based on changes to a national measure of the cost of living called the CPI.
Others are scheduled to follow in upcoming years.
It is a national law called the minimum wage.
They think it will make it harder for Congress to keep voting against a national increase.
But there are differences in how the increases would work.

Arkansas is more open to changing ways than other Southern states, he said.
When Audrey Dimitrew won a spot on a club volleyball team in Chantilly, Virginia, the 16-year-old hoped to impress varsity coaches and possibly college coaches.
In recent years, families have increasingly turned to the courtrooms to resolve youth sports disputes.
Parents are spending thousands of dollars and giving up countless weekends so kids can participate on travel teams and prestigious high school programs.
Project Play, a group trying to get more kids involved in sports, estimates the average travel team parent is spending about $2,300 a year, while those of the most elite players lay out $20,000 a year or more.
Experts say parents want proof that their investment is paying off.
The coach told Audrey she was not ready to be a setter on the team and would not play much for the rest of the season, even though she had "college level" skills, according to court documents.
The family was disappointed, perplexed and felt they had not been given what they were promised after a significant investment.
A 2014 ESPN Project Play poll found around 70 percent of parents thought youth sports were too expensive and time-consuming and placed too much emphasis on winning over having fun.
Fairfax County Judge John Tran was sympathetic to Audrey\'s situation, saying he was "unhappy ... that a child is not given an opportunity to play."
The ruling effectively meant Audrey would not play this season, but Susan Dimitrew said the fight will continue.
When Audrey Dimitrew won a spot on a club volleyball team in Chantilly, Virginia, the 16-year-old hoped to impress varsity coaches and possibly college coaches.
Parents are spending thousands of dollars and giving up countless weekends so kids can participate on travel teams and prestigious high school programs.
The dispute began after Audrey and about 75 other girls competed for spots on the under-16 Chantilly Juniors in November.
The coach told Audrey she was the best setter at the tryout and would get playing time, according to court documents.
The coach told Audrey she was not ready to be a setter on the team and would not play much for the rest of the season, even though she had "college level" skills, according to court documents.
The coach gave Audrey two options: She could be a practice player for the Juniors or transfer to another team in the league.
Sixteen-year-old Audrey Dimitrew recently won a spot on a club volleyball team in Chantilly, Virginia.
She hoped to impress top high school coaches and possibly catch the eye of college coaches.
The league has said that Audrey is just upset about not getting playing time, and if it allows her to switch teams then many other players will want to as well.
Parents are spending thousands of dollars and giving up countless weekends for kids to participate on travel teams and prestigious high school programs.
They are hardly alone.
Parents of the most elite players might spend $20,000 a year or more.
When the season began, Audrey got practice play with her own team, but was on the bench for the first two competitive tournaments in mid-January.
The coach told Audrey she was not ready to be a setter on the team and would not play much for the rest of the season, even though she had "college level" skills, the court documents said.

Others say Disney could allow parents to amass return times for several attractions at once, though doing so might invite more abuse.
"Goodness gracious, you can\'t hurt kids with disabilities because you have able-bodied people abusing the system or cheating.
But the trip has become a source of anxiety for his father, Brad Doyle, because Disney said recently it would stop allowing disabled guests to jump ahead in lines at the attractions in its U.S. theme parks.
It might seem a minor change to most families.
Parents say there must be a better solution.
Some suggest making families apply for the cards before they arrive in the parks.
"Goodness gracious, you can\'t hurt kids with disabilities because you have able-bodied people abusing the system or cheating.
Disney recently said it would stop allowing disabled guests to jump ahead in lines at its attractions.
Soon after, Disney found that close to a quarter of all the visitors riding Radiator Springs Racers in Cars Land were using a guest assistance card.
It admits that the number of people asking for them has grown "substantially" during the past few years.
Disney released the statement Friday in an open letter to organizations that help disabled people.
"There has to be some sort of middle ground," said Don La Vette of Joliet, Ill. She has an 11-year-old son with autism and language and coordination problems.
"Goodness gracious, you can\'t hurt kids with disabilities because you have able-bodied people abusing the system or cheating."

Disney says hundreds of thousands of people ask for assistance cards annually.
Disney is seen as among the most friendly companies in the world for disabled visitors.
But they let a disabled guest and his or her party immediately enter the FastPass line.
They may also be able to use an alternative entrance.
But when they show those cards to employees at ride entrances, they will then be given a time to return.

Taher, a 15-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank, never met an Israeli before he came to Chicago.
"It makes me feel not strong or not free," said Taher of the conflict between Palestinians and Israel and also living in the West Bank.
Most recently, Israel and the militant Hamas group that governs Gaza have been in a fierce fight.
To date, more than 400 teenagers from the Middle East have participated in the program.
While the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians is often in the background, this is one of the first times the program has taken place when the two sides are actually fighting, said Roy Gordon, who works for the program.
"Most of these young people have never had a conversation with someone on the other side because their lives are so segregated there," Gordon said.

In Seattle, eight activists between ages 10 and 15 petitioned Washington state last year to adopt stricter science-based regulations to protect them against climate change.
"I don\'t think this litigation is going to be successful because climate change is a global problem, and it\'s not clear what a state could do," added Richard Stewart, a law professor at New York University.
In August, 21 youths across the country sued the federal government, alleging that approval of fossil fuel development has violated the fundamental right of citizens to be free from government actions that harm life, liberty and property.
The EPA did not comment on specifics of the lawsuit but said in a statement that President Barack Obama and the agency have been taking action to "give our kids and grandkids the cleaner, safer future they deserve."

NBC "Nightly News" anchor Brian Williams was suspended for six months without pay for exaggerating his role in a helicopter incident in Iraq, marking the first time a network news anchor has been stripped of his duties.
Specifically, NBC News President Deborah Turness confirmed in the memo that Williams "misrepresented events" from his original report from Iraq.
He described seeing a body floating through the French Quarter of New Orleans and fending off marauding gangs at the hotel where he stayed.
One NBC News executive not authorized to discuss the matter publicly said it would be "a period of reflection" for Williams.
The blow of losing Williams for a while will be felt more in the morale at NBC News.
In December, he was rewarded with a five-year contract that pays him about $10 million a year.

In a Federal Bureau of Prisons first, inmates serving time in a Miami federal detention center were allowed to dance with their daughters for an afternoon as part of a re-entry program.
"I haven\'t seen my girls in months, I could not believe how much they have grown," said Williams, 37, convicted of intent to sell crack cocaine.
"You are a key to the success of your father," Federal Bureau of Prisons Director Charles E. Samuels Jr. told the 20 girls, aged 4 to 18, who had assembled to meet their fathers, all nonviolent offenders.
In a third-floor prison meeting space transformed into a ballroom with a fairy-tale theme, 13 fathers in suits and ties and tuxedos spent two hours with their girls, this long-held tradition unfolding without the harshness of uniforms and visiting rooms and prison walls.
The father of three daughters has been in prison almost three years for cargo theft and is scheduled to enter a halfway house in January.
They arrived with their mothers and grandmothers wearing fancy dresses, the littlest ones in pastel gowns and patent leather shoes.
Later, they were escorted to the third-floor, multi-purpose room, decorated with purple ribbons, glitter paper chandeliers and a big cardboard cutout carriage \u2014 the handmade gifts of a group of female inmates.
Returning to a strong, engaged family gives inmates their best shot at starting over.
"You hope this will be transformational, that this dance gives these fathers something to look forward to," said Walter T. Richardson, the Miami-Dade Police Department chaplain who delivered the keynote address.
An hour after the dance and just before lock down, Anthony Martin, 33, a father of two young girls, sits quietly.
One of his daughters is crying, head in her hands.
"She misses me and I love her so much," he says, comforting the 8-year-old.

The images out of the Copenhagen Zoo on Sunday were startling.
All plants and animals have genes, which play a big part in what we look like.
Genes determine eye color, hair color, athletic ability, health and more.
"In Copenhagen Zoo we let the animals breed naturally," said Bengt Holst, the zoo\'s scientific director, in the statement.
One thing is clear: Wal-Mart and other U.S. retailers will probably have to take on a bigger role in enforcing worker standards, a potentially costly prospect.
But on the other hand they feel that consumers care and want the retailer to assure whatever is sold in their stores meets certain standards."
"When you go down to these places, you basically see what they choose to show you," said Devon Zagory, a produce industry consultant who has audited farms in Mexico.
Monitoring systems that focus on surprise or multiple inspections annually and interviewing workers are among the best ways to get a clearer picture of labor conditions, say experts.
Some growers with good reputations on labor issues say, though not publicly, that Wal-Mart consistently partners with producers with the lowest prices, regardless of labor conditions.
Such an approach is risky, as more consumers demand that their food be produced in an ethical manner.
The extra cost is less damaging than the tarnished reputation of being linked to labor abuses, for Wal-Mart as well as other retailers, said Emily Miggins, a former sustainability manager at Safeway.
Experts said American retailers should work together to reach a consensus on basic worker welfare standards.
It is unclear how much it would cost agribusinesses, which number in the hundreds, to create better living conditions for produce workers.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday said that Russia should turn Snowden over.
How can Snowden travel at all without a valid U.S. passport?
Assange told the _New York Times_ that WikiLeaks arranged for Ecuador to issue Snowden a "special refugee travel document" a week ago.
"The U.S. government is spying on each and every one of us, but it is Edward Snowden who is charged with espionage for tipping us off," he said.
U.S. authorities want to arrest Snowden on charges of espionage and theft.
When Daniel Promislow jogs with his Weimaraner, Silver, it pains him to see age creeping up on the 11-year-old canine.
"Month by month, he gets slower and slower," said Promislow, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Washington (UW).
"We\'re not talking about doubling the healthy life spans of pets," said UW molecular biologist Matthew Kaeberlein.
Large-scale human trials are costly and would take decades to complete.
But with dogs, who suffer from many of the same old-age ailments as their masters, it could be possible to find out in a few years whether rapamycin is beneficial.
"I think it\'s worth a go, not just from what it can teach us about humans, but for the sake of the animals themselves," said University of Alabama Biology Department Chairman Steven Austad, an expert in aging research who is not part of the UW project.
Rapamycin functions partly by inactivating a protein that promotes cell growth, Kaeberlein explained.
As a result, cells grow more slowly, which retards the spread of cancer.
Cardiovascular effects are among the first things the researchers hope to track in dogs, Promislow said.
The researchers eventually hope to persuade hundreds of dog owners, probably in different parts of the country, to enroll their pets in a much larger experiment.
The goal would be to study the normal aging process of dogs, as well as the long-term effects of rapamycin and how the drug functions in canines.
So the UW team is looking for unconventional sources of money.
The UW project sounds logical and well-thought-out, said Dr. Jeffrey Halter, director of the University of Michigan Geriatrics Center.

Rapamycin is currently used along with several other medications in organ-transplant patients.
Nearly 50 laboratory studies have shown that the drug can delay the onset of some diseases and restore vigor to elderly animals.
But with dogs, it could be possible to find out in a few years whether rapamycin is beneficial.
"I think it\'s worth a go, not just from what it can teach us about humans, but for the sake of the animals themselves," said University of Alabama Biology Department Chairman Steven Austad, an expert on aging.
The researchers plan to start as soon as possible with an initial study of 30 large, middle-aged dogs.
The UW project sounds well-thought-out, said Dr. Jeffrey Halter, director of the University of Michigan Geriatrics Center.
He cautioned that developing new drugs and treatments for both animals and humans is a long and difficult process.
When Daniel Promislow jogs with his 11-year-old Weimaraner, named Silver, it is hard for him to see the dog get old.

At 10, though, she also is considered to be elderly for a dog.
Some dog breeds, including Newfoundlands and Dobermans, are particularly high risk for heart failure.
Most of all, the scientists are hoping dog lovers who want to improve the health of their animals would help out.
People can also sign up their dogs to possibly be included in the study.
For Daniel Promislow, it is hard to watch his 11-year-old dog, Silver, get old.
It could also take many years to get results.
However, it may help them stay healthier and more active, Promislow pointed out.
Finding money for the study could be difficult.
The government usually only pays for studies that help humans.
On the website, people can give money.
At once shocking and all too familiar, their harrowing story of bombings, executions and refugee camps before finding a safe haven in Chicago is just one of thousands coming out of the humanitarian crisis in Syria, the Middle East and Europe.
As European leaders scramble to find a solution to the flood of migrants fleeing war-torn Syria, the U.S. response also has come under scrutiny.
Placements are generally prioritized based on need, with torture victims, medical cases and protection concerns in the country of asylum ranking high.
The woman, whose husband was fatally shot by a sniper, fled the ruins of her Damascus home with her children, ages 5 to 19, after an artillery shelling.
In addition to monetary support, the agencies see refugee families daily to teach them English, help them find jobs, provide mental health care and often pair them up with a mentor in the neighborhood.
But in 2011, that all ended.
"We imagine people from Syria won\'t have coats for Chicago, so we\'re asking for coats, sweaters, boots and outerwear," Snoddy said.
For nearly four years, Fatima and Fadi Adris and their family have been fleeing the brutal civil war in their native Syria.
"We hid in destroyed buildings.
In March, the family arrived in Chicago.
Fadi Adris worked as a painter, and she went to school to learn English.
State Department officials announced in August that the United States expects to resettle 5,000 to 8,000 additional refugees from Syria next year.
In mid-September, President Barack Obama ordered his administration to accept at least 10,000 Syrian refugees next year.
The newcomers will need help with everything from school enrollment to housing to emotional support.
"We imagine people from Syria won\'t have coats for Chicago, so we\'re asking for coats, sweaters, boots and outerwear," said Kim Snoddy of RefugeeOne, the largest refugee resettlement organization in Illinois.
The money goes for home rent, heating and other costs.
The groups also teach refugees English and help them find jobs.
However, the distinguished white-haired man who sat next to her was the one who made it happen, who makes everything happen at the Library of Congress \u2014 James H. Billington.
In the age of the Internet, the title "librarian of Congress" might sound dated.
Indeed, the Library of Congress holds more than 23 million books, along with many millions of other kinds of publications, from newspapers to sheet music.
New entries on the list include classic movies such as "Saving Private Ryan," "Rosemary\'s Baby" and "Ferris Bueller\'s Day Off."
Three are located on Capitol Hill, across the street from the United States Capitol Building, while a fourth is in rural Virginia.
In addition to presenting awards celebrating American creativity, Billington has been a force behind library-sponsored events like the National Book Festival.
He oversees the cultural center where the Magna Carta \u2014 on loan from England for the "Great Charter\'s" 800-year anniversary \u2014 is on display.
"Jim has done a spectacular job in reinventing the job of librarian of Congress," said the library\'s head fundraiser, David Rubenstein.
He speaks the language and has written five books, mostly about Russia.
He wrote and narrated a PBS documentary on Russia and has traveled with members of Congress to the country, and he accompanied President Ronald Reagan to the 1988 nuclear summit in Moscow.
This week he announced 25 additions to the National Film Registry.
The princess was there to lend the library one of just four surviving original copies of the Magna Carta.
However, the distinguished white-haired man who sat next to her was the one who made it happen, and who makes everything happen at the Library of Congress: James H. Billington.
Yet the 85-year-old scholar is very much up to date.
The World Digital Library (WDL) is just one of the projects Billington has championed.
The collection represents the "intellectual and cultural creativity of the people of the United States," Billington said.
Billington has opened up the library, by making it easier for ordinary people to use and by putting so much material online, Rubenstein said.
The princess was there to lend the library one of just four surviving original copies of the Magna Carta.

In fact, the past five years have brought the deepest spending cuts Britain has seen in a generation.
"Government has had to cut back on spending while being asked to provided as much or more services," the report noted.
Although most Britons support the queen, the cost is sometimes questioned, particularly when times are tough.
For example, they could sell tickets for tours of Buckingham Palace to the curious public for more of the year.
Lawmakers said the royal family should learn to live with fewer underlings as well.
It has also accused Google, Amazon and other multinational companies of avoiding paying their share of taxes to the United Kingdom.

Civil war in Syria has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee the Middle Eastern country and seek refuge in Turkey, Lebanon and other neighboring nations.
British Prime Minister David Cameron is very worried about the conflict in Syria and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the conflict.

These toxic gasses have been used for many years in different wars.
Millions of Vietnamese were exposed and the country claims it caused thousands of birth defects.
Knowing the damage chemical weapons can cause, Obama will face pressure to flex U.S. power and influence to stop Syria from using them.
However, political experts say that President al-Assad is counting on the fact that the United States is weary of fighting in foreign wars and that Obama will not put his money where his mouth is.

Chemical weapons are a "red line" because they don\'t just kill their victims; they cause terrible suffering.
Napalm is a jelly-like substance that can burn away leaves and trees.
During the war, U.S. troops had trouble finding North Vietnamese soldiers in dense jungles.

The naturally talented flyers can reach great heights.
The scientists found that the birds did not fly in a straight line, the most direct route to their destination.
In one stretch over 15 hours, the geese rose and fell repeatedly.
The naturally talented flyers can reach great heights.
They thought he birds would not waste energy dropping down and flying back up again.
The reason is probably because flying at great heights can be very tiring.
The higher the birds flew, the more they had to beat their wings, and the more they beat their wings, the harder their hearts had to work.
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Mount_Everest_as_seen_from_Drukair2_PLW_edit.png" />Do you think flying a roller coaster is scary?
Their study determined that the birds do not fly in a straight line.
The scientists followed the geese from their home in Mongolia, a country between China and Russia.
They have to fly over deserts and oceans.
But the scientists added that only a few birds can fly across the high mountains between India and central Asia.
One goose was tracked flying more than 4 miles up in the air for a short while.
The scientists found that if the birds had gone up in straight line, they would have spent 8 percent more energy making the trip.
In the end, it seems to be better for the birds to fly low when they can, and fly high when they have to get over a tall peak.

Now the sisters have a booming business and a waiting list of Nepalese women who want to join their six-month training program for mountain guides.
The sisters once led trips themselves, but had trouble finding more women who knew trekking, spoke English and were willing to spend days walking with the foreigners away from home.
According to the Nepal Mountaineering Association, some 340,000 foreign tourists ventured on treks last year.
Now the sisters have a booming business and a waiting list of Nepalese women who want to join their six-month training program for mountain guides.
The sisters once led trips themselves, but had trouble finding more women who knew trekking, spoke English and were willing to spend days walking with the foreigners away from home.
"At the beginning it was very unusual for the women to join our program because they had to leave their homes for many days, working with Westerners," said Nicky, the youngest of the sisters.
The sisters take in 40 students every six months, giving them free housing, food and clothing.
Once they graduate, they make about $3,000 a year from guiding tourists, a better-than-average salary in this poor Himalayan nation.
"I am here to learn the skills of trekking and English language so that I can become a guide and make more money than in any other jobs," she said.

For decades, finding Spanish-language books in the U.S. was like tilting at windmills.
A paperback copy of "Don Quixote" in the original Spanish could easily cost triple the price of a deluxe hard-bound translation in English \u2014 if it could be found at all.
Retailers blamed the expense of importing books printed in Spain and Latin America.
Imported hardcovers such as Colombian author Alvaro Mutis\' "Maqroll" trilogy that once retailed for more than $100 can now be had online for less than $15.
And entire genres of Latin American literature \u2014 think contemporary Ecuadorean poetry \u2014 that were all but impossible to acquire at any price are now a few mouse clicks away.
When Luis Alcaraz bought a Kindle four years ago, he said, there was "practically nothing available to download in Spanish."
Today, the software consultant said, he finds a seemingly endless supply of interesting electronic titles in his native language, including arcane technical tomes and science fiction novellas he likes to read on flights.
In 2011, about 1 in 20 Hispanics owned such a device, the group found; in 2012, the number had jumped to nearly 1 in 5.
"Digital removes all the obstacles you have with a printed book," said Carmen Ospina, director of digital development at Random House Mondadori, which is based in Barcelona, Spain.

Before 2010, she said, only about 10,000 Spanish-language print titles were in stock at online booksellers in the U.S. out of a total of about 650,000 Spanish titles worldwide.
And in July, the paperback version of "Inquebrantable," the autobiography of deceased recording artist Jenni Rivera, hit the No.
For decades, finding Spanish-language books in the United States was tough.
Booksellers stocked few titles, and those they carried were very expensive.
The upshot was that even in heavily Latino cities such as Los Angeles, readers of "libros en espanol," which means "books in Spanish," could find little.

A series of lawsuits and a federal investigation launched in Miami this year have revealed that many ballplayers are smuggled out of Cuba by human-trafficking groups in exchange for up-front fees in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and at least the promise of a slice of future earnings.
"To start, I\'m dreaming of playing for Industriales, the greatest Cuban baseball team in my opinion, and afterward of course I\'d like to play in the major leagues."
Instead, they choose to play abroad where they have the potential to earn more money.
Recently, officials have put new policies into effect aimed at keeping Cuban players from leaving.
Up until recently, the rules have prohibited players from signing contracts in other countries.
It allows ballplayers to sign offseason contracts in countries like Japan and Mexico.
Therefore, Cuban players still cannot compete in the United States without permanently leaving the island.
This year alone, 13 Cuban players signed new major or minor league contracts, up from 10 the previous year.
Instead, they choose to play abroad where they have the potential to earn more money.
With so many gifted players leaving, the overall talent level of the league has gone down.
Overall, however, the reforms do not seem to be working.
"There\'s no way that economically Cuba is going to keep enough top players in the country to have the quality of league they had five or 10 years ago," said Peter C. Bjarkman.
The new rules allow ballplayers to sign offseason contracts in countries like Japan and Mexico.
Cuban officials hoped that these reforms would help keep talented players from leaving.
Industriales pitcher Odrisamer Despaigne, 27, left Cuba this past February.
Poor millennials.
Higher than the 32 percent who lived at home in 1968, the earliest comparable data available.
But a closer look at the 2012 Census Bureau data analyzed by Pew \u2014 and equally important, the factors driving those numbers \u2014 indicates the trend actually may be cause for celebration.
From Arnett\'s book: "In 1960 only 33 percent of young people attended college, and most of them were men; today, 70 percent of high school graduates enter college the next year.
This is partly because of a sluggish economy and partly because millennials are holding out hope for fulfilling work, experts say.
"They (prioritize) purpose, meaning and self-growth in their careers," says Varda Konstam, a professor of counseling and school psychology at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and author of "Parenting Your Emerging Adult: Launching Kids From 18 to 29" (New Horizon Press).
And those who do marry are delaying their unions \u2014 the median age for marriage today is 27 for women and 29 for men, according to the Pew Research Center.
"Emerging adults and their parents tend to have a very similar worldview," she says.

"We are confident that the policies will be upheld as lawful," White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said after the court\'s action Tuesday.
At issue is the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, which Obama said in late 2014 would allow people who have been in the United States more than five years and who have children who are in the country legally to "come out of the shadows and get right with the law."
Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. said in his court filing that allowing those rulings to stand would force millions of people "to continue to work off the books, without the option of lawful employment to provide for their families."
The lower courts decided that Texas does have the right, or standing, to sue because at least 500,000 people living in Texas would qualify for work permits and thus become eligible for driver licenses, the cost of which are subsidized by the state.
"Texas would incur millions of dollars in costs," the state said in its brief to the Supreme Court.
Still, the administration drew criticism from Democrats and immigration advocates for raids this month that resulted in the arrest of more than 120 immigrants from Central America who came to the country illegally since 2014.
The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to an election-year review of President Barack Obama\'s executive action to allow up to 5 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to "come out of the shadows" and work legally in the United States.
Texas quickly led a legal challenge to the program and has won every round in court so far.

No one was injured but about three dozen resort goers left behind car keys, medication and other personal belongings inside their luxury condominiums after the crumbling edifices were evacuated.
He said after the windows began to shatter, a guest ran into the street to flag down resort personnel.
Firefighters arriving on scene immediately went door-to-door of building 104, a three-story building of garden-style apartments, to help guests escape from the splintering and cracked building frame.
About 20 individuals \u2014 men, women and children \u2014 left behind everything they brought to their vacation rental.
All guests had been accounted for and no one was injured.
Caldwell said they were relocated to other buildings on the property.
The home was condemned and Bush was declared dead.
The hole \u2014 40 to 50 feet wide and 30 to 40 feet deep \u2014 stabilized and was just feet from Lake Killarney.
And several years before that, a sinkhole that opened up on Scott Lake swallowed enough water to make the shoreline recede dramatically in a Lakeland-area exclusive neighborhood.

Building 104 is connected to a center building that houses an elevator shaft, said Lake County Fire Chief Tony Cuellar.
The building buckled into the ground minutes after firefighters got the guests out through the center building, Cuellar said.
Firefighters are waiting for engineers to determine the damage the gaping hole caused.
The water dissolves limestone, causing sands to move through and form a hole on the surface.

For hundreds of years, human beings have speculated about whether there may be other forms of life somewhere out in the universe.
But so far, we only know of one planet, Earth, and just one star, our sun, which have the necessary conditions to sustain animals or plants.
A habitable zone is defined as the area near a star where temperatures and conditions are suitable for a planet to hold liquid water, which is very important for sustaining life.
"All these planets that we\'re finding are quite different than planets in our own solar system," William Borucki, principal investigator at NASA\'s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, told CNN.
But of the three new worlds, experts believe that Kepler-62f is the most similar to Earth and it is calculated to be only about 40 percent bigger than our planet.
Borucki added that 62f might be rocky, with polar regions, land mass and seas.
No one can be sure what sort of creatures may inhabit these huge seas.
Scientists are excited by Kepler-69c, as it seems to orbit a star that is similar to our sun.
The telescope on the Kepler mission finds new planets by watching thousands of stars simultaneously.
The brightness of a star changes in intensity when an object, such as a planet, passes in front of it.
So far, the Kepler craft has identified 122 confirmed new planets.
A light-year is a measure of distance, rather than time, and is calculated as the distance that a ray of light can travel in a vacuum in one year.
Recent astronomical finds are usually numbered first, then given more interesting titles later.
That is some inspiration for looking into space: imagine having an asteroid named after you forever.
For hundreds of years, human beings have speculated about whether there may be other forms of life somewhere out in the universe.
But the astronomers did reveal that they have found three planets, bigger than Earth, that exist in a "habitable zone."
The Kepler telescope spotted three such planets, known as Kepler-62e, 62f and 69c.
"The Kepler spacecraft has certainly turned out to be a rock star of science," said John Grunsfeld, an astronomer at NASA headquarters in Washington.
The telescope on the Kepler mission finds new planets by watching thousands of stars simultaneously.
While these planets are important discoveries, they are also a very long way from home.
The star that Kepler-62e and 62f orbit is 1,200 light-years away.
Recent astronomical finds are usually numbered first, then given more interesting titles later.
But they may turn out to be hugely important in the future.
For hundreds of years, human beings have speculated about whether there may be other forms of life somewhere out in the universe.
On April 18, NASA announced that it had made some important progress.
No, the space agency did not discover any little green men or other alien life forms.
For now, Kepler-62e, 62f and 69c are known as numbers rather than names.
For hundreds of years, human beings have speculated on whether there might be other forms of life somewhere in the universe.
But so far we only know of one planet, Earth, and just one star, our sun, which are able to sustain animals or plants.
So in 2009, NASA launched the Kepler mission, a space observatory that continuously monitors more than 150,000 stars.
The Kepler spacecraft is specifically searching for planets like Earth that could host life.
On April 18, NASA announced that it had made some important progress in answering the question, are we alone?

Evans was thinking about how good she wanted to feel when she got back on it, how the success she tasted in her rookie season as a bobsled pusher still sent chills of excitement through her mind.
With the bathroom formalities out of the way, Evans, 25, went into the gym to begin a workout with her EFT trainer, Jacob Ross.
An online search told her about upcoming bobsled combine tests in the summer of 2012.
Three months after the combine tests, Evans found herself on ice at the Olympic bobsled track in Lake Placid, New York, about to plunge into the unknown: sitting in the back of a 375-pound sled for about 50 seconds at speeds beyond 70 miles per hour.
The driver and pusher, also known as pilot and brakeman, push for 20 or 30 meters, then jump into the sled, where the pusher sits with her head down and tries not to move her upper body, which could move the sled off the line the driver is steering.
"I feel like I have gotten through the hard part, and now it\'s like a victory lap."
She was wearing a purple top, black tights, pale turquoise sneakers with purple shoelaces and a smile that flashed brightly when her face was not contorted by effort.
Evans launched her 5-foot-10, 175-pound body to the top of a stack that was 4 feet, 3 inches high.
Like many people, Aja Evans\' knowledge of bobsled had consisted of what she saw in the film "Cool Runnings," which tells the story of the even more unlikely bobsledders from Jamaica.
Erb realized her combination of skills was ideal for a sled pusher and encouraged her to try the sport.
After the first practice run, which made her feel more awkward than frightened, Evans wondered what she was doing there.
The push phase of a bobsled race lasts 50 meters of a track that is about 30 times that long.
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/AP93848837894.jpg" />It was a steamy August morning, a day when you can\'t stop imagining how good a mouthful of ice would feel.
In this session, there would be sets of box squats, in which she eventually lifted 365 pounds; sets of dead lifts up to 195 pounds; and crouching carries of a 40-pound SandBell, a weight that looks sort of like an accordion.
Three months after the combine tests, Evans found herself on ice at the Olympic bobsled track in Lake Placid, New York.
The driver and pusher, also known as pilot and brakeman, push for 20 or 30 meters, then jump into the sled.
Her uncle is longtime Major League Baseball player Gary Matthews and her cousin Gary Matthews Jr. has played baseball in the major leagues for 12 years.
"I feel like I have gotten through the hard part, and now it\'s a victory lap."
She learned more about bobsledding during the 2010 Winter Olympics.
With the encouragement of her mother, Sequocoria Mallory, Evans decided that if she made it through that second run, she would stick with it.
The pusher sits with her head down and tries not to move her upper body, which could move the sled off the line the driver is steering.
She launched herself to the top of a stack that was 4 feet, 3 inches high.
Her father, Fred, was an NAIA swimming champion for Chicago State.
He was the first black swimmer to win a national title for college athletes.
Her uncle is longtime Major League baseball player Gary Matthews and her cousin is Gary Matthews Jr., who has played baseball in the major leagues for 12 years.
"I feel like I have gotten through the hard part, and now it\'s a victory lap," she said.
She was wearing a purple top, black tights, and pale turquoise sneakers with purple shoelaces.
Then they race down a narrow, twisting track trying to get the best time.
Evans is 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighs 175 pounds.
He encouraged her to try the sport.
Her grandfather would have wanted her to, her mother said.
So one day in August, she was at a training center in Illinois.
The pusher has to be able to shove the sled at the beginning and get it off to a fast start.
Evans jumped to the top of a stack that was 4 feet, 3 inches high.
But he died at age 95, six days before the race, and she wanted to be back with her family in Chicago.

Professor James Gates delivers his big ideas in simple but striking terms.
Last year, he received a National Medal of Science from the National Science Foundation.
Last month, the Harvard Foundation bestowed on him the title of Scientist of the Year.
To make an important contribution, all scientists need to tread into new territory.
Gates, however, stands out for his ability to lead others along his path, those who work with him say.
This is thanks to his ability to explain broader connections and the bigger picture.

As U.S. health providers prepared for the arrival of two Americans infected with the deadly Ebola virus, international health officials warned Friday that the outbreak in Africa was outstripping their ability to control it.
The isolation units keep infected patients from other areas of the hospital and were built in cooperation with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Writebol was expected to arrive in Atlanta in a few days, the hospital has said.
In Africa, Dr. Margaret Chan, head of the World Health Organization, told leaders of four West African countries that the international group planned to release $100 million to fight the disease that has sickened more than 1,300 people and killed 729.
"The situation in Liberia is dire and there is almost no capacity on the ground to respond," MSF spokeswoman Sandra Murillo said in a statement.
It is spread through direct contact with the blood, organs or other secretions of infected people.
People who are infected with this hemorrhagic virus experience sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and headaches, along with vomiting and diarrhea.
"Given the health care infrastructure and our ability to isolate people who are infected and to take care of them with the proper protective equipment, it is extraordinarily unlikely that there would be an outbreak in the United States so people should not worry," Dr. Anthony Fauci said Friday.
Despite such reassurances, passersby at Emory University Hospital said they were uncomfortable with the idea of Ebola patients being treated in their hometown.
They shouldn\'t even let them across the border," she said, shaking her head.
Greg Hammock disagreed, but admitted he worried about the possibility of the virus spreading.
On Thursday, the CDC issued a statement warning against travel to the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
In a news conference Friday, President Barack Obama said U.S. officials were working to minimize any risk of Ebola spreading in this country when leaders from across Africa hold a summit next week in Washington, D.C.

People who are infected with this hemorrhagic virus experience sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and headaches, along with vomiting and diarrhea.
The disease can also cause kidney and liver failure, as well as internal bleeding.
"It\'s the lack of health care infrastructure that leads to the problems."
On Thursday, the CDC issued a statement warning against travel to the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
"We do not have effective treatment or vaccine for Ebola," said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC.

Many electronic devices should not be thrown away with regular trash because they contain hazardous materials, such as mercury and lead, which can seep into soil and groundwater.
California became the first state to pass a law mandating "e-cycling" \u2014 electronic recycling or recycling e-waste \u2014 in 2003.
Five states \u2014 Connecticut, Maine, Oregon, Vermont and Washington \u2014 have "centralized" or "convenience-based" programs requiring electronics makers to help pay for local drop-off centers.
States with recycling quotas can see unanticipated costs when a manufacturer meets its annual goal and stops paying for local programs.
As electronic devices become smaller and people hold on to them longer, there is sometimes a different problem: it may be difficult for electronics companies to collect enough recycled materials to meet the state-imposed quotas, said Allison Schumacher, a policy manager with CEA.
CRTs, a component of bulky older televisions and computer monitors, usually containing leaded glass, have largely faded out of production since 2010.
Programs in those states are supported by companies that host electronics buyback programs as well as nonprofit and local government initiatives, said Jason Linnell, director of the National Center for Electronics Recycling (NCER).

Electric car maker Tesla Motors has introduced a new autopilot system that puts the company far ahead of its competitors.
It can find a parking spot and parallel park itself.
The system will note, for example, how quickly drivers can safely navigate a particular bend in the road or where stop signs are located.
Musk added a word of caution: Drivers need to keep their hands on the wheel, and the autopilot system will chime to remind them if they do not.
He added that it will probably take government regulators longer than that to allow it.
"This is the game we\'re going to be playing, round and round, for the next five to 10 years" until a fully self-driving car is achieved, Brauer said.

Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, announced \u2014 again \u2014 his candidacy for president in a speech Monday morning at a landmark of the American evangelical movement, Liberty University.
"Today, I am announcing that I am running for president of the United States," Cruz said, about 20 minutes into a speech to students here.
That made Cruz, who has been in the Senate since 2013, the first major presidential contender to formally declare himself a 2016 candidate.
On Monday, Cruz said it again, even more officially, in person, at the convocation ceremony at Liberty University, a required event for students enrolled there.
Cruz moved around the stage, urging students to imagine scenarios in which conservative ideals prevailed on a variety of policy issues.
"Instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values, imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life, and to uphold the sacrament of marriage," he said, focusing on evangelical priorities as well as secular conservative ones.
Instead of a government that works to undermine our Second Amendment rights \u2014 that seeks to ban our ammunition \u2014 imagine a federal government that protects the right to keep and bear arms of all law-abiding Americans."
Earlier, Cruz showed his savvy for the modern media world, managing to make the announcement of something entirely unsurprising \u2014 that he is running for president \u2014 into four separate news events.
By announcing at Liberty, founded by fundamentalist icon Jerry Falwell, Cruz is also hoping to attract evangelical voters who might also be interested in slower-starting Republican candidates like former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum.
The Harvard and Princeton-educated lawyer, 44, was first elected to the Senate in 2012.
His wife, Heidi, is a managing director at Goldman Sachs and will take a leave of absence to campaign with her husband.

Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, announced \u2014 again \u2014 his candidacy for president on Monday.
He talked about the power of the American dream and rallying average people to propel his campaign forward.
The location of the announcement, at an evangelical college, showed that Cruz hopes to get young people involved in his campaign.
At the same time he will continue to show he is willing to take on both parties and will not budge in his beliefs.
Cruz decided to declare it again here at Liberty, to make it clear that he is courting young people and evangelicals and conservatives who are frustrated with Republicans in Washington.
That made Cruz, who has been in the Senate since 2013, the first major candidate to formally declare himself running in 2016.
A large field of other Republican hopefuls have been jockeying unofficially for a spot as the front-runner, including Cruz.
He has managed to beat conservative rivals like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and neurosurgeon Ben Carson to the punch.

"I think Atlanta is a natural fit for Major League Soccer," said Blank, who was serenaded by a burgeoning fan group that calls itself "Terminus Legion," a reference to the city\'s former name.
While the Chiefs won the first NASL championship in 1968, both versions struggled financially and eventually folded.
MLS Commissioner Don Garber said there was no hesitation about putting a team in Atlanta once Blank worked out a stadium deal.
Hundreds of fans turned out for a street festival before Blank and Garber arrived by helicopter for the introductory news conference, touching down on the roof of a downtown hotel overlooked Centennial Olympic Park.
His first priority is to hire a team president for the MLS venture.
"I love this one," Blank said, looking down at the red, black and gold scarf draped over his dark suit.
"We will spend a lot of time listening to our fans and trying to understand why some names are more important than others, why certain designs are more important than others, why certain logos are more important than others."
MLS Commissioner Don Garber said there was no hesitation about putting a team in Atlanta once Blank worked out a stadium deal.
It is the ninth-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. and the biggest without a top-level soccer team.
The city has a large Hispanic population and last month drew more than 68,000 fans to the Georgia Dome for a friendly match between Mexico and Nigeria.
While the new stadium is primarily designed for the Falcons, Blank stressed that it will be soccer-friendly.
Garber said there is no worry about growing too fast given the abundance of soccer talent around the world.
He will also be exploring possible locations for a state-of-the-art training facility.
Arthur Blank donned traditional soccer garb to mark his newest venture \u2014 an MLS team for Atlanta.
"There will never be an MLS game in Atlanta where NFL lines are shown on the field," Blank said, drawing a big cheer.
Arthur Blank put on traditional soccer garb on Wednesday, to mark the announcement of his new Major League Soccer team, which will be based in Atlanta.

His first task is to hire a team president for the MLS venture.
Major League Soccer announced its newest team on Wednesday, which will be based in Atlanta and begin play in 2017.
Blank said he first started talking with MLS about bringing a team to Atlanta about 10 years ago.
The discussions started again recently, after Blank said he would build a new $1 billion downtown stadium.
"I think Atlanta is a natural fit for Major League Soccer," said Blank, as a group of fans sang to him.
MLS Commissioner Don Garber said there was no hesitation about putting a team in Atlanta.
While the new stadium is mainly designed for the Falcons, Blank stressed that it will be soccer-friendly.
There will also be a team in Miami, if a group led by David Beckham can build a soccer-specific stadium there.
"I love this one," Blank said.
MLS, which has 19 teams this season, is expanding rapidly.
After 20 years in a Lakers uniform and a lifetime in basketball, Kobe Bryant determined that his aching body and his passion for the game had both grown weaker than his excitement about the future.
"I had to just accept the fact that I don\'t want to do this anymore, and I\'m OK with that," the dry-eyed, smiling Bryant said after the game.
"So I\'m not surprised that he would make the announcement now.
I think the game will be easier for him now.

At the Lakers game against the Indiana Pacers Sunday, fans received a letter from Bryant in a black and gold envelope.
"I knew that each minute of each game I wore purple and gold," the team colors.
He has played in five NBA championships and was named an NBA All-Star a total of 17 times.
Bryant added that he does not think about basketball all the time now, which make him think that it is time to move on to other things.

The mantra for Disney executives working on the company\'s $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney resort has, for years, been to create something both "authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese."
Only when the gates are thrown open next year will planners know if they chose properly.
Though Disney has had considerable success importing its films into China in recent years, a portion of the general public is still unclear on just what characters are in the Disney universe.
("We don\'t want people wandering around asking where the \'Transformers\' ride is," said one employee by way of example.)

When the park opens next year, how is it going to be specifically geared to local visitors, without alienating foreign guests?
The park incorporated a number of Chinese elements into its design and hoped to cater to local visitors with Chinese food and other services.
"We don\'t want people wandering around asking where the \'Transformers\' ride is," said one employee by way of example.
Imagineers had to dig deep for some; for the year of the sheep, for example, they found the Jolly Holiday Lambs from "Mary Poppins."
They will also offer activities such as Chinese board games and opportunities to practice calligraphy.
Near the Enchanted Storybook Castle, a restaurant called Wandering Moon Teahouse will serve Chinese cuisine.
The Voyage to the Crystal Grotto ride inside the castle will show visitors the tales of Disney princesses including the Chinese character Mulan and her dragon, Mushu.
Some of the mash-ups are unexpected, such as a live Tarzan-themed show that will incorporate Chinese acrobats.

Disney thinks the two Chinese parks will help each other, he said.
The managers building the Shanghai Disney resort say they want to build something that looks like Disney but is also truly Chinese.
Disney decided not to serve it.
Matt Almos, a Disney manager, noted that Disney tried hard to find the right way to add Chinese touches.

But the really dicey part, according to many health policy experts, is just beginning.
Some changes in the works, such as the use of new technologies and allowing mid-level medical providers to perform some functions usually reserved for doctors and dentists, should improve health care access in the long run.
According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), unless something changes rapidly, there will be a shortage of 45,000 primary care doctors in the United States (as well as a shortfall of 46,000 specialists) by 2020.
The growing medical needs of that large age group are creating a huge burden for the existing health care workforce.
The retirement of many doctors in the boomer cohort is compounding the problem.
During the course of their careers, primary care physicians earn around $3 million less than their colleagues in specialty fields, which makes primary care a less appealing path for many medical students.
As an example, according to the National Council for Behavioral Health, a registered nurse working in mental health earns $42,987 as compared to the national average for nurses of $66,530.
A steady stream of negative attention has made medicine in general a far less attractive career choice than it once was, according to Rosenberg of the National Council for Behavioral Health.
Despite the shortages, many believe that new technologies will extend the reach of medicine in ways that will ameliorate the problem.
For example, health care professionals can serve more people by using Skype or other telemedicine technologies to examine, treat and monitor patients.
Similarly, patients can be fitted with electronic devices that remind them to take their medications and provide other guidance about their conditions.

But the really dicey part, according to many health policy experts, is just beginning.
Sixteen percent live in areas with too few dentists, and a whopping 30 percent are in areas that are short of mental health providers.
Under federal guidelines, there should be no more than 3,500 people for each primary care provider; no more than 5,000 people for each dental provider; and no more than 30,000 people for each mental health provider.
According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), unless something changes rapidly, there will be a shortage of 45,000 primary care doctors in the United States (as well as a shortfall of 46,000 specialists) by 2020.

Christiane Mitchell, who works in government affairs at the AAMC, predicted that many of the estimated 36 million Americans expected to gain coverage under Obamacare will endure long wait times to see medical providers in their communities.
Mitchell said the AAMC pushed for the government to pay for the training of additional doctors.
Sixteen percent live in areas with too few dentists.
Many primary care doctors and dentists do not accept Medicaid patients because they get paid less to treat them.
In mental health, the problem is that much of the work is in government jobs.
Yet, the national average for nurses is $66,530.
Medicaid is government-funded health insurance for poor people.
Or, they will have to travel far from home for appointments elsewhere.

They are doctors who just treat certain health problems.
In some ways, the lack of providers is worse than the numbers indicate.
And many of the newly insured will be covered through Medicaid.
Christiane Mitchell is a director at the AAMC.
There are various reasons for the shortfalls of doctors.
"Nowadays," Rosenberg said, "the best and the brightest" are talking about becoming bankers, or getting technology jobs by "going off to Silicon Valley."
There may not be enough doctors and dentists to treat all these new patients.
One big reason is the aging of the baby boomers.
There may not be enough doctors and dentists to treat all the new patients.

They discovered that koalas behaved differently on hot days than on cooler days.
In the summer heat, the animals arranged themselves in trees in a way that exposed more of their surface area.
In the winter, koalas ventured higher up in the tree and farther out onto the branches.
This seemed to explain why koalas stayed closer to the base of the tree in the summer and ventured farther up the tree in winter.
As it happens, these were the trees where koalas spent 29 percent of their time in the summer but only 5 percent of their time in the winter.
That could mean the difference between life and death when water was scarce.
Knowing this will help humans predict how animals will adapt to a warming climate.
People would also have some of the information they need to decide what kinds of habitat are most critical to preserve, the researchers added.
In the winter, koalas ventured higher up in the tree and farther out onto the branches.
Why would different parts of the tree be appealing in different seasons?
The trunks were also cooler than the surrounding air.
Of all the trees tested, the coolest ones were the Acacia mearnsii trees, the scientists found.
They discovered that koalas behaved differently on hot days than on cooler days.
The authors of the study guessed that koalas must do something to cool off in hot weather.
To figure out what that was, they put radio collars on 37 koalas in southeastern Australia.

Have you ever been befuddled by a feature on your iPhone, only to have your 6-year-old show you how it works?
Most children have been using smartphones and digital tablets practically since birth \u2014 literally.
Fully 36 percent of parents who answered a recent survey said their children had "touched or scrolled a screen" before they had celebrated their first birthday.
An additional 33 percent of parents said their kids had done so when they were 1 year old.
Only 2 percent of the parents surveyed said they had waited until their children were 4 to introduce them to the wonders of the touch-screen.
Still, 77 percent of them said they had a smartphone, 83 percent had a tablet and 59 percent had Internet access.
Likewise, 36 percent of the kids started playing video games when they were 2.
If the children enjoyed playing with the digital devices, the parents seemed to benefit too.
Nearly two-thirds of the parents said they handed over their mobile media gadgets to calm their children, and 29 percent said they used them to get their children to sleep.
The American Academy of Pediatrics says that children should avoid screens until they turn 2.
In fact, 13 percent of the parents who took the survey had not finished high school.

Yet another theory says that hunters used the early dogs as helpers.
At first, the wolves were only interested in the dead animals and scraps of meat left behind by the hunters.
They also may have kept other wild animals away from humans, Wayne said.
Archaeologists found the skeleton of an elderly man cradling a puppy.
Understanding where dogs came from is definitely harder than studying humans, said Greger Larson.

Personal transportation is on the cusp of its greatest transformation since the invention of the internal combustion engine.
Hidden under hoods and dashboards are sensors that take the first steps toward self-driving cars.
Passengers of the future may well view vehicles as just another form of public transportation, to be purchased by the trip or in a subscription.
Buying sexy, fast cars for garages could turn into buying seat-miles in appliance-like pods, piloted by robots, parked in public stalls.
In the shorter term, look for companies such as Enterprise Rent-A-Car and Uber to compete with car dealers, taxi companies and even automakers.
Schwartz believes that California may dedicate lanes to self-driving vehicles within 10 years.

Then, he said, doubters asked: Why would anyone want to replace a horse "trustily pulling your comfortable carriage with an unreliable, oil-spurting heap of gears, belts and chains?"
The rapid application of computing power to transportation will open the industry to new entrants.
A glimpse of the coming revolution can be seen in the models debuting this week at the Los Angeles Auto Show.
Buying sexy, fast cars for garages could turn into buying seat-miles in appliance-like pods, piloted by robots, parked in public stalls.
This transformation will change how designers style and equip cars, said Harald Belker, a former Mercedes-Benz designer.
Belker now creates cars for science-fiction movies including "Iron Man 2" and "Total Recall."
The automobile, Boeckmann said, is among the "few mechanical objects that people fall in love with."
Others might have a big family to haul around.
Then, he said, doubters asked: Why would anyone want to replace a horse "trustily pulling your comfortable carriage with an unreliable, oil-spurting heap of gears, belts and chains?"
Currently, most cars sit idle, requiring storage, at least 22 hours a day.

Three goggle-wearing conservators zap away dirt from the marble maidens with custom-designed lasers, as tourists watch the operation on monitors.
The restoration work is surrounded by a white fabric screen to protect visitors from laser beams, which can cause permanent eye injury.
Acropolis Museum director Dimitris Pantermalis said the main reason for cleaning the sculptures on the spot was to avoid the potential hazards of moving them.
Visitors are impressed: "The fact that it was in situ, taking place in the museum, it does bring it home to you the actual level of care that is needed to bring these back to life," said British tourist Trevor Richards, from Manchester.
It takes about seven months to cleanse each of the larger than life-sized statues, which were carved around 420 B.C.
"It\'s done with very great care to avoid any possible damage."
The technique combines two infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths, to avoid causing discoloration or abrasion.
"The laser beam hits the black crust formed on the surface of the statues over the years, and that absorbs energy and disintegrates," said conservator Costas Vassiliadis, who heads the six-strong team.
Sometimes they get unwelcome intrusions.

Killer whales in SeaWorld parks die early while their counterparts in the wild live as long as humans.
The company asserts this to show that it provides a healthy and stimulating environment for the 29 orcas it owns at four marine parks.
Several peer-reviewed studies conducted by U.S. and Canadian government researchers have calculated average life expectancies for killer whales in the Pacific Northwest.
But the numbers can change depending on which specific population was studied and during what period.
The maximum lifespan has been estimated at up to 90 years for females and 70 years for males, depending on the study.
But with the limited information available, scientists say it can be misleading to compare life expectancies between whales in the wild and those in parks.
Instead, they say, the more accurate comparison to use is the "annual survival rate."
That survey found that a population of orcas off the southern Alaskan coast had annual survival rates generally of 97 to 99 percent, depending on their age.
The best known peer-reviewed study comparing annual survival rates between wild and captive killer whales was published in 1995.
Using federal government records, the authors calculated an annual survival rate of a little more than 93 percent for captive orcas.
Put another way: Captive whales were dying at a rate of more than 6 percent a year, close to three times the rate at which wild whales were dying.
That study continues to be widely cited today by animal rights groups and other activists.
He added that newer studies seem to show that captive-born whales, in particular, appear to be surviving at about the same rate as wild whales.
The annual survival rate for killer whales held at SeaWorld facilities since the 1960s is substantially lower.
Killer whales in SeaWorld parks die early while their counterparts in the wild live as long as humans.
"This is a debate, but you have to debate with facts," added Hargrove, who appears on screen in "Blackfish."
But the numbers can change depending on which specific population was studied and during what period.
Individual whales can live much longer.
The best known peer-reviewed study comparing annual survival rates between wild and captive killer whales was published in 1995.
But newer studies suggest that captive whales are doing better.
Killer whales in SeaWorld parks die early while their counterparts in the wild live as long as humans.
The truth is not nearly as simple as either side claims.
But newer studies suggest that captive whales are doing better.
This was based on numbers from up to November 2013.
Both SeaWorld and activists are using numbers to make their case.
But the numbers can change depending on which population was studied and during what period.
Instead, they say, the better comparison to use is the "annual survival rate."
That is, essentially, an estimate of how many whales in a population can be expected to live through the year.
The best known peer-reviewed study comparing annual survival rates was published in 1995.
That study is still cited today by animal rights groups and other activists.
There are at least nine genetically distinct "ecotypes," said Brad Hanson.

In Paris, the Louvre unveiled a preview Tuesday of the art that the Abu Dhabi project has acquired since 2009.
French President Francois Hollande inaugurated the exhibition of some 160 works entitled "Birth of a Museum."
It includes a 19th-century Yemeni Torah, a 13th-century Gothic Bible as well as a swath of Renaissance and modern masterpieces by artists such as Yves Klein, Rene Magritte and Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso).
However, skeptics in France say the nation known for its nouveau riche society can\'t simply buy its way into being "cultured."

Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Thursday ordered the military to open all combat jobs to women, rebuffing requests by the Marine Corps to exclude women from certain front-line combat jobs.
Carter said he came to a different conclusion, but he said the integration of women into the combat jobs will be deliberate and methodical and will address the Marine Corps concerns.
In a prepared statement, Dunford said he provided his best military advice on the issue and now his focus is "to lead the full integration of women in a manner that maintains our joint war-fighting capability, ensures the health and welfare of our people, and optimizes how we leverage talent across the joint force."
While noting that, on average, men and women have different physical abilities, Carter said the services must assign tasks and jobs based on ability rather than on gender.
The decision comes after several years of study and will wipe away generations of limits on how and where women can fight for their country.
The Army, Navy and Air Force have moved steadily toward allowing women to serve in all posts, and only the most risky jobs remain closed.
As Marine commandant, Dunford was the only service chief to recommend that some front-line combat jobs stay male-only, according to several U.S. officials.
But the senior defense official said that while Carter recognizes there may be difficulties in opening the jobs to women, he has made his decision and all the services will follow it.
For that reason, the defense secretary said the military should recruit women into as many specialties as possible.

Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Thursday ordered the military to open all combat jobs to women, rebuffing requests by the Marine Corps to exclude women from certain front-line combat jobs.
He was formerly the Marine Corps commandant and had argued that the Marines should be allowed to keep women out of certain front-line combat jobs.
In a statement, Dunford said that he had provided his best military advice on the issue.
In October, he told U.S. troops in Sicily, Italy, that limiting his search for qualified military candidates to just half the population would be "crazy."
He had given Dunford until the end of October to forward his review on which jobs, if any, should remain closed to women.
Dunford had been the only service chief to recommend that some front-line combat jobs stay male-only, according to several U.S. officials.
Carter had pledged to thoroughly review the recommendations, particularly those of the Marine Corps.
However he said he generally believes that any qualified candidate should be allowed to compete for jobs.
For that reason, the defense secretary said, the military should recruit women into as many specialties as possible.

"I was flying through the air, somersaulting, and everything was upside down and backwards," he told NBC News on Friday.
"He was doing a lot of bailing in order to keep the boat up," Davis told the Los Angeles Times.
He survived on some limited food on board: flour pancakes fried on a propane stove and raw fish he caught with a hand net, Davis said.
He rationed his food and water, drinking just a pint a day for long stretches, The Associated Press reported, and collected rainwater.
"For such a long time I was so thirsty," he told WAVY.com early Friday.
"And I was almost out of water, and every day I was like, \'Please God, send me some rain, send me some water.
... And finally, right before I ran out of water, finally the conditions were perfect.\'"
"They saw me on the front of my boat, standing up there waving my arms, and they turned that huge skyscraper around," Jordan told NBC News Friday.
"I was afraid that you guys were crying and sad that, you know, I was dead, and I wasn\'t dead," he told his father.
Back at home in North Carolina on Friday, his stepfather said Jordan was looking forward to seeing family and eating barbecue and organic strawberry ice cream again.

"I got down onto the deck, and he walked right up to me," said Kyle McCollum, a rescue swimmer for the Coast Guard, who hoisted Jordan off the ship.
In the helicopter, Jordan pulled out two of the things that he said had kept him going: the Bible, battered and jacket-less, and a blanket that had shielded him from the sun.

President Barack Obama announced plans Thursday to keep nearly 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan through most of next year and 5,500 when he leaves office in 2017, casting aside his promise to end the war on his watch and instead ensuring he hands off the conflict to a successor.
Britain has invested nearly $6.7 million to jump-start research in the London-Oxford-Cambridge area.
They added a salt and sugar solution to the mold to mimic the somewhat sponge-like texture of a natural nose.
The team is creating other body parts including coronary arteries and ears.
Today children who need new ears must undergo invasive surgery, says Griffin.
"I\'m convinced engineered organs are going to be on the market soon," said Suchitra Sumitran-Holgersson, a professor of transplantation biology at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.
"People think your nose is very individual and personal but this is something that we could mass produce like in a factory one day."
In a north London hospital, scientists are growing noses, ears and blood vessels in a bold attempt to make body parts in the laboratory.
So far, only a handful of patients have received the London-made body parts, including tear ducts, blood vessels and windpipes.
Britain has invested nearly $6.7 million to increase research in the London-Oxford-Cambridge area.
The material used to make the organs is a chemical mixture called a polymer.
Last year, Seifalian and his team used that polymer material to mold a nose for a British man who had lost his when he got sick with cancer.
They added a salt and sugar solution to the mold to recreate the sponge-like feel of a natural nose.
Scientists have to perfect noses and ears before making more complicated body parts, explains Eileen Gentleman.
Among the more complicated body parts to create are kidneys, lungs and livers.
She has transferred lab-made blood vessels into a handful of patients.

"We will do everything we can to rescue everyone trapped in there, no matter they\'re still alive or not, and we will treat them as our own families," Hubei military region commander Chen Shoumin said at a news conference shown live on CCTV.
Zhang, the tour guide, said in an interview with Xinhua from his hospital bed that he grabbed a life jacket with seconds to spare as the ship listed in the storm, sending bottles rolling off tables, and suddenly turned all the way over.
Some survivors swam ashore, but others were rescued after search teams climbed on the upside-down hull and heard people yelling for help from within more than 12 hours after the ship overturned.
The 65-year-old woman was rescued by divers who took an extra breathing apparatus up into the bowels of the ship and spent about five minutes teaching her how to use it before bringing her out to safety, Chen said.
Their relatives gathered in Shanghai at a travel agency that had booked many of the trips, and later went to a government office to demand more information about the accident before police broke up the gatherings.

It sounds like something from a horror film: A beautiful, feathery-looking species of fish with venomous spines and a voracious appetite sweeps into the Gulf of Mexico, gobbling up everything in its path.
"The invasive lionfish have been nearly a perfect predator," says Martha Klitzkie, director of operations at the nonprofit Reef Environmental Education Foundation, or REEF, headquartered in Key Largo, Florida.
"Because they are such an effective predator, they\'re moving into new areas and, when they get settled, the population increases pretty quickly."
According to a 2012 study by Oregon State University, native prey fish populations along nine reefs in the Bahamas fell an average of 65 percent in just two years.
Their stripes are unique, like those of a zebra.
They hover in the water, hanging near coral heads or underwater structures where reef fish flourish.
Ambush predators, they wait for prey fish to draw near, then gulp them down in a flash.
In the South Pacific, predators and parasites keep lionfish in check.
The few groupers that have been spotted taste-testing lionfish have spit them back out, Johnston says.
Each one contains the contents found in the stomach of a lionfish collected in the Flower Garden Banks.
They like crevices and hidy-holes but can find that on anything from a coral head to a drilling platform to a sunken ship.
The impacts of their invasion could become widespread, scientists warn.
It\'s a snowball effect of negativity."
\u2014\u2014\u2014 The only known way to keep lionfish populations in check here, scientists say, is human removal.
Participants have collectively removed more than 12,000 lionfish since the series started in 2009.
In the Gulf, researchers like Johnston have special permits that allow them to remove lionfish when they spot them in the Flower Garden Banks sanctuary, but they need help.

The War on Poverty has alleviated some of the economic despair that existed when President Lyndon Johnson declared "all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United States" in January 1964.
Arkansas also remains above average at 20.1 percent.
"There has been some catch-up over the decades," Ziliak said.
In 2012, its rate was 10.3 percent \u2014 no longer lowest in the nation (New Hampshire, at 8.1 percent, held that distinction), but among the lowest.
Nationally, it shows a similar poverty rate, but some states with low official rates have a higher rate under the supplemental measure, which is an average of rates from 2010-2012.
California, with its high cost of living, is worst at 23.8 percent by the supplemental measure, more than 7 percentage points higher than its official rate.
New Jersey and Florida also see their poverty rates jump by more than 4 percentage points, to 15.5 percent and 19.5 percent, respectively.
The biggest change has been in the West, which had 14.6 percent of poor Americans in 1969 but 23.8 percent of them in 2012.
Both states also have slightly lower levels of educational attainment for residents than the national average, according to Census figures.
On the other hand, some of the states that were poorest in 1959 and today appear much better under the supplemental measure, underscoring how safety-net programs can keep families above the poverty line.
Poverty experts and advocates for the safety net credit programs that prop up family incomes.
"We\'re doing the best we can to fight poverty, and we\'re doing a pretty good job," said Timothy Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin, who says that debates about the War on Poverty should focus on the broader measure and benefits of the safety net.
In 2012, its rate was 10.3 percent \u2014 no longer lowest in the nation (New Hampshire, at 8.1 percent, held that distinction), but among the lowest.
A few factors could explain why: The two states rank in the top 10 nationally for share of population under 65 years old without health insurance, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data.
The Census, for example, has said 5 million more Americans would have been considered poor in 2012 without food stamps, a program that was part of the War on Poverty, not to mention other safety-net benefits.

The War on Poverty has alleviated some of the economic despair that existed when President Lyndon Johnson declared "all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United States" in January 1964.

In 2012, its rate was 10.3 percent \u2014 no longer lowest in the nation (New Hampshire, at 8 percent, held that distinction), but among the lowest.
Stateline then looked at state-by-state poverty levels from 1980 to 2012 from a government survey.
Louisiana and Georgia, for example, each had official poverty rates of nearly 40 percent in 1959.
Both states also have slightly lower education levels for residents than the national average, according to Census figures.

In January 1964, President Lyndon Johnson declared "all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United States."
The poverty level is the minimum amount of money that people need to live on.
But a Stateline study found that some states are still much worse off.
This underscores how government programs can keep families above the poverty line.

While free-roaming dogs are a global issue, it has been spotlighted in Sochi because of reports that Olympic organizers hired contractors to exterminate at least 2,000 animals.
Most of the canines are friendly instead of the teeth-baring wild dogs that often run in packs \u2014 which explains why a number of visiting athletes are among those trying to help.
"It makes me sad seeing dogs on the streets," said Brita Sigourney, a Carmel, Calif., athlete who will compete Thursday in the new extreme sport of ski halfpipe.
Sigourney, 24, found two adolescent dogs near the athletes village in the Caucasus Mountains, and well, it was love at first sight.
She returned to the spot a few days later to check on her new friends and only found one of the dogs.
Silver medalist freeskier Gus Kenworthy plans to take five dogs home that he picked up on the streets of Rosa Khutor, close to the Olympic mountain venues.
The situation has propelled Sochi residents such as Dina Filippova, 28, to act well before the games opened Feb. 6.
A part-time lawyer, Filippova quit a management job to spearhead a campaign to save street dogs.
That includes chauffeuring dogs out of Sochi under the cover of night to get them to safe places where they can find good homes.
She has been working for the past five years to get officials to build a permanent city-run shelter, but nobody wants to help, she said.
A likable hound found Sunday hanging outside the door of a cafe in the Olympic Park probably would have agreed that food is everywhere.

In an op-ed that appeared Friday in the Washington Post, Rouhani urged world leaders "to make the most of the mandate for prudent engagement that my people have given me, and to respond genuinely to my government\'s efforts to engage in constructive dialogue."
He will come accompanied by a Jewish Iranian legislator, Siamek Morsadegh.
Rouhani used his Twitter account this month to send best wishes to Jews celebrating the Rosh Hashana holiday, a move unimaginable under Ahmadinejad.
"After eight years of an erratic, unpredictable president who would say outlandish things, you have a normal person as the president of Iran," said Haleh Esfandiari, a former political prisoner under Ahmadinejad who now heads the Middle East program at the nonpartisan Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.
Rouhani\'s appeal \u2014 it\'s already being called "Rouhanimania" \u2014 is apparent in the huge demand for tickets to a dinner he will have with several hundred Iranian Americans in New York.
Whether Rouhani is simply presenting a more moderate face to the world or is open to real compromise to end the nuclear dispute is still unclear.
He speaks English well, having lived in Scotland in the 1990s as a PhD candidate.
In his recent public comments and Twitter postings, Rouhani has tried to appeal to the West without upsetting hard-liners at home.
They apparently want sanctions eased enough that they could reconnect to the global clearinghouse for international financial transactions called SWIFT, to enable them to send money around the world for business.
The White House says it has not scheduled a meeting between President Barack Obama and the 64-year-old cleric.
Two years ago, the Iranian mission to the U.N. canceled a similar dinner with Ahmadinejad when too few wanted to come.
He has proclaimed the "age of blood feuds" over, and said the United States and Iran can "turn threats into opportunities."
His soft-spoken successor, Hassan Rouhani, is likely to give a conciliatory address to world leaders this week.

But U.S. officials have hinted that Obama and other top officials are ready to chat with Rouhani or his U.S.-educated foreign minister.
The question remains: Is Rouhani simply presenting a more moderate face to the world?
That would undermine his negotiating leverage and make influential members of Congress upset.
But U.S. officials have hinted that Obama and other top officials are ready to chat with Rouhani or his U.S.-educated foreign minister.
Hassan Rouhani was elected in June and is a lot more moderate than the previous president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
People will be listening for signs that he is willing to get along better with the United States and other western countries.
Western diplomats think Rouhani will say something important.
The White House says President Barack Obama and Rouhani are not scheduled to meet.
But U.S. officials have hinted that Obama and other top officials are ready to chat with Rouhani.

He and his colleagues named the fossil after the Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds," which played repeatedly the night he made the discovery.
She showed us it happened in Eastern Africa, and more specifically in the Afar region of Ethiopia where she was found.
So what has changed is that we understand it was not a straight line from the most ancestral species to modern humans, that there were many false starts.
The features that distinguish us from all other animals are symbolic language, our cooperation, and a culture that allows us to make cumulative developments that no single individual could make alone.
There are thousands of fossils in vaults throughout the world that have only been superficially studied.
We also have geological deposits throughout Africa that have not been thoroughly examined and I think new discoveries will be made and be surprising.

Scientists found that the same virus that is killing sea stars today is also present in museum sea star specimens dating back to 1942, indicating the disease has been present in Pacific waters for 72 years.
Within days, they curl up and parts of their arms break off, sometimes literally crawling away.
It could be something natural, like overpopulation of sea stars in some areas.
But big questions remain.
What started it all off?
"There are 10 million viruses in a drop of seawater, so discovering the virus associated with a marine disease can be like looking for a needle in a haystack," said Cornell microbiologist Ian Hewson, lead author of the study.
Those are really important questions.
Millions of sea stars, also known as starfish, have died in the last year along California and the Pacific Coast.
It has infected at least 20 different species of starfish since it was first detected in Washington state in June 2013.
Wasting syndrome has even killed starfish in major aquariums in Seattle, Monterey and other cities.
Within days, they curl up and parts of their arms break off, actually crawling away.
They reported that the disease is a type of densovirus, similar to viruses that affect insects, sea urchins and other invertebrates \u2014 animals without a backbone.
But it does not affect humans and there is no way to offer a cure to starfish populations.
"There are 10 million viruses in a drop of seawater, so discovering the virus associated with a marine disease can be like looking for a needle in a haystack," said Cornell University microbiologist Ian Hewson, lead author of the study.
Working with 335 starfish collected on the West Coast, the Cornell researchers exposed healthy starfish to tissue from infected ones, learning how the disease spread.
Sea stars in Big Sur and other areas appear to have had lot of offspring over the past year, scientists say.

Just over a year ago, Hamlet Garcia climbed up the steps of a courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, wondering if he would be sent to jail.
The resident of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and his wife, Olesia, an insurance agent, were about to go on trial for theft of services, an offense usually reserved for cable service pilferers and restaurant bill dodgers.
"I\'m hearing about it more and more every year," said Gloria Romero, a former California state senator and founder of the California Center for Parent Empowerment.
And while perhaps extreme, they are worrying civil rights activists, parent advocacy groups and some local politicians.
They say strict enforcement strategies unfairly impact poor families of color.
In the case of the Garcias, the father says that during the 2011-2012 school year, he and his wife had problems in their marriage and temporarily separated.
They "essentially stole from every hard-working taxpayer" who lives in the school district, said prosecutor Risa Vetri Ferman.
In Michigan, parents convicted of providing false documents to satisfy student residency requirements can be jailed for up to 20 days.
In Washington, D.C., they can get up to 90 days for providing false documentation, and in Oklahoma, the jail sentence can be up to a year.
"It\'s a \'gotcha\' thing," said Gwen Samuel, the founder of the Connecticut Parents Union, which has helped to support a handful of families that have been criminally charged for enrollment fraud.
Around the country, parent groups are fighting back: by publicizing the cases and lobbying against jail time.
The groups argue that school residency laws are unconstitutional because they discriminate against parents in struggling school districts.

Noah Madson remembers being exhausted after hours of tests for ADHD, a disorder that makes concentration difficult.
The game, called "Groundskeeper," asks the user to use one cube \u2014 the mallet \u2014 to hit a gopher that pops up on the screens of the other three cubes.
The cubes produce data on more than 70 different variables, including errors, response times and even whether the player is fidgeting.
But, Heller said, one thing is clear: Caretakers for children with ADHD could use extra help.
We\'re doing the best we can to make sure we\'re not selling something that gets people\'s hopes up and doesn\'t work."
Nancy Madson said she\'s thrilled about the game, which Heller said was designed to be "just boring enough" so that it does not overwhelm the brain with too much excitement.
Noah Madson remembers being exhausted after hours of tests for ADHD, a disorder that makes concentration difficult.

"But her story tells kids that if you love something, if you really want something, you can have an impact on the world.

Much of what we know about how chimpanzees behave is thanks to one person: Jane Goodall.
A new children\'s book, "Untamed: The Wild Life of Jane Goodall," is filled with amazing photos and stories of Jane\'s life and her important scientific discoveries.
"Untamed" begins with Goodall\'s childhood in London, England.
She loved being in nature and reading books like "The Story of Doctor Dolittle," which is a fictional story about a veterinarian who travels to parts of Africa and learns to speak to animals.
Is there something I can learn here that is actually a way for my life to go?"
When she was in her early 20s, Goodall received an invitation from a school friend to visit Africa.
Silvey writes that Goodall "focused on chimpanzees as individuals, with distinct personalities."
At the time, the larger scientific community recorded animals with numbers.
Silvey\'s book contains many wonderful images, including four pages of a chimpanzee "family scrapbook."
"But her story lets kids know that if you love something, if you really want something, you can change the world."
Once she was in Africa, Goodall quickly got herself a job with Louis Leakey.

SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. announced Monday that it will end orca shows at its San Diego park after visitors at the tourist attraction made it clear they prefer seeing killer whales act naturally rather than doing tricks.
It chronicles the case of Tilikum, a killer whale that caused the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010 by pulling her into a pool at SeaWorld Orlando.
Attendance has dropped the most at the San Diego location, and the decision to end orca shows will be limited for now to that park, the original home of Shamu, its first orca.
The shows will continue at the other two SeaWorld parks in Orlando and San Antonio, Texas.
Manby told investors Monday that California customers want to see a less theatrical production, so the new attraction will have a strong conservation message.
"We certainly know with the regulatory environment out there that happened with orcas, and some of what happened in California, with the reputation out there, I think we would be foolish if we didn\'t look at other options," Manby said.
Policy pop quiz: Does Texas - algebra II = success?
"It\'s funny that the banner-turning state would be backing off not so many years later," said Jennifer Dounay Zinth, a policy analyst at Education Commission of the States.
Coalition spokesman Mike Meroney said that with fewer state-mandated courses, school districts can better work with local employers to build curriculums that prepare high school graduates to move directly into high-paying jobs.
The new changes still require algebra II for honors diplomas, which can ensure automatic admission to Texas public universities, or for diploma plans focusing on science, technology, engineering and math courses, or STEM.
Vocal critics include powerful lobbying group Texas Association of Business, which accused Texas of dumbing-down curriculum.
"That would have been a dream come true, if I had stopped after geometry," said Hutt, an 11th grader at Alamo Heights High School in San Antonio.
Witte said the course is beneficial, but he and Texas lawmakers argued the vigorous math course was pushing some students to drop out.
"There\'s a fear that if we set higher standards for all students, more students will drop out," Dounay Zinth said.
Policy pop quiz: Does Texas - algebra II = success?
Stephen Waddell, superintendent in the Dallas suburb of Lewisville, said mandating algebra II was unnecessary because most high schoolers take it anyway.
But the Texas Education Agency reported last summer that an all-time high \u2014 nearly 88 percent of students from the Class of 2012 \u2014 graduated on time.
Policy pop quiz: Does Texas - algebra II = success?
It was the fifth consecutive year of improvement.
"Algebra II is a really, really powerful predictive value on whether kids go to college, but it goes on and on after that," said Patte Barth, director of the Center for Public Education.
He warned that taking away requirements for advanced math and science would leave students badly prepared for college and technical careers.
He said his company offers well-paying jobs for people with two-year degrees or high school career training.
They found no correlation between graduation rates and higher standards, said Dounay Zinth, the education policy analyst.
Eight years ago, Texas started a trend by making high school students tackle algebra II.

"Each person infected with an animal influenza virus is judged a threat to public health, because the influenza pandemics of the past 100 years have all emerged from animals," Marion Koopmans, a virologist at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in Bilthoven, Netherlands, wrote in a commentary that accompanies the study.
20-year-old woman in Taiwan has achieved the dubious distinction of being the first patient known to have been sickened by a strain of bird flu known as H6N1.
And: Does this make humans more vulnerable to a bird flu pandemic?
They used a genetic test called real-time RT-PCR and got a match for H6N1 influenza.
Versions of the H6N1 that sickened the woman have been infecting chickens in Taiwan since 1997, according to the report.

20-year-old woman in Taiwan has achieved the dubious distinction of being the first patient known to have been sickened by a strain of bird flu known as H6N1.
But her case raises important questions that investigators are still trying to answer, including: How did she contract the flu?
She was discharged from the hospital two days later.

20-year-old woman in Taiwan has achieved the dubious distinction of being the first patient known to have been sickened by a strain of bird flu known as H6N1.
It is still not clear how the virus was able to jump from chickens to the 20-year-old woman.
20-year-old woman in Taiwan has the unfortunate distinction of being the first patient known to come down with a strain of bird flu called H6N1.
However, a particular strain called H5N1 typically kills more than half of the people who are infected with it.
And: Does this make humans more likely to be affected by a bird flu pandemic, that could spread through humans the world over?
Seasonal flus,  the kind you can protect against with a flu shot, are of the H1, H2 or H3 varieties.

20-year-old woman in Taiwan has become the first patient known to get sick with a rare strain of bird flu.
Bird flu is a type of influenza that jumps from birds to humans.
The woman, who became ill in May, appears to have gotten completely better, according to a report published this week by the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine.
But tests of her throat failed to turn up signs of known influenza strains.
Versions of the H6N1 that sickened the woman have been infecting chickens in Taiwan since 1997.
Six of these people became ill with fevers or respiratory infections.
A doctor who treated her and several other patients with respiratory infections was one of those who got sick.

20-year-old woman in Taiwan has become the first patient to have a certain type of bird flu.
But tests failed to turn up signs of known types of flu.
Viruses are infections that attack the cells in the body.
The test showed that the genes were like a strain of flu found in Taiwanese chickens.
None of them showed signs of the flu.
The big question now is if this flu could get bigger and spread to more people.
Of all the things she was forced to leave behind in Syria, her education was the one thing she could not afford to lose \u2013 not if she were ever going to realize her dream of being a doctor and avoid a future dictated by deprivation, violence and loss.
Education not only increases the chances that, someday, children will be able to support themselves and seek a better life for their families; it also provides them with the skills to rebuild their societies.
And it can instill in them a desire to seek reconciliation when the conflicts have been resolved and the catastrophes have ended.
In the 35 countries most affected by violence, 65 million children from ages 3 to 15 are at risk of missing out on learning.
And according to new data released by the Education for All Global Monitoring Report, young women living in conflict-affected areas are nearly 90 percent more likely to be out of secondary school than their counterparts in more stable countries.
This is all the more problematic, given that even a single year of additional schooling for girls increases both their earning power and the likelihood that they will send their own children to school.
Though the number of children affected by crisis is reaching an all-time high, financing for education in emergencies remains outrageously low.
That begins with acceptance of a basic truth: that learning is not only a critical element of relief for every child in an emergency, but also a crucial investment in the future development of their societies.
For we face a choice, one that we must make collectively: Should we spend more now on education in emergencies, or pay the price of a lost generation of poorly educated children who will someday be inadequately equipped to rebuild their shattered societies?
We humans use our hands, sharks and wolves use their jaws, but a few animals like frogs use something much stranger: their tongues.
Then they offered up tantalizing grasshoppers behind the glass.
One enthusiastic juvenile managed to slam his tongue into the plate with 3.4 times the force of his own weight.
In contrast to structural adhesives like glue \u2014 which harden to form a permanent bond \u2014 pressure-sensitive adhesives employ a substance somewhere between a solid and liquid.
The tongue prints they left behind gave scientists an indication of the contact area and the amount of mucus on the tongue.
One enthusiastic juvenile managed to slam his tongue into the plate with 3.4 times the force of his own weight.
It must be fluid enough to form a connection between the surfaces it binds but elastic enough to resist being ripped apart.
It may not happen any time soon, but someday we might look back and see how frog tongues helped us lick the problem of sticky tape.
When the hungry frogs fired their "ballistic tongues" (yes, that\'s an actual scientific term), the sensors measured the impact force.
Every predator needs to catch its prey.
For the experiment, the researchers used the horned frog, a round South American amphibian with devilish protrusions above its eye sockets.
One enthusiastic young frog managed to slam his tongue into the plate with 3.4 times the force of his own weight.
She is an amphibian biologist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff who was not involved in the study.
Kleinteich thinks how it works most closely resembles pressure-sensitive adhesion.
Then they offered up delicious grasshoppers behind the glass.
He is the lead author of the study and a zoologist at Kiel University in Germany.
This ability to reel in large prey would be a particular help to a sit-and-wait species like the horned frog, said Kiisa Nishikawa.
That is the same effect that allows sticky tape and labels to cling to a surface and later be removed without a trace.
Frogs are predators, and every predator needs to catch its prey.
They use a sticking substance similar to the tacky glue on Post-it notes.
For the experiment, the researchers used the horned frog, a round South American amphibian with evil-looking "horns" above its eye sockets.
The tongue prints they left behind gave scientists an idea of the size of the contact area and the amount of mucus on the tongue.
However, the results present another possible reason for fast-flicking frogs.
Structural adhesives like glue harden to form a permanent bond.
It must be fluid enough to form a connection between the surfaces it binds, but elastic enough to resist being ripped apart.
Every animal has to eat and each has a different way of catching its prey.
They found that certain frogs can lift meals up to three times heavier than their body weight.
Then they catch their victims with powerful tongues.
Then they placed delicious grasshoppers behind the glass.
One meal could be all they need to eat for the whole year, Nishikawa said.
What they did next upended everything parents, teachers and students thought they knew about grading.
Instead, grades are more heavily based on exam results and the quality of work.
Critics say the approach may sound good as a concept.
But what that means in the classroom or at home is another matter, they say.
Under standards-based grading, students face no penalty \u2014 pointwise \u2014 for failing to turn in homework.
And when new grading policies were explained to middle school parents this year, jaws dropped.
"The general mood of the room was, \'This isn\'t how I had it growing up.\'
"The learning is what\'s important, it\'s not just the \'check off\' of getting the grade in the grade book," said Karen Hargadine, executive director of pre-K and elementary education for the Rockwood School District, which has been phasing in the standards-based model.
A few schools are even trying having students stay in during recess until missing homework is complete.
"Parents trust that schools are preparing their children for life after high school," Melissa Schumacher wrote.
We\'re seeing a change and it\'s pretty powerful."
But what that means in the classroom or at home is another matter, they say.
"That\'s not real life," he said.
Since the change, Lincoln has moved from the bottom of the district in its performance on state tests to the top.
Parents at Lincoln Elementary School in St. Charles, Mo., thought their children were a shining example of academic achievement.
"There are kids that are good at playing the game of school," said Julie Williams, principal of Lincoln Elementary.
But what that means in the classroom is another matter, they say.
"We\'re seeing a change and it\'s pretty powerful."
The usual way of grading can cover up failure.
A student might earn a D grade in math.

The drone, a powerful but controversial weapon against terrorism, is about to take on a new and seemingly inexhaustible enemy: the black salt marsh mosquito.
Whether or not the drone proves an effective mosquito hunter, the test shows how unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs are quickly changing.
"I would have laughed two years ago if you would have told me this could help with mosquito control," said Derek Lyons, vice president of sales for Prioria Robotics, a company, founded by University of Florida engineering and business students, that builds the Maveric drone being tested in the Keys.
The battery-powered drone weighs 2.6 pounds and has a wing span of just over 2\xbd feet.
It can easily be launched by hand like a paper airplane or, thanks to wings made of flexible metal fabric, shot from a 6-inch-diameter carrying tube.
The drone can fly for up to 70 minutes in a six-mile radius, cruising at about 30 miles per hour, with its rotating camera streaming live video to a laptop.
Doyle estimated the tactic eliminates about 80 percent of marsh mosquitoes.

The drone, a powerful but controversial weapon against terrorism, is about to take on a new and seemingly inexhaustible enemy: the black salt marsh mosquito.
On Sept. 2, the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District began testing the next-generation drone.
The new [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) is about half the size of ospreys, the large sea hawks commonly seen in the Keys.
Instead, it will be rigged with an infrared thermal camera that detects temperature variations.
If the bird-size eye in the sky can accurately detect such pools, it could save mosquito-fighters time, effort and money.
"Our people on the ground have to walk an hour to a marsh and find out what\'s there,\'\' said Michael Doyle, the district\'s executive director.
Whether the drone proves an effective mosquito hunter or not, the test shows how unmanned aerial vehicles are quickly changing.
In coming years, researchers at the University of Florida hope to be able to use drones for a variety of new purposes.

22-foot beaked whale that apparently took a wrong turn up an African river about 17 million years ago may offer clues to the climate-change forces that shaped human evolution.
Lost for more than 30 years, the fossilized beak and jaw bone help determine that the East African Plateau probably began rising no earlier than 17 million years ago, according to a study published online Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
He had read about the 1964 find, by James G. Mead of the Smithsonian Institution, in a 1975 research paper.
Finally, just before another trip to Kenya in 2011, a collections official at Harvard located the fossil, sheathed in the protective jacket, Jacobs said.
Even the Antarctic minke that took the longest known detour, more than 600 miles up the Amazon and its tributary, the Tapajos, reached an elevation of little more than 3 feet above the Atlantic Ocean.
The whale bone was found in a thick layer of sediment beneath a lava flow dated to 17 million years old, according to the study.
Fossil and geologic evidence correlate that uplift with a long-term drying of the local climate, which changed a humid forest into grasslands with more widely spaced trees.
Scientists theorize that this kind of environmental pressure favored primates that could straighten their backs and walk longer distances on two feet, leading to the radiation into species that led to modern humans.
22-foot beaked whale that apparently took a wrong turn up an African river about 17 million years ago may offer clues to the climate-change forces that shaped human evolution.
A humpback whale, dubbed Humphrey, twice swam a more modest 82 miles up the Sacramento River in California.
Based on the sea level and shape of the African coast at the time, the whale would have traveled 372 to 559 miles from the Indian Ocean, bringing it to an elevation of 78 to 121 feet, according to the study.

A federal appeals court became the first in the nation to rule that prospective jurors may not be excluded because of their sexual orientation, a decision that expands juror protections beyond race and gender and provides legal ammunition to challenge laws that limit gay rights.
The sweeping, unanimous decision Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a mixed jury verdict in an antitrust case involving an AIDS drug.
When a law discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, it must be closely evaluated to "ensure that our most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or second-class status," Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for the court.
The panel said excluding gay jurors violated their constitutional right to equal protection under the law.
Gay rights activists applauded the ruling and predicted that it would help them win marriage rights in other Western states besides California, where same-sex marriage was reinstated last summer.
After a four-week trial, the jury largely decided in favor of Abbott but awarded GlaxoSmithKline $3.5 million in damages on a contract claim.
"Jury service is one of the most important responsibilities of an American citizen," Reinhardt wrote, agreeing with GlaxoSmithKline.
"It gives gay and lesbian individuals a means of articulating their values and a voice in resolving controversies that affect their lives as well as the lives of all others."
Lawyers can often get around the antidiscrimination requirement by providing a neutral reason for a juror\'s removal, but "if the real reason is bias, they have to be quick on their feet to come up with another reason, and it has to be consistent with how they treated other jurors," Davidson said.
Adelle M. Infante, a representative for Abbott, said: "We are reviewing the opinion and evaluating our options."

Gay people cannot be excluded from serving as jurors on a trial just because of their sexual orientation, according to a federal appeals court Tuesday.
The unanimous decision Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S.
The decision will also make it harder to justify laws that treat gays and lesbians differently from other people.
This includes bans on same-sex marriage, lawyers said.
Gays are fighting laws in Nevada, Oregon, Idaho and Arizona that prohibit men from marrying men and women from marrying women.
"This is really a very big deal," said Jon W. Davidson, the legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group.
He said the decision would make it "exceedingly difficult" for states to justify discriminating against gays.
The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by drug company SmithKline Beecham Corp., now GlaxoSmithKline, against Abbott Laboratories, another drug company.
AIDS, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, is a deadly disease transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, including sexual contact.
Before a jury trial begins, the lawyers for both sides pick the men and women of the jury.
On appeal, Abbott provided several neutral reasons for excluding the man.
"But I do say that in the 80 or 90 percent of the encounters that they have as police officers, which usually have nothing to do with a crime being committed, they can treat the folk that they\'re facing and dealing with and incidents with that kind of character and spirit."

It was given an "F" for the indicators it met on the latest state report card, which measures what percent of students passed achievement and graduation tests.
As soon as we get on whatever the next hot social media site is and start monitoring kids on Facebook.
Students also choose the school because they are struggling in certain subjects, because their families rely on them to work, because they have children of their own or because they want to challenge themselves, Stewart said.
"You just really underestimate, even though she\'s beautiful \u2026 it\'s amazing what peers can do when they\'re telling you the opposite."
Krista Hooten saw "terror" in her daughter\'s eyes as they started back-to-school shopping for seventh grade.
One-third of all children \u2014 an estimated 13 million students nationwide \u2014 are targeted each year, according to the White House.
The online school was created in 2006, and has grown as an option for bullied students even as cyberbullying has become more prominent.
"It changed her personality," Hooten said.
Now 16 and in 10th grade, Kelsey said she has been able to escape bullying since she started attending the Ohio Virtual Academy.
Hannah, 11, enrolled because she was missing many days of traditional school due to her asthma.

Krista Hooten knew something had to be done when she saw "terror" in her daughter\'s eyes as they started back-to-school shopping for seventh grade.
It started with emotional abuse, such as other girls calling her ugly and spreading rumors about her.
After Hooten returned from the shopping trip, she and her husband decided it was time to make a change.
About 94 percent of those parents said going online helped address the problem.
One-third of all U.S. children \u2014 an estimated 13 million students nationwide \u2014 are targeted each year, according to the White House.
Krista Hooten said her daughter did not talk about the extent to which she was bullied during sixth grade, and even when the attacks became physical, the teenager would "act like she was dealing with it and it wasn\'t that big a deal."
She said, "All I knew at that point was she didn\'t want to go, to the point where (when) she would leave in the morning, she cried all the way to the bus stop."
Only about 42 percent of its students graduate in four years, according to its latest report card.
Students are given home computers, printers and a microscope and watch live videos and do chats with licensed teachers.
"Because of cyberbullying, students can\'t escape it," said Susan Davies, who trains school psychologists to recognize and deal with bullying.
The school has expelled and suspended students in the past, though not often.
Lexie, 14, started to give herself more time for her 20-hour-a-week dance commitment, while Hannah, 11, enrolled because she was missing many days of traditional school due to her asthma.

Finding a civil rights cause that increasingly brings together conservatives and liberals, the Supreme Court told employers Monday that they had an "affirmative" duty under federal anti-discrimination law to accommodate the religious practices of employees and job applicants.
He said the Civil Rights Act of 1964 puts the legal burden on employers not to discriminate.
In January, the justices ruled unanimously for a Muslim inmate in Arkansas who sought the right to maintain a short beard despite the prison\'s "no beards" policy.
Finding a civil rights cause that increasingly brings together conservatives and liberals, the Supreme Court told employers Monday that they had an "affirmative" duty under federal anti-discrimination law to accommodate the religious practices of employees and job applicants.
It says employers may not "refuse to hire" or otherwise discriminate against someone because of their "race, color, religion, sex or national origin."
Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver reversed the decision and said the company was not liable because she did not ask for a special accommodation for her religion.

It says employers may not "refuse to hire" or otherwise discriminate against someone because of their "race, color, religion, sex or national origin."
On Monday, the Supreme Court told employers that they cannot discriminate on the basis of religion.
She said the retailer allowed workers to wear headscarves when requested for religious reasons.
Last year, a French appeals court upheld the dismissal of a Muslim day care employee for refusing to remove her headscarf at work.
On Monday, the Supreme Court told employers that they cannot discriminate on the basis of religion.
The store\'s managers must have known or "at least suspected" that Elauf wore the headscarf for religious reasons, he said.
Experts in workplace discrimination said the decision could have a major effect.
The law says employers may not "refuse to hire" or otherwise discriminate against someone because of their "race, color, religion, sex or national origin."
Wanting a particular person to follow that policy does not amount to "intentional discrimination," he argued.
On Monday, Justice Clarence Thomas was the only judge to vote in favor of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.
Workers cannot be treated unfairly and unequally because of their religion, the court declared.
Unequal and unfair treatment is known as discrimination.
Many religions haves rules about how people should dress.
Sometimes the two sets of rules do not match up.
Many Muslim women wear such scarves every day for religious reasons.
It said it did not discriminate against her because of her religion, since it did not know she was Muslim.
Justice Antonin Scalia said it was simply not believable.
The store must have known or "at least suspected" that Elauf wore the headscarf for religious reasons, he said.
From now on, workers and job seekers will not have to ask for a "religious accommodation," said lawyer Michael Droke.
It will be up to companies to make accommodations whether they are asked or not.
Research has shown that primates can produce unique calls for things or events in their environment.
In contrast, human speech is flexible and can be taught.
Other research has shown that primates and non-primates change their calls as circumstances change.
"But it could also be more likely that it\'s some aspect of a social bonding function.
If you sound more like the one you\'re with, then you just have a better chance of making friends and having a place in the social group."
The researchers lean toward the latter explanation and think the chimpanzees were driven by the need to get along.
He said that if he learned that "gato" means "cat" in Spanish, then he has learned a new word for cat.
The discovery suggests something else important about language.
A key element of communication may have been present 7 million to 13 million years ago in the last common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans.
But the process of getting to know one another was slow too.
The building blocks of language may go back far longer than humans have walked the earth, a new study has found.
In 2010, a band of chimpanzees was transferred from the Netherlands to a zoo in Scotland.
At first, the two groups of chimps used different grunts to refer to apples.
Three years later, after the two groups had bonded, they had developed a common sound for the fruit.
Before the study, scientists had thought that learning language from each other was something only humans could do.
By 2013, it became clear that the grunts the Dutch chimps made for apples had come down in pitch.
However, this would be the first time anyone has shown that an animal learned a call from another animal.
Snowdon pointed out that the two chimp groups took a long time to warm up.
In 2010, a band of chimpanzees was transferred from the Netherlands to a zoo in Scotland.

In that sense, some people might pay less attention to and filter out the blue background light, which makes the person see the dress as gold and white, he said.
Kiel Conjack of Freeport, Pennsylvania, thought his wife was pranking him when she said she saw blue and black.
He took up the blue and black banner, and it "felt good" to be eventually proven right, he said.
Science to the rescue.
If the person filters out the white or yellow light, he or she will see blue and black.
Controversy rages even if science can explain it.
Debates broke out in workplaces across the globe, and websites declared that the Internet was freaking out and losing its mind over the question.
Kiel Conjack thought his wife was pranking him when she said she saw blue and black and they got into an argument over the dress color.
Matthew A. Smith, a professor of ophthalmology and neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh, said people think their eyes simply take a photo and post it in the brain, but that is not the case in reality.
When the brain does not have enough information, it interprets the image and makes guesses.
John J. Guehl III, chief of ophthalmology at West Penn Hospital, described it as a kind of optical illusion.
If the brain ignores the white or yellow light, he or she will see a blue and black dress.
Everyone in Pittsburgh sees the dress as black and gold, the colors of the Steelers and other local sports teams, he joked.
The now-famous dress had people debating all over the Internet: Is it blue and black, or gold and white?
Scientists have explained why a photo of a dress posted online looked like different colors to different people.
They got into an argument until his wife turned to the Internet and found a photo that proved the true color of the dress.

A mother can ignore a roomful of noise, but will hear her own baby, Guehl said.
That all came to an end in 2009, he said, when the military abruptly opened fire at a protest he was covering, massacring dozens.
They often live in poverty, though as a group they are more likely than any other immigrant group to hold at least a university degree, according to the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), a think-tank based in Washington, D.C.

"I will be rearranging my schedule as necessary so I can undergo treatment by physicians at Emory Healthcare," Carter said in the statement released by the Carter Center in Atlanta.
Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said "there\'s a lot we don\'t know," but the first task likely will be determining where the cancer originated, which can help determine what treatment Carter may be eligible for.
The first task is to determine whether the cancer is curable, "which is unlikely with metastatic cancer," or if it is possible to meaningfully prolong the life through surgery or other treatments, Balducci said.
"Cancer in a 90-year-old is a serious problem, but that does not mean a 90-year-old cannot benefit from treatment."
In May, he was forced to cut short an election observation visit to Guyana when he developed a bad cold.
Carter also completed a book tour this summer to promote his latest work, "A Full Life," which includes his family\'s history of pancreatic cancer.
He wrote in the memoir that his father, brother and two sisters all died of the disease and said the trend "concerned" the former president\'s doctors at Emory.
A Georgia peanut farmer who had been a state senator and governor of Georgia for a single term before running for president, Carter defeated Gerald Ford in 1976 with a pledge to always be honest.
He spent the decades since carving out a reputation for promoting such global issues as health care and democracy, often with his wife Rosalynn by his side.
Carter wrote that being the only nonsmoker in his family "may have been what led to my longer life."

macaque monkey who took now-famous selfie photographs should be declared the copyright owner of the photos, rather than the nature photographer who positioned the camera, animal-rights activists contend in a novel lawsuit filed last Tuesday.
Copyright Office issued an updated compendium of its policies, including a section stipulating that it would register copyrights only for works produced by human beings.
However, Jeffrey Kerr, a lawyer with PETA, said the copyright office\'s policy "is only an opinion," and the U.S.
Citing Slater\'s own written accounts of his encounter with the macaques, the lawsuit asserts that Naruto "authored the monkey selfies by his own independent, autonomous actions in examining and manipulating Slater\'s unattended camera."
Slater has been openly dismayed by the prolonged dispute over the photos and says the British copyright obtained for the photos by his company, Wildlife Personalities Ltd., should be honored worldwide.
Last year, as the dispute simmered, Slater offered copies of a "monkey selfie" photo to purchasers willing to pay only for shipping and handling, and said he would donate $1.70 per order to a conservation project dedicated to protecting Sulawesi\'s macaques.
Laurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor who supports animal rights, expressed misgivings about the litigation.

Though they have "rat" in their name, the Allegheny woodrats are nothing like the common rats that skitter across subway rails and leap out of urban dumpsters.
Once common from New England to Alabama, the woodrat has disappeared from Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York, has significantly declined in Pennsylvania, and is nearly gone from Ohio and Indiana.
"Because of roads and development, there no longer is any way for this group to have genetic exchange, and so inbreeding causes the colony\'s genetic variability to decline," said Mick Valent, principal zoologist with the state Department of Environmental Protection.
He is on a mission to help save the woodrats of the Palisades by trying to keep the colony healthy and possibly importing woodrats from other regions.
They also collect dried raccoon droppings, which contain undigested seeds and berries that the woodrat can feed on.
Twice a year, in spring and fall, Valent travels by boat along the Hudson and lands at the hard-to-access areas at the base of the Palisades where woodrats live.
There, he sets out bait for raccoons, laced with dewormer.
The idea of transferring woodrats from one state to another is not unprecedented.

In a remote part of Argentina scientists have unearthed a remarkably complete skeleton of a new species of dinosaur called Dreadnoughtus schrani.
It measured 85 feet from head to tail, including its 37-foot-long neck and 30-foot-long muscular tail.
Nothing could have attacked Dreadnoughtus and won, scientists say, because it was simply too big.
The specimen found in Patagonia died sometime between 66 million and 84 million years ago.
Lacovara first stumbled on the crumbled remains of the Dreadnoughtus during a fossil-hunting trip in February 2005.
"I found a little cluster of broken-up bones and recorded it in my GPS," said Lacovara.
They lived in the Southern Hemisphere during the final 30 million years of the age of the dinosaurs, which ended some 66 million years ago.

"It boggles the mind that they did not act in a way that ... sent a message that this is more serious," said Kluger, who helped oversee New York putting in courts that deal specifically with domestic violence.
"The stronger voice of the NFL about this that we have no tolerance for violence against women, no tolerance of coercion, no tolerance of objectifying women, that to me would be a real pivotal moment for professional sports where they say enough is enough," Wynn said.
"The first time with marijuana is different from the first time you are knocking your wife unconscious," said Judy Harris Kluger, executive director of Sanctuary for Families and a former judge in New York City.
He has not divulged what happened in the elevator except to call his actions "totally inexcusable."
So the NFL gave him the only punishment he likely faces in a suspension and a fine that totals more than $500,000.
Me having to explain that to her, what happened that night, that\'s something I have to live with the rest of my life," Rice said at training camp.
The NFL has yet to punish Carolina Pro Bowl defensive end Greg Hardy, who is awaiting a jury trial on his conviction for attacking his ex-girlfriend in his apartment in May.
This is not a new issue for the NFL.
"What they did was such a small sort of slap on the wrist.

Domestic violence is covered under separate personal conduct rules, and it has been left up to the commissioner to deal with individual cases as he sees fit.
Ravens running back Ray Rice is sitting out just two games for committing domestic violence: allegedly beating his fiancee until she was unconscious.
Domestic violence \u2014 violence directed against wives or girlfriends \u2014 is a serious problem in professional sports.
"The first time with marijuana is different from the first time you are knocking your wife unconscious," said anti\u2013domestic violence activist Judy Harris Kluger.
Rice is believed to have beaten the woman \u2014 to whom he was then engaged \u2014 so badly that she passed out.
The NFL has yet to punish Carolina Pro Bowl defensive end Greg Hardy, who is awaiting trial for attacking his ex-girlfriend.
According to domestic violence expert Mark Wynn, what the NFL does next is being watched closely.
If the NFL were to say strongly, "we have no tolerance for violence against women," he said, it would be a historically important moment for professional sports.
President Barack Obama canceled his trip to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow next month, , the White House said Wednesday.
That means he will not be sent back to the U.S. to face the charges.
Obama will attend the Group of 20 economic summit in St. Petersburg.

Police have arrested more than 30 suspects in connection with a massive diamond heist that happened in February at the Brussels International Airport in Brussels, Belgium.
By the time backup security was called, the robbers had vanished.
When captured, police also found many uncut diamonds and more than $100,000 cash.
During a civil war that stretched from 1991 until 2002 in the African country of Sierra Leone, illegal diamond mining was at some of its highest levels.
Today, while several countries are participants in the Kimberley Process (including the United States and many European countries), some still worry that diamonds bought and sold are coming from unclean sources or that the miners are not being fairly compensated.
One of the largest heists happened in February 2005 at the Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, Netherlands, when two men disguised in airline uniforms drove a stolen truck onto the tarmac and grabbed an estimated $118 million worth of diamonds from another truck nearby.
In February 2003, a group of men at the Antwerp World Diamond Centre in Antwerp, Belgium, posed as diamond merchants and made their way into a vault.
Police unwisely did not pay attention to her comments and just a few days later, it was found that jewel thieves had drilled a tunnel underneath a jewelry store.
One morning, they popped up from their hole, tied up the jewelry store staff, and made off with $20 million in jewelry.

RLIN \u2013 Over the last 15 years, the bottled-water industry has experienced explosive growth, which shows no sign of slowing.
In fact, bottled water \u2013 including everything from "purified spring water" to flavored water and water enriched with vitamins, minerals, or electrolytes \u2013 is the largest growth area in the beverage industry, even in cities where tap water is safe and highly regulated.
The bulk of bottled water sold worldwide is drawn from the subterranean water reserves of aquifers and springs, many of which feed rivers and lakes.
But bottling the runoff from glaciers in the Alps, the Andes, the Arctic, the Cascades, the Himalayas, Patagonia, the Rockies, and elsewhere is not much better, as it diverts that water from ecosystem services like recharging wetlands and sustaining biodiversity.
This has not stopped big bottlers and other investors from aggressively seeking to buy glacier-water rights.
In the 1990s, it was PET that turned water into a portable, lightweight convenience product.
But PET does not decompose; and, while it can be recycled, it usually is not.
In the United States, where the volume of bottled water sold last year increased 7 percent from 2013, 80 percent of all plastic water bottles become litter, choking landfills.
And it does not even taste better; indeed, blind taste tests reveal that people cannot tell the difference between bottled and tap water.
When a product that is cheaper and better does not prevail, that is bad news for consumers.

She was such a strong politician that she became known as the "Iron Lady," a nickname she greatly enjoyed.
A gifted student, Thatcher went to the prestigious Oxford University, where she became more and more interested in politics.
She quickly rose through the ranks to become a member of Parliament, the British equivalent of being in Congress, in 1959.
Thatcher believed in a small state, meaning that the government should have limited power over the lives of its citizens.
When Thatcher was in charge of education, she cut the free milk supply for all children above age 7.
In order to increase economic competition, Thatcher took harsh measures against what she considered to be underperforming industries, like coal mining, but encouraged the growth of industries perceived to be more profitable, like banking.
Industries in Britain, like in most other countries, are geographically concentrated in certain regions.
But her policies also resulted in the widespread closure of large numbers of coal mines, factories and shipyards, which were mostly located in northern England, Scotland and Wales.
The territory of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean is still subject to dispute between Britain and Argentina.
In 1982, Argentina invaded the islands and Thatcher responded decisively with British military force.
By collaborating, Reagan, Thatcher and Gorbachev helped end the Cold War peacefully.

In Paslang, a hilltop farming village 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu where most homes were damaged or destroyed, residents said the quake killed two buffalo and a goat when the tin roofs of their sheds collapsed.
AWNN, an umbrella group, is coordinating with outside organizations such as Humane Society International to bring in veterinarians and food supplies and get the necessary vaccines and medicines for sick and injured animals.
Contaminated water supplies and loss of barns, and the stress of the disaster, can put cows, goats and other farm animals at risk for respiratory ailments, hoof disease and other problems.
"You can spend a day getting to just three or four villages, and there are thousands of villages\u2014it\'s not like other places where we\'ve recently had earthquakes, like Haiti," he said.
"If people are homeless and can\'t care for their animals, we need to help them with food, veterinary care and vaccinations," he said.
The aim is to care for pets for a few months and reunite as many as possible with their owners once their living situation stabilizes.
Three dogs with broken legs have been waiting days for surgery at the Vet For Your Pet clinic in this city just east of Kathmandu.
Elsewhere, many pets and livestock that survived the earthquake are homeless.
The animal aid organization Animal Welfare Network Nepal (AWNN) is trying to address the problem.
Usually, farmers own two large animals, such as cows, along with around 10 small animals, such as goats.

Years earlier, Clifford photographed what he now believes to have been a 15th-century wrought-iron lombard or cannon that has since disappeared.
"There are only seven lombards that have been found in the Western world," Clifford told the Miami Herald on Tuesday.
The Santa Maria ship drifted into a reef and had to be abandoned.
"There is a lot of water, a lot of history around Haiti, and there have been many, many shipwrecks along the coast of Haiti," said Daniel Koski-Karell, whose 1991 mission to confirm his hunch was thwarted by political turmoil.
"This ship that changed the course of human history needs to be protected and preserved for the Haitian people; that is much more valuable than gold," he said.
In it, Columbus told how his crew, with help from the native Indian population, had salvaged much of the ship and used the material to build a fort, La Navidad.
I could possibly change my mind if I were allowed to review the evidence of it."
"It was precisely where Christopher Columbus said it would be," he said of the Santa Maria.
On Aug. 3, 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail from Spain with three ships on his voyage to the New World.
Now, an underwater explorer says he is certain that he has found the long-lost Santa Maria.
"It was precisely where Christopher Columbus said it would be," he said of the Santa Maria.
Then he sailed the remaining two ships \u2014 La Nina and La Pinta \u2014 back to Spain to report what he had found.

Chicago-based Encyclopaedia Britannica is looking to regain its place as the king of household reference books.
"Whenever Britannica appears on search engines, we have a pretty amazing click-through rate."
The company owns Britannica.com, Merriam-Webster.com and more than 20 other reference websites, Cauz said.
Book sales fell drastically when people began getting their information online.
The company was sold in late 1995 to Swiss investor Jacob Safra, who ended its door-to-door sales.
Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia website written by volunteers, has nearly 4.6 million English language articles.
Cauz said that Britannica could potentially earn hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars from online advertising.
A Google search for Abraham Lincoln, for example, came up with nearly 3.5 million results, with a Wikipedia entry at the top of page 1.
The Britannica page also featured video and other ads for everything from Home Depot to a Chicago law office.
He hopes this will increase the number of readers.

President Barack Obama on Tuesday promised more than $33 billion in public and private investments in Africa, pledging that the United States wants to deliver business and development to the rapidly booming continent, where China already has a massive presence.
Obama made the remarks as he addressed the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, the first of its kind and the largest event any American president has held with African heads of state and government.
Other nations are already deeply invested in the continent, and the United States now realizes "we have some catching up to do \u2026 we are letting Europe and China go faster than the U.S.," said former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose Bloomberg Philanthropies hosted the summit, along with the U.S. Commerce Department.
Tanzania President Jakaya Kikwete echoed Obama\'s remarks, saying Africa still has its "hot spots," but that many of its 53 countries have changed over the past decade, with leaders endorsing strong economic and political policies.
Corruption in a number of countries hampers the U.S. to the benefit of countries like China, said Andrew Spalding, assistant professor at the University of Richmond School of Law and an expert on international business and corruption.
Chinese trade has grown more rapidly over the last decade than the United States, Schneidman said, but "the African market is so large and there\'s such an opportunity there and there\'s so many different needs that I think it\'s really about how do we get more U.S. companies into the continent."
If you\'re running a country, you\'ve got to try to create an opportunity for all of your businesses to be competitive," Clinton said of the agency that helps promote American businesses that want to sell products overseas.

As an undergraduate at UCLA in the 1970s, Helen Singleton often visited the student union building to see a mural she and six other students painted on a wall as a tribute to African-American history.
The artwork was a sepia-toned collage and a self-portrait of sorts, showing eight people staring at the interior of Ackerman Union, their faces and hair made up of small images of famous African-Americans.
But a few phone calls revealed that a wall had been placed in front of the mural and that it was probably still intact.
"It\'s what happens when you have people eating nearby," said Elizabeth Drolet, an assistant conservator at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County who worked on the project.
The mural was officially unveiled last Wednesday night at a ceremony attended by Angela Davis, Singleton and Neville Garrick, another student who had worked on the mural.

A beige wall stood in its place.
The killings set off demonstrations across the country.
Small images from those photos and many others became a collage filling most of the mural, which measured 10 feet by 27 feet.
Over the years, as the building became home to new chain and student-run restaurants and seating areas, the wall in front of the mural remained undisturbed.

The idea for the artwork was born of a violent campus protest on May 5, 1970, one day after Ohio National Guardsmen killed four students and wounded nine others who were protesting the Vietnam War at Kent State University.
They then gathered Ebony magazines and books and chose photos of important figures from African-American history.

It\'s called "the blob," and some blame it for the thousands of dead seabirds and emaciated sea lion pups that have washed ashore on California beaches since late last year.
At the center of this debate is a poorly understood pattern of wind, ocean current and temperature variations that some scientists call the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, or PDO.
Scientists believe that the Pacific Ocean began a cold phase in the late 1990s, and that this was largely responsible for an unexpected slowdown, or so-called pause, in global temperatures.
In the simplest sense, a warm PDO is El Nino-friendly, whereas a cool PDO is El Nino-repellent, according to Patzert.
One of the hallmarks of a warm PDO is the gathering of warm waters along the Pacific Coast of North America, a situation very similar to the blob, researchers say.
Scientists first described the PDO in 1997, after investigating the question of why Pacific salmon populations could flourish for years on end, then mysteriously collapse.
They identified a recurring pattern of interaction between the atmosphere and the sea that either cooled waters along the Pacific Coast or warmed them.
Although climatologists and oceanographers agree that PDO shifts are an inevitable fact of life, not all agree that the blob is signaling an immediate change.
He believes the warm mass of water is better explained by a stubborn region of high pressure parked over the northeast Pacific Ocean \u2014 the so-called ridiculously resilient ridge.
At Scripps Institution of Oceanography, climate researcher Dan Cayan said he was "cautiously pessimistic" over what the blob signaled about the future.
The thing that history tells us is that every situation is somewhat different."

After steering clear of most messy legislative battles, first lady Michelle Obama on Tuesday publicly took on lawmakers, food companies and lunch ladies who say the school lunch law she championed nearly four years ago is leading kids to brown bag it.
She blasted lawmakers for playing "politics with our kids\' health" and suggested they were trying to "roll back everything we have worked for."
"It\'s unacceptable to me not just as first lady, but also as a mother," she said.
The unusually confrontational remarks were a departure for a first lady who has largely sought to work with the food industry and around Congress in her campaign against [childhood obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity).
The House Appropriations Committee is to vote Thursday on a provision that would allow school districts that have been operating at a loss to seek a one-year waiver from the nutrition guidelines.
Some districts say they have had trouble finding affordable products that meet the nutrition standards; meanwhile, they say, they have watched students throw away large amounts of the healthy food that land on their trays.
This temporary one-year waiver simply throws them a lifeline," said Brian Rell, a spokesman for Republican Rep. Robert B. Aderholt of Alabama, chairman of the Appropriations Committee\'s agriculture subcommittee, which approved the provision on a voice vote last week.
White House officials helped with a letter by former presidents of the School Nutrition Association opposing the waiver plan.
Officials argued against having lawmakers determine what is nutritious, noting that lawmakers have bent to food industry complaints in the past, such as an effort in 2011 to classify pizza with tomato sauce as a vegetable.
"What we\'re not going to do is put politics and interests ahead of what\'s good for our kids and allow politicians to set nutrition standards," said Sam Kass, director of the first lady\'s anti-obesity campaign and the White House chef.
Binkle noted that he was a member of the School Nutrition Association, but said its "hard line" on the law did not reflect his views.
Binkle said he had not had trouble procuring food that meets the federal guidelines or stricter local nutrition standards and noted that the "plate waste" critics point to was a problem before the 2010 law.

"The philosophy is inch-wide, mile-deep," said Tim Wyant, executive director of the New York-based National Urban Squash and Education Association.
Joshua Smith, 13, was one of the skeptics when recruiters visited his middle school last year.
"When the students of SquashSmarts grow up to become the academic directors, the squash directors, the executive directors of this program," said Gregg, "that, to me, is change in a community."
Sakora Miller remembers being puzzled when a group of strangers visited her gym class in tough west Philadelphia and offered to teach them a sport.
Everyone already knew how to play basketball, the most popular game in the neighborhood, she recalled thinking.

A funny thing happened to Sakora Miller on the way to gym a decade ago.
Everyone already knew how to play basketball, the most popular game in the neighborhood, she remembers thinking.
And supporters hope to start four more programs this year.
The popularity of squash has jumped dramatically in the U.S.
Program growth was aided by a lucky coincidence.
Joshua Smith, 13, was one of the doubters when recruiters visited his middle school last year.
Being able to hire Sakora Miller as squash director brings the program full circle, he said.
Miller is now 23 and is finishing an online degree from Penn State.

But they get tutoring and travel opportunities that most kids in inner-city neighborhoods just dream about.
The number of players rose from about 600,000 in 2007 to nearly 1.3 million in 2012.
The first inner-city program was began by a former squash teacher in Boston in 1995.
The district has a big high school dropout rate.
The game is played with a racquet, like racquetball or tennis.
The program combined fitness with tutoring.
Hiring Miller brings the program full circle, he said.
When a SquashSmarts student becomes one of the heads of the program that "is change in a community," Gregg said.
Art spending by Latin Americans also leapt last year, while Russian and Middle Eastern collectors continue to pay record prices.
In sales of Impressionist, modern and Surrealist art starting Feb. 4, Christie\'s has Pablo Picasso\'s "Woman in a Turkish Costume," a portrait of his wife and muse Jacqueline Roque \u2014 estimated at up to 20 million pounds \u2014 and Juan Gris\' Cubist "Still Life with Checked Tablecloth," valued at up to 18 million pounds.
A few blocks away at Sotheby\'s, sales that start Feb. 5 include Vincent Van Gogh\'s "Man is at Sea," once owned by actor Errol Flynn; Lucian Freud\'s portrait "Head on a Green Sofa"; and works by Claude Monet, Marc Chagall and Henri Matisse.
Want to sell that masterpiece for a fortune?
It\'s the color of the sunset, it\'s the color of blood," he said.
There is some evidence to support this theory \u2014 four of the five most expensive Richters ever sold are red.
Sotheby\'s says there\'s a chance "Wall" could smash expectations and beat the $37.1 million record for a living painter.
"When I started in this industry, it was really European and American (buyers)," said Jay Vincze, head of Christie\'s Impressionist and modern department.
There are also multimillion-dollar works by Piet Mondrian, Rene Magritte, Fernand Leger and Joan Miro.

Overweight people are at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and other diseases.
Mexicans would pay an extra peso (7.6 cents) for every liter of sugary drinks that they buy.
They would also pay a tax on flavored drinks, concentrates, powders and syrups.
Many countries are calling for taxes or size limits on sugar-sweetened beverages.
France, Finland, Algeria and Hungary have all imposed taxes on sugary drinks.
Critics derided it as part of an over-reaching "nanny state."
"A 10 percent increase in the price should result in a 10 to 12 percent decrease in consumption," said Roberta R. Friedman.
Friedman said soft drink consumption has been linked to obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dental disease and gout.
As it stands, the tax only amounts to about 10 percent of the cost of a soda bottle.
He said some of the money should go toward putting drinking fountains back in schools and public places.
The money collected will broaden programs that help the poor.
But he said a higher tax would have a greater impact on public health.
The tax only amounts to about 10 percent of the cost of a bottle of soda.
But a New York appellate court shot down his effort to stop restaurants from selling soft drinks in cups larger than 16 ounces.
Mexicans would pay an extra peso (7.6 cents) for every liter of sugary drinks they buy.
One public health expert said studies show that a tax on sugar-sweetened drinks in the United States would make people drink them less.
Friedman said soft drink consumption has been linked to several diseases.
The tax is expected to be 2 billion pesos.
In what may be a first for a long-extinct nonhuman animal \u2014 and certainly for an extinct creature of such stature \u2014 scientists have assembled the complete genome of the woolly mammoth, gaining insight into why the last surviving population of the great beasts, marooned on an Arctic island off the coast of Russia, may have disappeared.
The animals are particularly interesting to paleobiologists because they were among the last surviving members of their species.
To figure that out, the team first had to find woolly mammoth bits well-preserved enough to sequence.
Eventually they chose soft tissue from a juvenile male that lived in northeastern Siberia around 44,800 years ago and a molar from a Wrangel Island male mammoth that lived about 4,300 years ago.

The analysis could help scientists understand why species die out, and if genetic factors have to do with it, Palkopoulou said.
"Your genome is like your tool kit for getting out of trouble," said Ian Barnes, an evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum in London.
"If you as a species have lots of different tools available, it means some individuals will die when the environment changes or a disease arrives, but there will probably be others that will be resistant and will pass those genes on to the next generation.

In what may be a first for a long-extinct nonhuman animal, scientists have assembled the genome \u2014 the complete set of genes \u2014 of the woolly mammoth.
An international team reported their findings Thursday.
The other lived much earlier in mainland Siberia.
They died out only 4,000 years ago, some 6,000 years after their relatives had vanished from mainland Siberia.
Palkopoulou and the others wanted to see if the Wrangel Island mammoths had less genetic diversity \u2014 less genetic variety \u2014 than their mainland Siberian ancestors.
Genes are made up of DNA molecules, which can be thought of as a set of instructions that makes each species \u2014 and each individual \u2014 what it is.
The more varied the DNA of a particular population, the more likely it is that the population will be able to adapt to changes in the environment.
To figure out if that was true, the team first had to find woolly mammoth bits well-preserved enough to study.

Instead it displayed a rap lyric that made reference to the very spot Castillo had just blown past.
After about "a cigarette and a half," Castillo held one of his most treasured pieces of street art.
Growing up in the suburbs of New York, he was surrounded by music; he and his friends drove into the city to see live hip-hop and as he got older, some became DJs and producers.
But by then, the scavenger hunt had already begun, and most of the signs were gone.
Clasped to the streetlight pole in front of the sneaker store Flight Club, a bright red sign with white text stared him in the face.
Though it had the look of a standard street sign, it offered no instructions on parking, driving or walking.
Rappers including Murs, Action Bronson and Lupe Fiasco have given big ups to the project via social media, sometimes posting pictures of their sign on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter.
Soon he was sending mass emails and solicitations on social media asking for any rap lyric that mentioned a very specific location.
Tony Castillo skateboarded down Fairfax Avenue as he had for more than two years, but on one December morning he noticed something new.
Years later, in his home studio on the Upper East Side, Big L\'s track "Lifestylez Ov Da Poor &amp; Dangerous" started playing one day.
There he saw words he had rapped at age 17 "just for fun" with his friend Casey Veggies.
(And) I had seen those quotes when I go to New York sometimes, so I was like, \'This is legendary.\'"

If he\'s successful, he\'ll join what U.S. officials are calling "the surge" \u2014 the dramatic increase in [child migrants](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Central+american+emigration) flooding across the U.S. border, creating what President Barack Obama calls an "urgent humanitarian situation."
Coxaj, whose thick black hair and short stature denote his Mayan roots, spoke with the determination of someone needing to provide urgent economic support for his single mother and younger brother.
"I am not with a coyote," he said, referring to the paid human traffickers who usher some migrants northward.
The only likely way for them to do so is to travel with coyotes working in collusion with crime groups.
Young said the average age of unaccompanied children apprehended by border agents has dropped.
Doing a back of the envelope calculation that some 180,000 migrants arrive in Mexico every six months, Vigne added: "Are you telling me that nearly one in four is an unaccompanied minor?
"I am not with a coyote," he said, referring to the paid human traffickers who usher some migrants northward.
The only option is to leave the country or join the rival gang."
When adolescents take off from Central America, he said, they "band together with others from their hometowns.
The diplomat said few minors are like Wilson Coxaj, the 16-year-old literally alone on the journey.

Between Oct. 1, 2013, and May 31, the total number of young people reached 47,017, the Department of Homeland Security says.
The unaccompanied minors have crammed into Border Patrol stations and forced U.S. officials to set up temporary facilities for them at military bases in Texas, Oklahoma and California.
"The Mara Salvatrucha (gang) dominates the streets, and they wanted me to join them to sell drugs," said William Alberto Molina, who left San Salvador last year at age 17.
"Violence in Central America is pushing these kids out," said Wendy Young, the executive director of Kids in Need of Defense, a Washington, D.C., group that provides legal help for immigrant children.

Coyotes are the paid human guides who help some illegal immigrants cross the border.
Between Oct. 1, 2013, and May 31, the U.S. government says, 47,017 young people illegally crossed the border.
So many have come without parents that the government has set up housing for them at military bases in Texas, Oklahoma and California.
The rapper/singer celebrity couple popularized a small but growing travel phenomenon that taps a pent-up demand to visit Cuba, an exotic time-locked land still off-limits to U.S. tourists.
They have been reluctant to make further changes in policy until Cuban authorities release Alan Gross, of Maryland, who was jailed in December 2009 for alleged "crimes against the state" for bringing satellite-communications equipment to the island.
"People were Googling it and curious.
"Not everybody wants to travel that way," he acknowledged.
Everything from our call center to our website to our blog to our Facebook page just lit up," said Tom Popper, president of Insight Cuba.
We need to try something new."
More Americans are now seeking similar "people-to-people" culture tours.
But others in Congress want to make it easier for Americans to legally visit Cuba.
Roughly 400,000 Cuban-American passengers went to Cuba last year.
These must include visits to places such as senior centers, schools and artist studios.
It is making Americans aware that they can visit Cuba legally through these culture tours.
But supporters of expanded travel hope that recent reforms in Cuba will spur Obama to further loosen U.S. travel rules.
An estimated 90,000 Americans made these "people-to-people" visits last year.
These must include visits to places such as senior centers, schools and artist studios.
Going without the proper permission can run the risk of a huge fine.

There are plans, too, to hire several people with autism to aid in the process.
In his eyes, those in attendance represented the perfect focus group, and when it became clear that their feedback was highly positive, Jackson says, it helped solidify his belief that the chair could benefit children on a widespread scale.
For Jackson, whose son, Joshua, is on the severe end of the autism spectrum, the project has also taken on a personal significance.
"Literally within 30 seconds of testing, I knew that it was probably going to be a big deal," said Keith Manbeck, an instructor with the CAPS program.
On a Saturday morning last month, for instance, during the first annual Just Be You Walk for Autism in Kansas City, a steady stream of children \u2014 many of them somewhere on the autism spectrum \u2014 wandered toward a model of the Sensory Lounger for a test run.
"He\'s so chill," marveled Alison Anderson, as her 6-year-old son, Max, sat nestled in one of the two models on hand.
In the year and a half or so since a group of Kansas City-area students in a school district engineering program helped bring it to fruition, the Sensory Lounger has enjoyed quite a run.

To this end, he said the company is looking to hire people with autism for three to four part-time jobs that will start over the summer.
There are also plans to hire several people with autism to aid in the process.
He hopes to get the Sensory Lounger inside as many therapy centers, classrooms and homes as possible.
Certain kinds of touch like a tight hug help children with autism calm down.
Many therapists at the conference knew of patients or students who would benefit from the Sensory Lounger.
"It\'s one thing to build something and just kind of get it out there," Edmonson says.
"Now," Jackson says, "it\'s on the verge of being a potential solution to families across the world."
Food dyes have been controversial since pediatrician Benjamin Feingold published findings in the 1970s that suggested a link between artificial colors and hyperactive behavior, but scientists, consumers and the government have not yet reached a consensus on the extent of this risk or the correct path to address it.
The FDA convened a Food Advisory Committee meeting in 2011 to review the existing research, and concluded that there was not sufficient evidence proving that foods with artificial colors caused hyperactivity in the general population.
The FDA also decided that further research was needed, and that a label disclosing a possible link between dyes and hyperactivity was unnecessary.
But Joel Nigg, professor of psychiatry, pediatrics and behavioral neuroscience at Oregon Health & Science University, says the studies support the link between dyes and hyperactivity.
"Do you want to take a chance that these initial studies are wrong and put kids at risk or do you want to take a chance that they\'re right?
Studies have also shown removing foods containing artificial dyes via restriction diets can successfully decrease hyperactivity but Nigg says this is likely because removing processed foods in general is healthier and results in better behavioral outcomes for children with ADHD.
They are two of the nine certified colors that food manufacturers must list on ingredient labels.
5 can cause an allergic reaction for one out of every 10,000 people.
"All the evidence we have has showed that it has some capacity to harm," he says.
In this country it\'s up to the government to find out whether or not there are harmful effects."
Instead, the pasta will maintain its bright yellow color by using natural ingredients: paprika, turmeric and annatto (the latter of which is derived from achiote tree seeds).

5 and 6 have been in use since the early 1900s, and the FDA approved them for use in 1969 and 1986, respectively.
An April 2015 study looked at how much dye was in recommended servings of processed foods; it found Kraft Macaroni & Cheese contained 17.6 milligrams of Yellow Nos.
Because the chemicals are so similar in color, and thus difficult to tell apart in measurements, the researchers chose the dye that allowed the highest concentration.
Nigg says the FDA should require manufacturers to include a label saying artificial colors could affect hyperactivity in some children, like the E.U.
Kraft Macaroni & Cheese \u2014 that favorite food of kids, packaged in the nostalgic blue box \u2014 will soon be free of yellow dye.
Kraft announced Monday that it will remove artificial food coloring, notably Yellow No.

The company said it decided to pull the dyes because more consumers want natural foods.
But claims that the dyes may be linked to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children have also risen recently.
However, some research studies have found that the dyes can contribute to hyperactive behavior in children.
A 2007 study in the United Kingdom showed that artificial colors, and the common preservative sodium benzoate, increased hyperactivity in children.

U.S. aircraft began flying missions over northeastern Nigeria trying to trace the girls, according to The Associated Press.
The newspaper cited several other parents, who did not give their names, who also did not see their children on the video.
In the video, insurgent leader Abubakar Shekau said he was willing to exchange some of the girls for Boko Haram prisoners held by Nigeria.
The Nigerian government has said it will do everything necessary to free the girls without specifying whether it would be willing to negotiate a prisoner exchange with the group, which is designated a terror organization by the U.S. government.
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan asked parliament to extend a state of emergency in the area.
The newspaper cited several other parents, who did not give their names, who also did not see their children on the video.
He said the militant group was holding many other people but gave no number.
Some argue that a prisoner exchange would only encourage further abductions.

ICAGO \u2013 On their first day of training, one mother after another paused in the classroom doorway, unsure where to sit or whether signing up for this highly regarded parent program was a good idea after all.
In the Logan Square schools, where the program has the longest track record, principals and teachers credit the parents with helping many students improve in math and reading.
They also believe parents contribute to harder-to-measure but equally important areas such as student motivation.
Before the program started, a few Funston parents would show up to help each day, but the principal wanted to attract those who dropped off their kids each morning and never ventured inside.
From the beginning, the program was designed as a partnership, with the hope that teachers would learn as much from parents as parents would gain from watching and talking with teachers.

Certainly, too much parent involvement can cause problems, as happens in some high-income schools.
Soo Hong, a professor at Wellesley College, said students "are quite moved and inspired by having their parents being involved in the school."
And, she said, it makes them more accountable, adding, "Students know if they start messing up in the classroom ... sure, maybe it\'s not their mother who\'s there, but it\'s their aunt\'s neighbor or somebody they know."
Mucino had come to the U.S. from Mexico as a teenager and saw herself as "just" a stay-at-home mom, with nothing to offer teachers.
But she found that she had a knack for helping students, and when the teacher had to leave the class briefly, he would encourage her, "You know what to do."
Ishimaru said the conversation often neglects "the folks who have the most at stake and sometimes the most expertise on their own children."

A new reality TV show unfolded this year in a cave in a sandstone cliff about 75 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
He also stared at his toes, lifting each one in turn as though playing a piano.
Scientists and volunteer nest guardians could only speculate on what was happening in the caves and hollowed-out redwood trees where condors lay one egg a year.
In Missoula, Montana, cameras placed in an osprey nest are being used to identify the species of fish the birds are bringing home from a nearby river.
In late October, the young condor failed to return from one of its first short flights from the nest.
Fish and Wildlife Service, is making management of the nest significantly safer for birds and scientists alike.
"Prior to video, we routinely entered condor nests every 30 days to collect the harmful micro-trash they bring home," including bottle caps, electronics parts, broken glass and wire, said Joseph Brandt, a condor biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service.
Scientists also took blood samples and vaccinated for West Nile virus.
The biggest hurdle is that condor nests are in remote areas, which makes transmitting video difficult.
The video is streamed to researchers and later edited and archived at the Santa Barbara Zoo.
Development encroached on condor habitat, and the now-banned pesticide DDT made condor eggshells so thin they often could not support life.
Some of the birds were shot or died of lead poisoning when they fed upon the carcasses of other animals killed with lead shot and bullets.
Scientists began recovery efforts by capturing the few remaining wild condors, breeding them in captivity and releasing the birds in their historical range.
Barring major setbacks, the vulture that scientists know as Gymnogyps californianus may be eligible for down-listing from endangered to threatened within a few decades, researchers say.
On a recent weekday, Brandt, Astelle and Devon Pryor, a conservation and research associate at the Santa Barbara Zoo, released three rehabilitated adult condors into the furrowed mountains of Ventura County.
Then, with black-and-white wings flapping hard, they rose into the brilliant blue sky.
Like all California condors, the 20-pounders had been fitted with number tags and radio transmitters to allow scientists to track their movements.

A Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas health care worker who had "extensive contact" with the first Ebola patient to die in the United States has contracted the disease.
The director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Sunday that the infection in the health care worker, who was not on the organization\'s watch list for people who had contact with Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, resulted from a "breach in protocol."
The CDC has sent additional staff members to Dallas to "assist with the response," he said.
He cautioned: "Unfortunately, it is possible in the coming days we will see additional cases of Ebola" in health care workers.
Texas Health Commissioner David Lakey said the health care worker had "extensive contact" with Duncan.
Duncan, the first person to die of Ebola in the United States, went to the Presbyterian emergency room Sept. 26 and was sent home with antibiotics only to return to the hospital on Sept. 28.
She was just an innocent woman who took care of someone who was sick," said neighbor Colleen Watson said.

A blood sample sent to the state health lab in Austin confirmed Saturday night that she had Ebola \u2014 the first person to contract the deadly disease in the United States.
Although the CDC didn\'t consider her to be at "high risk" of contracting Ebola, she had been checking herself for signs of the disease, including taking her temperature twice a day.
Ebola is fatal in 50 percent to 80 percent of people who get it, and there is no proven vaccine or cure yet.
Police officers and a CDC representative talked to residents of the apartment complex Sunday morning and distributed information about Ebola symptoms.
Carpenter, who works in a nearby hospital, said she hopes Presbyterian Hospital investigates how the nurse contracted Ebola.

He brought the deadly disease with him from Africa when he came to visit relatives in Dallas.
Frieden said a person can get Ebola from even a single accidental slipup.
It is spread through direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person.
Duncan died Oct. 8.
She said she hopes Presbyterian Hospital investigates how the nurse got Ebola.
The rest look suspiciously like other species, and poisonous ones at that.
But while mimicry has long been studied, it remains something of a mystery just how it becomes restricted to females of a species.
In this butterfly, in this one species at least, it is just one gene.
Exactly what mutations may be responsible for which colors remains a mystery that Kronforst plans to explore.
Other broad questions remain too.
"Basically what the butterflies have done is they have grabbed this mechanism that they already use to tell males from females, and they\'re using it again to tell females that you\'ll like A, B, C or D," Kronforst said.

After growing up poor in a predominantly African-American neighborhood of Cincinnati, the young adults had reached their early 20s.
"What we found \u2014 and continue to find \u2014 is that lead sowed the seeds of their future," said Kim Dietrich, a neuropsychologist who has been following the group of nearly 300 people since they were born in the late 1970s.
Sampson recently added lead data to his existing research on poverty, education and crime in Englewood and other neighborhoods.
A map of lead poisoning rates among children younger than 6 in 1995, for instance, looks very similar to a map of aggravated assault rates in 2012, when those kids were 17 to 22 years old.
The link between childhood lead exposure and violent behavior is well-established, both in animal research and human studies like the one in Cincinnati.

Mountain residents and the Fresno County sheriff are squaring off against a federal wildlife agency over frogs and toads in an Endangered Species Act fight that is spreading like wildfire along the Sierra Nevada range.
Fish and Wildlife leaders say they are not proposing to shut down forests.
The service also proposed designating 1.83 million acres of critical habitat for the amphibians.
The areas are considered essential for the frogs and toads to survive.
But the U.S. Forest Service plans were designed to protect large, old trees, where the owls liked to live.
Most lumber mills shut down in this part of the mountain range.
They say there may be a misunderstanding about the 1.83 million acres that are labeled a critical habitat.

"There is history in those plants, and (the youth) are carrying it genetically forward," said Diane Wilson, executive director of the nonprofit, as she watched the teens pulling up vegetables.
In 2003, the nonprofit purchased a 10-acre farm outside the city of Hugo in Washington County, Minn., and began its agricultural and health care experiment.
Baker died but the seeds kept coming.
The groups have a big task before them.
The farm also grows organic vegetables, which its teenage "Garden Warriors" were harvesting last week.

In the next cage, a pit bull snarls and bares his teeth at passing strangers.
Animal advocates are trying desperate measures to address the problem.
Pit bulls have been both glorified and victimized by their reputation.
Their growing numbers at shelters have run counter to what otherwise has been a great success in animal care in recent decades.
But pit bulls appear to end up in shelters far out of proportion to their numbers.
For those looking to own a pet, pit bulls are seemingly everywhere.
Mark George, head of the Chicago police animal crimes unit, said dogfighting is not as much of a problem as it was in 2007, when NFL star Michael Vick was sentenced to prison for it.
She says the breed is popular both with "thugs" who often mistreat them and with rescuers who fall in love with them.
About half the dogs the shelter gets are strays; others are surrendered by their owners.

The Pentagon is outfitting a 647-foot cargo ship with high-tech equipment in an effort to safely destroy hundreds of tons of lethal chemical weapons agents that were collected in Syria after a deadly gas attack this summer sparked an international outcry.
Two specially developed hydrolysis machines, which use water or bleach to neutralize the chemicals that produce nerve gases, have been installed aboard the Cape Ray at the U.S. naval base in Norfolk, Va., officials said Thursday.
Plans call for trucking the arsenal from a series of collection sites to the Syrian port of Latakia, where it will be loaded into 150 Teflon-lined shipping containers.
Norway has offered to ferry the sealed containers from Latakia to an as-yet-unnamed port outside Syria, where they will be transferred to the Cape Ray, the officials said.
No U.S. government personnel will be in Syria to assist with the operation and no U.S. military forces will be involved in protecting the Syrian trucks as they transport the chemical agents to Latakia.
The modified ship is expected to undergo a sea trial this month and be ready to sail early next year.
The Pentagon has used hydrolysis machines to help destroy parts of its own once-vast chemical weapons stockpile, although never before on a ship.
The liquid will be stored aboard the Cape Ray, which will be manned by about 60 Defense Department civilians and contractors, until arrangements can be made to destroy it at a commercial waste treatment facility.

Corner stores and small supermarkets that feed vast swaths of impoverished Philadelphia offer bacteria-laced foods in unhealthy conditions that can lead to foodborne illness, a Drexel University study shows.
For years, advocates for the poor have endeavored to keep people alive, conjuring ways to get fruits, vegetables and other staples into so-called food deserts like North Philadelphia.
Recent federal estimates show that of 9.4 million cases of foodborne illness in the United States in a year, fewer than 1,500 resulted in death.
For example, many corner store owners get milk from larger stores, and transport it in their own cars, scientists at Yale University found.
But, she added, from a microbiologist\'s perspective, "if people can\'t store and keep food safely, you\'re not doing them any favors getting them that food."
"Potatoes and baby food are moldy, lettuce is rotten, and the mice are having a good time in boxes of noodles," said Rodney Jenkins, 47, an unemployed North Philadelphia man.
Recent federal estimates show that of 9.4 million cases of foodborne illness in the United States in a year, fewer than 1,500 resulted in death.
A customer then finds the milk goes bad much sooner than on-carton expiration dates indicate.
Because the smell of spoiled milk keeps anyone from drinking it, the result for an individual is not foodborne illness but wasted dollars, Quinlan said.
Poor people understand that they have few options in protecting themselves from bad food.

The challenge of keeping Ebola from becoming a global problem is not principally a security problem.
Be it sandbagging during storms or delivering supplies and rescue services after disaster strikes, our military is skilled at alleviating non-military emergencies.
The right measure of these missions is whether or not they are suitable, feasible and acceptable.

Containment is urgent, they say, because the lizards will eat just about anything \u2014 small mammals, birds, insects, plants, and their all-time favorite \u2014 eggs.
It could also mean lights out for the endangered Key Largo wood rat \u2014 not to mention other native creatures.
Eckles and others tracking them say they often find tegus out in the open during the hottest time of day.
The animals hibernate in burrows from October until about January or February, then emerge once again to forage and reproduce.
Tegus are very difficult to catch by hand and are much easier to trap using eggs as bait, according to Jake Edwards, a wildlife technician hired by FWC to capture the lizards in South Florida.
Asked whether he was concerned that the pets he sells may end up right back in the Everglades abandoned, Irwin responded that none of his customers are local and, in any case, they could buy a tegu in a pet store.
"When we first found out about them in 2008, we thought we had a chance to nip this population in the bud," said the National Park Service\'s Tony Pernas, who co-chairs the Everglades Cooperative Invasive Species Management Area group.

Sommers said the FWC is still gathering information,  and trying to figure out the potential of tegus expanding even farther afield and what the impact of that would be.
Within the next year, the agency will have enough data to be able to determine its next steps.
These were found mainly on public lands and were killed humanely, according to Eckles.

No solution was likely before Tuesday at the earliest, and the Republican lawmaker who helped trigger the gridlock took credit in a message to supporters that also sought donations to his presidential campaign.
In a rare Sunday session, they abandoned their opposition to the House bill in the face of exhortations by the president and senior intelligence officials to pass it quickly.
"We call on the Senate to ensure this irresponsible lapse in authorities is as short-lived as possible," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement issued Sunday night.
What they most fear is a legislative impasse that could doom the programs permanently.
While Paul sought to capitalize on his position, House-passed legislation was stalled in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other leading Republicans sought changes.
"We\'ll have a vote on that legislation as soon as we can," he said, without specifying a timeline.
But he pointedly did not rule out revisions.
But with no other options, McConnell, in an about-face, reluctantly embraced the House-passed bill Sunday night.
For at least a little while, you will not have to worry about the NSA listening in on your phone conversations.
On Monday, parts of that act expired after Congress failed to meet the deadline for their renewal.
Legislation that would have renewed surveillance laws had already passed in the House of Representatives, but became stalled in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other leading Republicans sought changes.
McConnell said that the proposed changes to the House-approved legislation are modest.
However, he pointedly did not rule out revisions.
While intelligence officials publicly warned of danger, they said they were not deeply concerned with a lapse of a few days or weeks, given that surveillance will still be permitted in ongoing investigations.

Paul cares more about "his fundraising and his ambitions" than he does about the safety of the nation, McCain said.
As part of its surveillance, the NSA has been collecting millions of phone calls.
Many people feel that NSA surveillance goes too far.
A new set of surveillance laws called the USA Freedom Act was eventually introduced.
Under the USA Freedom Act, the NSA will no longer be able to collect phone records.
The Act passed in the House of Representatives on May 13.
Then, it went on to the Senate, which needs to pass it too before the act can become law.
A group of senators led by Mitch McConnell announced that they do not like the USA Freedom Act.
A vote was delayed and the deadline passed.
"This is what we fought the Revolution over.

President Barack Obama laid a wreath at the World War I memorial at Flanders Field on Wednesday, noting the war that tore apart Europe still echoes in conflicts 100 years later.
On Tuesday, Obama repeated threats of more painful economic sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin sends troops into other regions of the former Soviet state.
Other European nations are worried about the effect that broader sanctions would have on their own fragile economies.
In a morning ceremony at the cemetery west of Brussels, Obama, Belgian King Philippe and Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo placed wreaths at a monument erected to the missing dead.

They want reparations, or payment, for the wrong of sponsoring and endorsing kidnapping, enslaving and selling Africans.
In recent weeks, the movement for reparations has been building steam, occupying the attention of leaders of the 15-member Caribbean Community regional bloc.
Those leaders have unanimously agreed to make a moral, ethical and \u2014 if necessary \u2014 legal case for the former colonial powers to pay up.
But if Europeans are willing to listen, their governments may not be so inclined.

ICAGO - Eight-year-old Claire Dormanen assumed her role as a summer camper this month in many traditional ways: She wore a comfy T-shirt and shorts, scarfed down a sack lunch and ran frantically to escape elimination during a game of dodgeball.
"For me, the idea of having kids coding at 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years old is just absurd," said Jim Taylor, an adjunct professor of psychology at the University of San Francisco and author of "Raising Generation Tech: Preparing Your Children for a Media-Fueled World."
Proponents argue that children should learn coding for several reasons.
"It\'s not that kids should be learning this because they want to be going to work at Google and Microsoft and Facebook," Lazowska said.
Within weeks after Wil Greenwald, owner of Code Play Learn, introduced weeklong code/sports summer camps for kindergartners through sixth-graders, nearly all 70 available spots were filled.
After lunch, campers fill up water bottles, fasten their sneakers and spend the afternoon playing soccer, dodgeball, elimination hand hockey and other fast-paced games.
At any time of the day, campers can head to a classroom equipped with iPads to play a video game that teaches coding or use a program to develop their own apps.
By offering coding alongside bread-making, dance, water slides and music, the camp is able to provide valuable technological lessons without the complicated process that comes with changing school curriculum, Chun added.
Hintch said she could understand why the parents of children who are always behind a computer might take issue with coding at camp.
"It\'s a great balance, it\'s really a good thing."

Coding was once reserved for students who wanted to work in the tech industry.
This new option appears next to the more traditional camp activities like arts and crafts, soccer and rock climbing.
It also meets the new demand from parents who are eager to expose their children to the latest technology and potential careers in STEM fields: science, technology, engineering and math.
Some parents and digital experts question the need to teach young children computer coding.

For years, football helmets have had to meet a relatively simple standard.
His Pennsylvania-based company, Unequal Technologies, sells Kevlar-fortified pads meant to supplement a helmet\'s existing inner cushioning, which he derides as "couch foam."
He said his products act like a trampoline, dispersing the energy of a blow across a wide surface area and reducing the severity of the impact.
Some, including Riddell and Schutt, a sporting goods manufacturer based in downstate Litchfield, have said they will do just that.

Black holes are regions of space with a gravitational pull so powerful that everything around them gets sucked into them, including light.
Astronomers have known for years that hyper-dense black holes also shoot matter into the universe.
However, nobody knew exactly what type of material the jets were spewing.
Now, that black hole mystery may have been solved.
Everyone was in agreement that the jets would contain electrons, which have a negative charge.
Some models of the jets suggested they were shooting lightweight electrons and positrons away from the black hole and into the universe.
But other scientists were not convinced: They thought the jets were made of much heavier normal matter.
It takes a lot more energy to move normal matter than it would to move lightweight electrons and positrons.
Black holes can expand \u2014 or "feed" \u2014 by sucking in matter around them.
But the second time the team looked, the radio waves seemed to indicate the jets were on.

It takes much more energy to move normal matter than to move lightweight electrons and positrons.
Or do they come from the disk of matter that surrounds the black hole?
But the second time the team looked, the radio waves seemed to show the jets were on.

SHINGTON - The Justice Department sued North Carolina on Monday in a bid to block a new state law that forces voters to present a photo identification before casting a ballot and limits early voting, arguing the measure discriminates against minorities.
The suit marked the second time in recent months that the Democratic Obama administration has challenged a voting law enacted by a Republican-led state.
The North Carolina law is one of a series enacted in Republican-governed states imposing new requirements on casting ballots.
Democrats assert that the laws are intended to make it harder for blacks and other voters who are likely to vote for Democratic candidates to cast their ballots.
Republican Governor Pat McCrory signed North Carolina\'s sweeping voting changes into law in August, saying at the time: "Common practices like boarding an airplane and purchasing Sudafed (a common decongestant) require photo ID, and we should expect nothing less for the protection of our right to vote."
For civil rights advocates, recent changes echo the earlier, century-long fight to win voting rights for black Americans in the U.S. South.
Under that section, the federal government will have to prove that discrimination was both the intent behind the North Carolina law and its effect.
The Justice Department has approved of them in some states such as Virginia that take steps to ensure that IDs are available at little to no cost, but not in states where it said the mandate would be a burden on the poor and minorities.
The case was assigned to a federal judge in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Democrats assert that the laws are intended to make it harder for blacks and other voters who are likely to vote for Democratic candidates to cast their ballots.
Civil rights groups filed suit against the law immediately after it was signed, and Democratic U.S.
More than 70 percent of blacks who voted in the November 2008 and 2012 elections in North Carolina did so in this early period, according to the Justice Department.
"I believe that North Carolina is in the mainstream on this issue, and it\'s the Justice Department that\'s working in the fringes," he added.

SHINGTON - The U.S. Justice Department sued North Carolina on Monday over a new state law that forces people to present a photo identification before voting and that limits early voting.
Attorney General Eric Holder said the North Carolina law imposes several "troubling new restrictions" on voters.
Democrats say that the laws are intended to make it harder for blacks and other people who are likely to vote Democratic cast their ballots.
He said he was especially troubled that the law would significantly shorten the early voting period.
Civil rights advocates say recent changes echo the earlier, century-long fight to win voting rights for black Americans in the U.S. South.
That part of the law prohibits state voting practices or procedures that discriminate by race.

Holder said the North Carolina law imposes several "troubling new restrictions" on voters.

Voters fill out those ballots when there are questions about his or her registration; *   -- and the adoption of an ID requirement that is stricter than the Justice Department allows.
Requiring voters to show identification has been a major issue.
Those states take steps to ensure that IDs are available at little to no cost.
Holder said the North Carolina law places several "troubling new restrictions" on voters.
They prevent cheating, Republicans say.
The federal government had previously used the law to challenge state voting rules.
Voters fill out those ballots when there are questions about whether they can actually vote; *   -- and the adoption of an ID rule that is stricter than the Justice Department allows.
Civil rights supporters say recent changes remind them of the earlier fight to win voting rights for black Americans in the U.S. South.
The federal government will have to prove two things in order to win the lawsuit.

Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Massimov made a last-minute impassioned plea for the IOC to be "brave" and give the games to his country.
Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, called it a "a slap in the face to China\'s besieged human rights activists."
Beijing and Almaty had both been considered longshots when the 2022 bid race opened two years ago.

Bach reacted defensively when asked at a news conference about the possibility of any voting misconduct.
Kazakh Prime Minister Karim Massimov made a last-minute impassioned plea for the IOC to be "brave" and give the Games to his country.
I think that\'s why it got close, but the size of China, the number of people that are going to be introduced to winter sport now, those were all factors."
Bach pointed out that the world is becoming truly globalized and Asia is growing more important in all areas of life.
In more than 120 years of modern Olympic history, no city has been chosen to host both the winter and summer games - until now.
Beijing will soon be the only city in history to have hosted both the Winter and Summer Olympic Games.

The 18-foot giant found off Santa Catalina Island on Oct. 13 was among the largest oarfish reported in nearly 20 years.
Results from the research could take years to complete, scientists said.
Staff members at the Catalina Island Marine Institute considered burying their 18-foot oarfish carcass, which was too large to refrigerate.
The fish was divided among various research institutions because there was so much interest, he said.
"Social media allows us to distribute those, and get information back to scientists."
One claim working its way around websites and blogs is that an oarfish dying is a sign of a coming earthquake.
Experts, however, stressed that they have not yet pinpointed a cause of death.
In his hometown of Kabul, Afghanistan, Salim lives with his parents, six brothers, and a crew of aunts, uncles and cousins - 21 people in all.
Since arriving in the United States, Salim has had an operation to repair his left arm.
In 2014, he was chosen by Solace for the Children to come to the Hanger Clinic in Charlotte, North Carolina, for medical care.
The Hanger Clinic is world-renowned for helping people who have lost limbs.
Scar tissue had also formed over his arm pit, leaving him with limited range of motion.
In late August the doctors operated.
Recently, Salim and his host mother, Tabor-Gray, went back to see Gaston and Jenks so they could remove his stitches and make sure everything was healing well.
Salim, who speaks a variety of Persian called Dari, but also understands and speaks some English, smiled shyly.
He politely complied when Gaston asked him to move his arm forward, back, up and down.

As proof that he can successfully and humanely deport the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally, Republican presidential contender Donald Trump often touts the efforts of the Eisenhower administration in the 1950s.
He did so again during the Republican debate on Nov. 10, saying "you don\'t get nicer, you don\'t get friendlier" than President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The 1954 initiative was aimed at apprehending and deporting agricultural workers who had crossed the border illegally looking for work.
According to a summary of the project from the Texas State Historical Association, the United States Border Patrol "aided by municipal, county, state, and federal authorities, as well as the military, began a quasi-military operation of search and seizure of all unauthorized immigrants."
The project, Ngai said, began with 750 immigration officers and border control agents, who used jeeps, trucks, buses and airplanes to apprehend migrants nationwide, including in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.
They apprehended 3,000 people a day and 170,000 during its first three months.
Many of the apprehended migrants were transported in crowded buses and dumped on the other side of the border in a manner that some at the time equated with the treatment of livestock.
In one incident, Ngai said, 88 apprehended Mexicans died of sunstroke after being subjected to 112-degree heat.
Trump has yet to lay out precisely how he would track down those living in the country illegally, or how he would determine who are "the good ones" that he would allow to return.

At one point, a group of prisoners rioted on a ship sending them back to Mexico.
However, Trump praised the Eisenhower-era deportation program during the Republican debate on Nov. 10.
Hundreds of thousands of farmworkers did enter the country legally under the guest-worker program.
His numbers included those who chose to leave the country voluntarily as well as people who returned after being deported and were sent away again.

Along the way, he stopped to accept a pain pill from one nurse and a high-five from another.
Both legs had been removed by an overworked Syrian doctor in a cellar.
It has been praised as a triumph of humanitarianism over politics.
The 9-year-old boy is one of 17 Syrians being treated at Rebecca Sieff Hospital in Safed, a mountain outpost in northern Israel.
The kids hung on him as he talked, grabbing at his big hands.
In that conflict, Syria tried, but failed to take back the Golan Heights.
This territory had been lost to Israel six years earlier.

In Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said there was no reason for Russia to invade Ukraine and warned that "we are on the brink of disaster."
Russia has long wanted to reclaim the lush Crimean peninsula, which was part of Russia until 1954.
He also said he had ordered stepped-up security at nuclear power plants, airports and other strategic infrastructure.
Ukraine is not a NATO member, meaning the U.S. and Europe are not obligated to come to its defense.
Kerry said he spoke with foreign ministers for G-8 and other nations on Saturday, and says everyone is prepared \'to go to the hilt" to isolate Russia.
The new Ukrainian government came to power last week following months of pro-democracy protests against a pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, and his decision to turn Ukraine toward Russia instead of the European Union.
Since then, tensions have risen sharply between the two capitals.

The largest animals to ever walk the Earth were the long-necked, long-tailed dinosaurs known as the sauropods, and the most famous of these giants is probably Brontosaurus, the "thunder lizard."
"Generally, Brontosaurus can be distinguished from Apatosaurus most easily by its neck, which is higher and less wide," says lead study author Emanuel Tschopp, a vertebrate paleontologist at the New University of Lisbon in Portugal.
"We\'re delighted that Brontosaurus is back," says Jacques Gauthier, curator of vertebrate paleontology and vertebrate zoology at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, who did not participate in this study.
This diversity of sauropods emphasizes "that the Late Jurassic of North America in which they lived may have been a weird time," Wedel says.
In other words, research that helped resurrect Brontosaurus may have birthed new mysteries as well.

Mary Fallin has a cabinet-level secretary dedicated to attracting drone companies to the state.
"This bill will harm any opportunity Maine has to create new jobs in the aerospace industry," LePage wrote after vetoing a bill limiting law enforcement use of drones.
A model drone policy from the Aerospace States Association, the Council of State Governments and the National Conference of State Legislatures urges states to require a warrant for drone surveillance of an individual; prohibit the re-use of video or photos collected by a drone for other investigations; and ban weapons from domestic drones.
"It is the wrong message to send if we want these jobs."
Congress has directed the FAA to safely add unmanned aircraft into the national airspace by 2015.
He told a TV news show on Sunday that Amazon hopes to use drones to make same-day deliveries within five years of FAA approval.

But Marion reached a breaking point on Saturday, when a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, during a confrontation in a gated community.
But he is far from alone in calling for a boycott of the Sunshine State to pressure Florida business leaders, particularly in the influential tourism industry, to lean on state lawmakers to repeal the controversial self-defense law.
Englewood has just one active contract with a Florida-based company, which was hired in May to compile an online registry of vacant properties, City Manager Timothy Dacey said.
Gerald Marion has spent his career fighting fires, not racial injustice.
Singer Stevie Wonder said he would no longer perform in Florida or other states with stand-your-ground laws.

Yukie Hashimoto and her husband sent their daughter 200 miles away, to the picturesque ski town of Matsumoto.
The mayor there had offered to take in and educate young people living in the shadow of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant.
That may have had nothing to do with radiation, but it made Hashimoto decide to get her out, and her husband relented.
Last Friday, she looked very much at home as she sat in the gymnasium decorated with flowers at Aida Junior High School for a school opening ceremony.
The Hashimoto family took some time to make their decision.
What we do know is that the cases of cancer are up, and so naturally we are worried," said Hiroshi Ueki, a former Fukushima resident who moved with his wife and two children and now oversees the Matsumoto project.
"The air feels so clean here," Kamiyama said.
She was in constant tears for the first few days, but by Friday she said she had made lots of great friends.
For those outside the largely off-limits 12-mile zone, taking such an extreme step is relatively rare.

"This case has never been about race... (or) about the right to bear arms," she said.
In a case that touched off a national debate on race and guns, George Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager killed during a confrontation on a rainy night in Florida last year.
He maintained that he shot Martin in self-defense when the teenager attacked him.
Prosecutors argued that he had profiled and stalked Martin, 17, who was returning from a convenience store after buying Skittles and a soft drink.
"We are very, very, very saddened, but we accept the jury\'s verdict in this case," Daryl Parks, one of the attorneys representing the Martin family, told reporters later.
He said Sybrina Fulton, Martin\'s mother, and Tracy Martin, his father, "are just heartbroken."
"Obviously, this is a tragedy," President Barack Obama said on March 23, 2012.
Questions about race have been part of the case from the beginning and continued to the end.

Perhaps the intent is to use these rules of movement to design more agile robots, said Jack Costello, a marine biologist at Providence College in Rhode Island.
It swims by moving the fin attached to its underside in a wave-like motion.
The scientists studied 22 very different species of finned swimmers using video recordings, lab studies and computer modeling to determine what pattern, if any, might exist.
"We found in every animal for which data are available, our prediction was correct," Neelesh Patanka said.
The findings could help scientists learn how to better build underwater robots that swim quickly and efficiently, the researchers added.
As it moved, each animal seemed to follow a specific pattern: the ratio between the length of each rippling wavelength and the height of each wavelength was about 20 to 1.
For each species they studied, including skates, rays, the black ghost knifefish, the cuttlefish and the Persian carpet flatworm \u2014 that ratio remained 20 to 1.
There could be a thousand more finned-swimming species that have the same ratio, the authors said.
"There\'s only a certain number of ways in which animals can move effectively," MacIver pointed out.
If those alien animals were moving through liquid water on another planet, then the same fluid limitations apply.
What if finned swimming animals were to develop in the oceans of an alien world?
New research says they would probably look a lot like the ones on Earth.
The scientists think this shows an unexpected case of convergent evolution.
The study was published in the scientific journal PLOS Biology.
These fish sweep a tail, and the rear portion of their bodies, back and forth.
Some creatures have a single fin running along the length of their bodies.
Such skills are critical, for example, when sending underwater vehicles to deal with oil spills.

It is just one of the hundreds of venues across Mexico where the government is handing out 10 million free digital television sets to the poor.
Mexicans are eligible to receive free TVs if they take part in one of several government social service programs.
These include Prospera, the national crusade against hunger, and Liconsa, which makes milk more affordable.
The massive operation requires fleets of trucks to deliver the sets and masses of workers.
To ensure that each family gets only one TV, workers must check documents, take fingerprints and scan the bar codes of the sets \u2014 and they must do it all very quickly.

While illicit border crossings in this southern Arizona corridor have plummeted, deaths are at an all-time high.
Shortly after, the group unveiled a humanitarian aid office, which now sits on the main drag of this rural town of 600 residents that is surrounded by cattle ranches.
The center is believed to be one of the first of its kind along the border, said Leesa Jacobson, a founding member of the group and a librarian in town.
"They all want rides to Tucson, and I say, \'No, no I cannot do that.\'
In 2005, Arivaca became a focal point for U.S. immigration policy as tensions between aid groups and Border Patrol agents reached a peak.
The worsening situation led some Arivaca residents to band together last year to form People Helping People, a group that provides aid to border crossers in the area.
The center is believed to be one of the first of its kind along the border, said Leesa Jacobson, a founding member of the group and a librarian in town.

Lugging groceries and supplies to the astronauts on the International Space Station may not be as cool as ferrying the astronauts themselves into orbit.
Some members of Congress and others criticized the decision, saying that private industry could not be trusted with such high-stakes work and that the business of spaceflight should be left to NASA.
On a recent trip to Silicon Valley, Eric Stallmer, the president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, said many other investors had a palpable fear-of-missing-out vibe.
A lot of people were saying this is wrong; NASA has to have its own rocket."
Last year, NASA awarded contracts to SpaceX and Boeing, worth a total of $6.8 billion, to take astronauts to the space station.
Now, in the coming months, it is expected to award another contract for cargo resupply, which could also be worth billions.
Its CST-100 capsule, originally designed for astronauts, could be easily reconfigured to handle cargo, said John Mulholland, a Boeing vice president in its space programs.
The world\'s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin, is in as well, promising to unveil "an innovative, reliable solution" at an invitation-only cocktail reception at Washington\'s Union Station this week.
Lockheed makes the Orion space capsule, which late last year NASA launched on a historic mission, sending the unmanned spacecraft farther than any human-rated vehicle had gone in 40 years.
Still, NASA has invested more than $363 million in its Dream Chaser space plane, which looks like a miniature version of the space shuttle and can land on commercial runways.
It\'s an entirely different approach than the other companies\' offerings, which is in part why it "can\'t be counted out," said Caceres, the space analyst.

Hot dogs, even the non-pork variety, are rare in Afghanistan.
So it was particularly unusual when five vehicles painted to look like giant frankfurters \u2014 with bright yellow mustard zigzags instead of racing stripes \u2014 popped up on the streets of the capital city this year.
Naveed Noori, a 25-year-old IT worker and university student, introduced Afghanistan to food trucks after studying the trend online and in Toronto, where his wife and baby daughter live.
The hot-dog-on-wheels, with a yellowish sesame-seed bun for a roof, stood out in a sea of drab sedans, sagging minibuses, carts pulled by the striving poor and gleaming SUVs belonging to the very rich.
The truck driver, who doubles as cook, had donned a hair net and plastic gloves and was grilling burgers as smoke billowed from an exhaust fitted to the roof.
Bolani, a potato-stuffed flatbread served with yogurt sauce, is a cheap and popular street snack.
Metal trash cans are affixed to each truck to discourage patrons from adding to the garbage that clogs roadside sewers.
Custom-printed menus, napkins and other paper goods are also transported overland from Pakistan, as are the halal chicken hot dogs.
The rest of the food, including more than 3,000 chicken patties and 7,000 samosas each week, is cooked at their rented offices, a small bungalow with a second-story kitchen overlooking a courtyard where the trucks are parked overnight.
For now, Noori said, they sell about $450 in food every day, enough to turn a small monthly profit but far from recovering their initial investment.
"We have to explain to them every day what we are doing," said Shuja, who is in his 30s, clad in a blue company polo shirt.
City traffic police allow the trucks to park in certain areas, but Noori said attempts to get official permits were delayed by the recent presidential election crisis, which paralyzed government agencies for months.

After his father was diagnosed with cancer, a 15-year-old Champaign, Ill., teen started skipping school, erupting in angry outbursts, yelling at teachers and punching holes in walls or retreating to his room paralyzed by an overwhelming sadness.
As stories about increasing school violence dominate headlines, experts say many teens are struggling with untreated mental illness.
An Associated Press review of policies around the nation shows screenings vary widely not only from state to state, but within each school district.
"I think it is a good idea because a lot of people think they don\'t need help but they actually do," said the teen, who is not being identified by The Associated Press because he is a minor.
"No state is providing high-end services in all of their schools," said Sharon Stephan, co-director of the Center for School Mental Health, a national organization based at the University of Maryland that provides training for schools and mental health providers.

"They were system disks, not personal copy disks with something handwritten on them like \'Andy Warhol\'s images\' on them."
It turned out the disks, as well as the computer they were created on, were beta versions of both, which made accessing the systems that much more difficult.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/venus.jpg"  />PITTSBURGH \u2014 High-tech sleuthing by a group of students uncovered previously unknown digital images by pop artist Andy Warhol.
Just the possibility that something \u2014 anything \u2014 new by the King of Pop Art had been discovered was enough to excite Warhol fanatics around the world.
The 28 images were apparently created and stored by Warhol on nearly-unreadable computer disks on his Commodore Amiga computer almost 30 years ago.
Also found on the disk were versions of some of his other most iconic artworks such as a banana and actress Marilyn Monroe.
A man who worked with the now-closed Amiga World magazine called after reading a story about the discovery Thursday.
The magazine did a story in 1986 about Warhol and his use of the Amiga computer.
But even if Warhol had help in making the images, they will still help experts understand the artist.

"We were not optimistic when we first saw the floppy disks," said Keith Bare, a Carnegie Mellon graduate who was involved in the project.
"But I think we\'re going to have a lot of this in the future unless we start saving files in very standard file formats," said Michael Dile, who was deeply involved in the project.
People might think that new computer images by Warhol could be sold by the museum for a lot of money.
The museum might not even be able to use the Marilyn Monroe image found on the computer, for example, he said.

Through 13 years of teaching, Jennifer Kavanaugh never dreamed of hitting a child \u2014 not even once.
Should it be used, the local board of education must determine how it will be used and whether a parent will be notified or can opt for a different form of discipline.
District officials believe there are better ways \u2014 ranging from parent-teacher conferences to suspension or expulsion \u2014 to discipline a child, district spokeswoman Jana Shortt said.
For the 2009-2010 school year, about 184,500 students were physically punished, compared with about 223,000 in the 2005-2006 school year, according to the department.
"I do not support corporal punishment, but my parents sent me to a faith-based school \u2026 I\'m opposed to government interfering in the curriculum."
The department does not keep track of which districts in the state use corporal punishment.
The Senate Committee on Progress and Development unanimously passed the bill Wednesday afternoon.
"At some point, we may need some compromise when some folks come and talk to us.
Right now, I haven\'t heard any opposition."
Missouri is one of 19 states that still allows corporal punishment in schools.

District officials believe there are better ways to react to bad behavior, district spokeswoman Jana Shortt said.
In the early 2000s, however, it changed its policy, said district official Lorenzo Rizzi.
The move away from corporal punishment is happening nationwide.
The Fox School District in Jefferson County used to allow spanking in its schools.
She never used corporal punishment herself \u2014 but she knows there are teachers across the state who do.
The latest states to outlaw it were New Mexico in 2011 and Ohio in 2009..
About 4,200 students across the state were physically punished in the 2009-2010 school year.
Corporal punishment "doesn\'t change behavior," he said.
The move away from corporal punishment is happening across the country.
Walsh attended a Catholic school as a child.
"I do not support corporal punishment, but my parents sent me to a faith-based school \u2026 I\'m opposed to government" telling such schools what they will teach, she said.
Nonetheless, she thinks there could be a problem when it comes to private schools.
"I suspect we\'ll hear from people who don\'t want" the state interfering "in private schools," Justus said.
Right now, I haven\'t heard" from anyone who\'s against it.

Scientists are still trying to figure out how readily the brain recovers from injury.
Those effects might also not show up until later.
The American Medical Association voted Tuesday to declare obesity a disease, a move that effectively defines 78 million American adults and 12 million children as having a medical condition requiring treatment.
As such, it should encourage primary care physicians to get over their discomfort about raising weight concerns with obese patients.
Past AMA documents have referred to obesity as an "urgent chronic condition," a "major health concern" and a "complex disorder."
The American Medical Association voted Tuesday to declare obesity a disease, a move that effectively defines 78 million American adults and 12 million children as having a medical condition requiring treatment.
"This will force primary care physicians to address it, even if we don\'t have a cure for it."
Almost 36 percent of adults and 12 percent of children in the United States are obese, or greatly overweight.
They argued whether the action would do more to help overweight patients get treatment,  or would add more shame to the complex condition.
"Primary care physicians tend to look at obesity as a behavior problem," said Dr. Rexford Ahima of the University of Pennsylvania.
That figure could rise by an additional $550 billion over the next 20 years, Duke University found.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved just two new prescription weight-loss medications since 1999.
The AMA does not want these to overshadow other measures like healthy diets and regular exercise.
The move affects 78 million American adults and 12 million children.
Studies have found that more than half of obese patients have never been told by a doctor that they need to lose weight.
So are one-tenth of children.
More than half of obese patients have never been told by a doctor they need to lose weight, studies show.
The new disease label is more urgent and serious.
Doctors "tend to look at obesity as a behavior problem," said Dr. Rexford Ahima of the University of Pennsylvania.
All those extra pounds have caused a lot of expensive health problems.
The government has approved just two new weight-loss medications since 1999.
Still, he worried that the term disease may make people feel ashamed.

Thanks in part to high-profile appeals by celebs such as will.i.am, Sean Penn, and Shakira, 73 percent of all donors to Haiti relief were younger than 50, according to a Pew survey.
Not bad as a generation often portrayed as self-absorbed and out of touch.
They tended to give less money at a shot (mostly $100 or less) than older groups, but they gave more quickly.
Part of this is that YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media are global.
Millennials, he says, use two main filters for their philanthropic decisions: "big, vivid images and calls to action on TV \u2014 and their network of friends."
But phones, even websites, seem _ slow.
As of Thursday, the Red Cross had reported it had collected $11 million in donations and pledges in its Philippines relief fund.
Much depends on whether relief groups can bring the crisis alive \u2014 and whether millennials, and the rest of the mobile, social world, respond.

Student Jasmine Singh always planned to major in computer science.
When she entered UW, the computer science department paired her with a female upperclassman majoring in the field.
The women who took the class "discovered they loved computer science and were great at it," Lazowska said in an email.
However, the program at UW is growing, in part because of additional money being offered by the Washington state government.
He fears this strategy is reducing the diversity of computer science students.
"Our data, and common sense, suggest that the people you\'re going to weed out are precisely the people who are already underrepresented," he said.

"I think the glorified violence is really the Achilles heel for the NHL," said Charles "Bucky" Zimmerman, an attorney at Zimmerman Reed that filed the lawsuit on behalf of the players.
Zimmerman also worked on the football litigation, which resulted in the NFL agreeing to pay a $765 million settlement to thousands of former players.
One argument that tries to separate the NFL litigation from the NHL case is that by engaging in fighting, players willfully take on the health risks that could come from that.
"And the point is that the fighting arena would not exist and would be outlawed as it is in every other level of the game had the NHL not condoned it and sold tickets based upon it and promoted the sport in that way.
If they would outlaw fighting, there wouldn\'t be people who would fight."
Zimmerman said he thinks more players will join the litigation much in the same way the group of plaintiffs in the NFL case exponentially grew as it progressed.

"I think the glorified violence is really the Achilles heel for the NHL," said Charles "Bucky" Zimmerman, an attorney at Zimmerman Reed that filed the lawsuit on behalf of the players.
"It\'s the nature of these types of cases that once one is filed, a number of similarly styled cases follow.
"There\'s knowledge, we believe, that these type of concussive injuries were known and protections were not put in place appropriately enough and fast enough and rules changes were not implemented even today in fighting.
It\'s now become more important that we talk about it and do something about it rather than just benignly let it continue into the future."
They claim the league has promoted fighting and downplayed the risk of head injuries that come from it.

A University of Kansas researcher has discovered what is believed to be the only audio recording of basketball inventor James Naismith, during which he describes the first game he organized 124 years ago this month as a bit of a disaster.
It was part of a radio show from New York station WOR-AM called "We the People."
Naismith said he had been given two weeks to devise a new indoor activity for his gym class.
The work was hurried along by what he described as a "real New England blizzard" that had the youngsters climbing the walls with little to do.
"What we know is there was the first game, then there was a second game with the full complement of rules," Zogry said.
Rob Rains, the author of "James Naismith: The Man Who Invented Basketball," co-written with Naismith\'s granddaughter Hellen Carpenter, said he didn\'t know any other audio recording of Naismith.
The University of Kansas, where Naismith worked for 40 years and was the first basketball coach, has obtained the 13 original rules and is building a structure to house them.

Figure out which genes matter and then use the fast growing field of genetic engineering to edit the DNA of a closely related species into some version of the extinct species.
So far, 32 samples have had the genetic code in their mitochondria sequenced.
"All of our birds are all very, very similar to each other \u2014 like everybody being cousins, essentially \u2014 which is the effect of this recent rapid population expansion," Novak adds.
To figure out when the last boom occurred will require finding DNA from fossil samples thousands of years old \u2014 a few of which Novak has begun to examine.
"Nothing in the data so far to shout at us to turn back now and not bring back the passenger pigeon," Novak says.
The last lonely bird of a species that once numbered 3 billion or more died on Sept. 1, 1914.
If the de-extinction works, the only remaining challenge would be to teach the new birds how to be passenger pigeons.

The once-bustling oyster farm and sales shack at the end of the dirt road had the look of sudden abandonment.
The park service prevailed \u2014 after spending millions of dollars in scores of lawsuits that ended at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The weight of the water-logged wood is estimated at 375 tons, and exhuming it will likely require a powerful hoist.
Already a crew on the water was removing the vestiges of the oyster and clam operation.
Commercial farmers have been cultivating oysters from the Estero in earnest since the 1960s.
The settlement also allowed the dozen or so former employees who live on the site in two small homes and three trailers to stay for at least three months while a government contractor attempts to find suitable housing for them.
The expense of restoring the Estero itself will also be significant.

Five years later, Ta was on a plane to Richmond, Virginia, helped by a little-known resettlement effort called the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) program, which is operated by the U.S. government with help from states and local charities.
Now some see URM as a way to help some of the unaccompanied Central American children who have been surging across the U.S. border with Mexico.
In fiscal year 2014, 44,000 children crossed the border alone, compared with fewer than 4,000 in 2011.
The situations are pretty horrific."
Two private agencies, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, both of which have experience in dealing with refugees, also supply caseworkers and care-giving help.
In fiscal year 2013, there were 1,850 children in the program, according to an agency report, up from 1,409 in 2011.
The way to determine refugee status, and eligibility for URM, is to investigate the circumstances of their lives back home.
President Barack Obama earlier this year opened the door for the children to be treated as refugees when he said that some of the Central American children might apply under "narrow circumstances."
Obama also noted that it is better for people to apply for refugee status in their home countries before making the trip to America.
"In the case of genuine refugees, these services are very appropriate," said Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit research organization that generally advocates tighter immigration policies.
In nearly 35 years, the program has helped some 13,000 children from Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America to escape from war, persecution and natural disasters.
Now some see URM as a way to help some of the unaccompanied Central American children who have been surging across the U.S. border with Mexico.
Fourteen states and the District of Columbia administer their own URM programs.
The federal requirements are a high bar for many of the Central American children, and identifying those who might be without family entirely is even more challenging, said Kristyn Peck of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.

Some argue that labeling the Central American children as refugees would be the surest way to get them the help and care they need.
Haynes says that both the Central American children and groups of children from other parts of the world that have used URM in the past face the same kinds of difficulties.

The United Nations has argued that the Central American children are refugees who should be able to move to safety in other countries.
Some have been victims of violence, kidnapping or other crimes.
The U.S. government disagrees and does not consider the children to be refugees.
Getting that label would help the incoming children use the URM program to settle in the United States.
It is unclear whether the program could be expanded to help many of the Central American kids if they were considered to be refugees.
Some argue that labeling the Central American children refugees would be the surest way to get them the help they need.
In 2011 there were 1,409 children in the program, but by 2013 there were 1,850.

They have even gone so far as to suggest, using junk science statistics prevalent among climate change deniers, that vegetarians contribute more to greenhouse gas emissions than meat eaters.
The theory is that meat, especially beef, is disproportionately responsible for greenhouse gas emissions and if we were able to change how people eat, primarily in wealthier countries like the U.S., we could take a significant bite out of climate change.
Yet it advises governments to push for the taxes through publicly funded public relations campaigns which make the matter appear clear-cut, because "publics respond best to simple messages."
The idea that reducing meat consumption would make both humans and the Earth healthier is challenged by consideration of the environmental impact of alternatives.
Of course, replacing lettuce for meat and comparing emissions on a calorie-for-calorie basis is absurd.
The report explains, "these perhaps counterintuitive results are primarily due to USDA recommendations for greater caloric intake of fruits, vegetables, dairy and fish/seafood, which have relatively high resource use and emissions per calorie."
The lesson: if you want to advocate for meat taxes, follow the advice of the experts and keep it simple.
Unless rapidly increasing meat consumption around the world is curtailed, grazing livestock will continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and further degrade the environment.

"Politicians ignored it," said Monika Steinhauser, head of the local branch of the Refugee Council, which works closely with municipal authorities.
But that swift proficiency can carry a pitfall of its own, familiar to immigrant families everywhere: Sometimes even very small children find themselves the "managers" of their family, helping to navigate tasks such as doctors\' visits or filling out paperwork, according to refugee advocates.

Opening a new military front in the Middle East, President Barack Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes inside Syria for the first time Wednesday night, along with expanded strikes in Iraq as part of "a steady, relentless effort" to root out the militant group Islamic State and its spreading reign of terror.
Obama insisted that his plan to "degrade and ultimately destroy" the Islamic State militants would not involve returning U.S. combat troops to the Middle East.
While administration officials have said they are not aware of a credible threat of a potential attack by the militants in the U.S., they say the group poses risks to Americans and interests across the Middle East.
Officials are also concerned about the prospect that Westerners, including Americans, who have joined the militant group could return to their home countries to launch attacks.
In recent weeks, the militants have released videos depicting the beheading of two American journalists in Syria.
Officials said Obama plans to proceed with both the broader airstrikes in Iraq and the strikes in Syria without seeking new authorization from Congress.
Instead, he is to act under a use-of-force authorization Congress passed in the days after 9/11 to give President George W. Bush the ability to go after those who perpetrated the terror attacks.
Obama said his approach in Syria is modeled after those long-running U.S. counterterrorism campaigns.
House Speaker John Boehner, Republican from Ohio, praised Obama for acknowledging the "grave and growing threat" that Islamic extremists pose, but he said Obama was coming to that conclusion far too late.
Even before his remarks, congressional leaders were grappling with whether to support that request and if so, how to get such a measure through the fractured legislature before the November elections.
The White House announced Wednesday that it was also providing $25 million in immediate military assistance to the Iraqi government as part of efforts to combat the Islamic State.
The U.S. has been pressing allies in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere to help with efforts to degrade the terror group.

The Disney restrictions have been in place since 2003, thanks to a provision quietly slipped into a massive congressional spending bill weeks before the Iraq war.
The restrictions effectively ended a war between Disney and aerial advertisers who had buzzed over the parks for years before the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
An FAA spokeswoman said last week that the agency also would like to take a closer look at no-fly zones over sporting events, which were made permanent by the 2003 law.
"Banner towers used to make money with their banner tows around Disneyland; now they\'re not allowed to.
... People can\'t take aerial photography shots," said Mark Skinner, owner of Anaheim Helicopters.
According to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, nearly 100 aerial advertising firms went out of business after Congress codified the no-fly zones over the Disney parks and sporting events.
In response, government attorneys mounted a strident defense of the Disney no-fly zones, saying attackers could plow planes into crowds of tourists, drop bombs on them, or spray them with chemical or biological agents.
I would say, today, that the case for protecting Disney is even weaker than it was when we argued those cases," Crampton said.
Yet there is nothing temporary about the restrictions over the Disney properties.

In response, government attorneys defended the Disney no-fly zones.
"I would say, today, that the case for protecting Disney is even weaker than it was when we argued those cases," Crampton said.
Defense and anti-terror officials did not appear to ask for the Disney protections.
Richard W. Bloom is the director of terrorism, intelligence and security studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona.
"I would say, today, that the case for protecting Disney is even weaker than it was when we argued those cases," Crampton said.
Since the no-fly zones began, there have been no major terror attacks, Crampton pointed out.
Yet there is nothing temporary about the restriction over the Disney parks.
The Disney no-fly zones have been in place since 2003.
Defenders of the zones have said the Disney parks deserve special protection.
Richard W. Bloom is director of terrorism, intelligence and security studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona.
However, he called them one of many layers of security designed to protect American airspace.
Since the no fly zones began, there have been no major terror attacks, Crampton pointed out.
"I would say, today, that the case for protecting Disney is even weaker than it was when we argued those cases," he said.
They are in effect for Disneyland in California and Walt Disney World in Florida.
Since the no fly zones began, there have been no major terror attacks, Crampton pointed out.
The pilots could be questioned and arrested.
He said the no-fly zones were not perfect.
The law creating the no-fly zones was passed by Congress after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
Steve Crampton is the lawyer who fought the Disney no-fly zone.
When they applied for the program in August 2013, the couple agreed that they would either go to Mars together or neither of them would go.
Dr. Kraft asked Smith-Velazquez whether she would come back from Mars, if that were possible, and why.
She quickly answered with a firm no, "because the people you go with become your family."
Smith-Velazquez suggested that her Cherokee background and ability to get along with others might also have helped her to stand out.
You need spaceships," said John M. Logsdon, a professor at George Washington University who studies space policy.
A study by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that Mars One needs to reconsider some elements of its plans to keep settlers alive.
Mars One admits that the mission is an incredibly ambitious undertaking that will require constant efforts to prevent delays and failures.
Mars One estimates it will cost $6 billion just to get its first crew to Mars, though the MIT report suggested it likely will be higher.
So far, Mars One has struggled to find financial support.

The workshop leaders came laden with markers in colors other than red and blue (gang colors), drafting rulers crafted from museum board (too dull to double as weapons) and kiddie scissors (ditto).
"I feel an extra sense of purpose today," Paschall had told his fellow classmates as the workshop got underway.
Soon after, she heard the founder of Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth speak about transformations at a West Oakland middle school, where suspensions and expulsions of African-American students had plummeted.
They teamed and VanBuren designed her first stand-alone restorative justice room \u2014 in a portable trailer at an Oakland high school.
The men were defensive, reluctant to share their feelings.
Deandre Hill, 27, convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, and Christopher Gillis, 44, facing murder and commercial burglary charges, sat side by side.
They envisioned a cell with a computer that allowed for communication with family.
"The most important thing is to be accountable, but in order to work on yourself you have to be comfortable," said Gillis, who is planning a restorative justice circle to "make up for the harm" he had inflicted on his 16-year-old son through his absence and violent tendencies.
As his teammates stood beside him, Dante Hayes, 33, facing charges of burglary and burglary to commit rape, showed a design with a tree in the atrium representing growth and "the ability for us to grow."

In a closing circle after the presentation, Pratt, who recently participated in a restorative justice-style circle with his girlfriend, said his whole outlook had changed: "Instead of being barbarians and just beating each other upside the head, we can be like family."
The workshop leaders came laden with markers in colors other than red and blue (gang colors), drafting rulers crafted from museum board (too dull to double as weapons) and kiddie scissors (ditto).

Parents in Charlotte, North Carolina, celebrated this month when their county commissioners approved a budget that includes $1.8 million to make sure every public school has a full-time nurse.
The agreement capped two years of work by a parents advocacy group started by Teri Saurer, the mother of daughters who just finished first and third grades.
"You want to know that if something happened to your child \u2014 they\'re at school so many hours of the day \u2014 that there\'s going to be somebody with medical training who can attend to them," Saurer said.
Members of the group attended the county commission meetings wearing bright orange T-shirts emblazoned with the message "Healthy children learn better.
Advocates for more education funding in Philadelphia are calling for enough money to restore nurses, teachers and other school staffers whose positions have been cut.
They also treat injuries and counsel students about physical and emotional issues.
U.S. school staffing surveys from the Department of Education show 81,410 full-time and part-time nurses in all U.S. schools in 2011-12, the latest year available.

Parents in Charlotte, North Carolina, are celebrating because every public school will have its own nurse this fall.
Members of the group attended the county government meetings wearing bright orange T-shirts.
The shirts read: "Healthy children learn better.
Also many school nurses who retire are replaced with aides or nurses with less training, said Erin Maughan.
This means that one nurse will be responsible for several schools.
So they rely on secretaries and other school staff members, "even teachers and principals, to step in and do the daily duties a school nurse would do," Maughan said.
This fall, because of the extra money to pay for more school nurses, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will have one nurse for every 900 students, Saurer said.
This fall, every public school there will have its own nurse.

About one out of every three schools had nurses who were only there part of the time.
Toy-related injuries involving American children have jumped about 40 percent since 1990, according to a new analysis of hospital data.
With about 3 billion model planes, hula hoops, building block sets and other toys sold in the U.S. every year, "the importance of toys in society cannot be underestimated," the researchers wrote.
Most of the time, kids emerge unscathed from their play sessions.
Scooters helped make falls and collisions the most common types of toy-related injuries, accounting for 46 percent and 22 percent of the total, respectively.

They found that the age kids were most likely to be hurt while playing with toys was age 2.
Scooters also helped make falls and crashes the most common types of accidents linked with toys.
The scientists who did the study felt that there would be a lower number of accidents if more attention was paid to making toys safer.
The number of American children getting hurt by their toys is growing.
For example: Four out of five toy-related injuries happened at home.
More than half of the kids who got hurt were under 5 years old.

Sebastien de la Cruz hit all the right notes when he sang the "Star Spangled Banner" last week at Game 3 of the National Basketball Association Finals in San Antonio, but his performance was followed by a sour, racism-tinged tempest on social media.
Some people did not like the idea of Sebastien singing the anthem, especially not in the Mexican folk music garb, and they took to social-media site Twitter to let their feelings be known.
More than 55 percent of the population is Hispanic and 90 percent of those people identify themselves as Mexican, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.
The Hispanic population in the United States grew 2.2 percent in 2012 to about 58 million people and represent about 17 percent of the country, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, making Hispanics the second-largest demographic group in the country behind whites.
Firefighter Andrew Lacey in Georgia probably got more attention than he wanted when he tweeted, "How you singing the anthem lookin like an illegal immigrant," as the _Augusta Chronicle_ newspaper in Georgia reported.

Amr Zaidah, a 26-year-old college graduate from Syria, knew exactly what to do and where to go.
Zaidah, with the aid of GPS, helped pilot the inflatable boat that brought him and about 30 more migrants near the village of Molivos on Lesbos.
"I have researched our journey for more than two months," said Zaidah, a native of the Syrian city of Aleppo who had lived in Turkey for the last two years.
Zaidah and his group already know which border points they will cross, hotels they can stay in and stores where they can get clothes for the fall weather as they head north.
Zaidah and his friends headed straight to Molivos for the free bus rides.
Many others set off on the journey to Mytilene on foot under the summer heat and humidity.
They line up outside the offices of cellphone providers at Mytilene and buy Greek numbers that allow data and roaming elsewhere in Europe so they can connect to Facebook and the apps they use to communicate.
Landing in Lesbos, chanting, "Thanks be to God," the first thing they do is fish their phones out, joyously hug and take group selfies on the shore.
Then with the Turkish signal still strong here, they call loved ones back in Turkey, Syria or Iraq, shouting, "We arrived in Greece!"
After nearly 12 hours, they stumbled on a departure area \u2014 only to discover it was run by a rival smuggler.
"He pointed it at my head and said, \'I can kill you now and no one will know, or I can call my coast guard friends who will alert the police to your group and come and arrest you.\'"
All along the route, impromptu businesses have started up.
In Lesbos, signs in Arabic have gone up on storefronts.
For a while, some Syrians and Iraqis sold forged versions of the documents that all the migrants need to get.
But they were put out of business when Greek authorities sped up the process for issuing the real documents, which are free.
Lesbos residents have found another way to profit.
Some wait on the coast with binoculars, and as soon as a boat lands, they swoop down in a pickup truck and look for things for sale.
"I used social media networks to look into where to go, who is the best smuggler to hire and what stuff we needed for the trip," he said.
On one Facebook group, for example, Syrians and others who already made the trip share the names and telephone numbers of good smugglers in Turkey.
The social media-savvy among the migrants are constantly on their phones.
During the sea journey, which can take up to two hours in good weather, they keep their phones in plastic bags to keep them dry.
Then with the Turkish signal still strong here, they call loved ones back in Turkey, Syria or Iraq, shouting, "We arrived in Greece!"
The group finally connected with their own smuggler.
At dawn, he made them carry heavy boxes down to the beach, where they had to assemble the boat themselves.

With nothing less at stake than the future of planet Earth, NASA has decided to crowdsource ideas to detect and track asteroids that have the potential to wipe out life as we know it.
"Good ideas can come from anywhere," said Ben Burress, a staff astronomer at Oakland\'s Chabot Space &amp; Science Center, which is not affiliated with NASA\'s Asteroid Grand Challenge.
With NASA out of the business of launching humans into space \u2014 and asteroid killer and action star Bruce Willis on the bench \u2014 "Earth\'s defense," as NASA calls it, is left in the hands of mere mortals.
"For the past three years, NASA has been learning and advancing the ability to leverage distributed algorithm and coding skills through the NASA Tournament Lab to solve tough problems," the lab\'s director, Jason Crusan, said in a statement.
Asked how long the entire Asteroid Grand Challenge will last, Ramsey said, "Until the problem\'s solved."
With nothing less at stake than the future of planet Earth, NASA has decided to crowdsource ideas to detect and track asteroids that have the potential to wipe out life as we know it.
Currently, NASA estimates that only 1 percent of the millions of asteroids hurtling around our solar system have been found.
The center uses the NASA Tournament Lab and its partner, the Harvard Business School, for its algorithmic and software development contests.

Asked how long the entire Asteroid Grand Challenge will last, Ramsey said, "Until the problem\'s solved."
NASA has decided to crowdsource, or ask the public for ideas to detect and track asteroids that have the potential to wipe out life as we know it.
In February 2013, a previously undetected, 65-foot-wide asteroid exploded over Russia, unleashing the force of 500,000 tons of TNT.
Afterward, NASA launched a series of contests for smart and talented people around the globe.
The hope is to defend Earth against any number of asteroids that could be bearing down on us right this instant.
"For the past three years, NASA has been learning and advancing the ability to leverage distributed algorithm and coding skills through the NASA Tournament Lab to solve tough problems," Jason Crusan said in a statement.
It hopes to be able to find and track asteroids, identify their size and shape and whether they represent threats to Earth.
Then NASA will come up with ways to prevent them from hitting and wiping out plants, animals and humans.
Asked how long the entire Asteroid Grand Challenge will last, Ramsey replied, "Until the problem\'s solved."

Growing up in a North Dallas neighborhood plagued by drugs and gangs, Jordan Henderson envisioned just two options for his future: end up in jail \u2014 or the graveyard.
With little to look forward to, the 18-year-old began to pursue short-term successes, getting involved in drugs and criminal activity.
"What that tells us is you can\'t just say all of these serious offenders are all bad and they\'re all going to be bad forever," said UTD criminologist Alex Piquero, who led the study.
"We can turn some of these kids around if we give them these opportunities and we give them these consistent messages."
"I thought to myself, this is the lifestyle that everybody before me shows, this is the lifestyle that everyone around me is doing and this is the lifestyle I have to choose.
For the first time in their lives, many feel a sense of approval and the joy that comes in living up to expectations.

The head of Cargill Inc., a massive U.S. agriculture company, never used the words "child labor" in the 30-minute keynote address he delivered earlier this month to the World Cocoa Foundation.
That term has become code for big cocoa players like Cargill that are trying to stop child labor abuses on cocoa farms while keeping production high.
But those efforts have fallen well short.
Cargill says solutions to child labor abuses lie in making cocoa farming more productive and profitable.
But given the scope of the child labor problem, more investments are needed, Harkin said.
Cargill\'s competitor Archer Daniels Midland said it does "actively develop, support and fund several programs to help eliminate the worst forms of child labor."
And Cargill should soon announce a three-year extension of that initiative.
But progress will continue to be "incremental," Terheijden cautioned, because Cargill\'s program "is based on empowering communities so they can take control of their own future."
One of the worst practices is trafficking children into the Ivory Coast from neighboring countries Burkina Faso and Mali, then forcing them to labor on cocoa farms.
Essentially, the Harkin-Engel Protocol failed in its goal of ending the worst forms of child labor by 2005.
The mixed results in the past decade call into question whether such goals can be met, Tulane concluded.
The head of Cargill Inc., a massive U.S. agriculture company, never used the words "child labor" in the 30-minute keynote address he delivered earlier this month to the World Cocoa Foundation.
Greg Page is CEO of Cargill Inc., a huge U.S. company that trades and produces foods including grains, livestock and cocoa.
These reports have dogged the cocoa industry for more than a decade.
There have been many corporate-backed attempts to cure the child labor problem.
But, "the companies that process cocoa, such as Cargill and ADM, have been less engaged," he said.
But progress will continue to be slow, Terheijden cautioned.
These features are difficult to capture with the naked eye, he said.
He also argues that the design of the tomb suggests it was built for a queen, rather than a king.
"Akhenaten\'s family is full of secrets and historical issues that have yet to be resolved," el-Damaty said.
Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said he will seek final approval to use radar to inspect the tomb, by bouncing radio waves off of any objects.
El-Damaty spoke while touring the burial sites of Tutankhamun, popularly known as King Tut, and other pharaohs in the famed Valley of the Kings.
The British expert recently speculated that Tutankhamun, who died at the age of 19, may have been hastily buried in an outer chamber of what was originally the tomb of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti.
These features are difficult to see with the naked eye, he said.
El-Damaty was visiting Luxor with Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves.
Tutankhamun was an ancient Egyptian king.
El-Damaty wants to look for the rooms.
Reeves said the walls may hide two secret doorways.

Like a flower shedding its petals, an aging star casts off its outer layers, surrounding itself with cloud-like shells of gas and dust that seed the universe with heavier elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.
Cataloging the different types of nebulae and studying their properties, the researchers began to notice something strange: More than half of the bipolar nebulae seemed to be aligned, even though they were separated by vast distances of many light-years amid the crowded galactic bulge.
Translation: The nebulae\'s shared alignment points to "a powerful magnetic pull 1/8in the galactic bulge 3/8 when they were formed," Rees said.
The findings could help "get confirmation in terms of the way the bipolar nebulae are formed, and provide some insight, possibly, on the way the bulge was formed," he said.
Only the magnetized nails will turn and point if you bring the magnet near, leaving the unmagnetized ones untouched.
It has long been known that the clouds of gas and dust, or nebulae, that dying stars cast off are strikingly colorful.
Like a flower shedding its petals, an aging star casts off its outer layers, surrounding itself with cloud-like shells of gas and dust.
The two researchers, lead author Bryan Rees and Albert Zijlstra, studied data from 130 nebulae.
It has long been known that the clouds of gas and dust, or nebulae, that dying stars cast off are strikingly colorful.
When ancient stars die, they give off colorful clouds of gas and dust, known as nebulae.
The discovery was made by two researchers from the University of Manchester.
Their findings help explain how the stars behind the nebulae formed.
And they can reveal whether a star is one of a pair of stars.
This is the galaxy that contains our own planet.
Something like that could have happened at the center of the Milky Way, astronomers say.
For more than a decade, increasing numbers of black women have been wearing their natural hair in Afros, braids, locks and twists.
Will my co-workers or family members accept me?"
"It doesn\'t matter if the fake hair is matted and cheap and braids (are) falling off.
What does that say about our self-esteem and self-worth?"
"Lupita\'s look is something I\'d never seen before (as a standard of beauty) in Hollywood," said Peterson.
Maybe by seeing someone who looks like her, she can feel more self-assured and brave."
On a recent afternoon, Ladon Brumfield asked a group of 9- and 10-year-old African-American girls to define beauty.
It was especially popular in the African-American community in the 1960s and 1970s.
Their hair type can range from straight to wavy to curly to kinky.
Not many of the 150,000 Allied soldiers who took part in D-Day are still alive today.
They stood, somber-faced and proud, alongside President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande and other world leaders.
"Our commitment to liberty, to equality, to freedom," to the "dignity of every human being," he said, "is written in blood on these beaches."
Their sacrifice helped bring Europe peace and unity.
It is where Americans come to honor U.S. soldiers killed in Normandy.
"I make them promise to bring their grandchildren," he said, "to serve as a bridge to the next generation."
Standing just 5-foot-3, Lauren Saiki was sometimes the smallest player on the basketball court.
The Asian leagues have been the starting point for many successful high school and now even college careers, particularly for young women.
Keppel has a strong basketball team, even though the average height of its players is usually about 5-foot-5.
There are other Japanese-American leagues \u2014 bowling, baseball, volleyball \u2014 but none of them are as popular as basketball.
On a Sunday morning in the spring, Claire Sugiyama was in the gym bleachers with about a dozen parents and grandparents to watch her daughter, Sarah, play with the Tigerettes Pulelehua sixth-grade team.
That confidence will be important for Saiki as she heads to West Virginia.

One clip, dated Wednesday, showed a woman driving in the traditional veil, with only her eyes showing.
One female activist said the publication of the video clips and photographs was the first part of a two-stage campaign designed to change attitudes.
"To drive with a license should not be against the law," the activist said.
Many Saudis, including senior officials, have become more open to the idea of women driving, she added.
Opponents of the ban say it means families have to employ expensive private drivers.
Not being able to drive also makes it difficult for women to work or carry out many other basic daily tasks.
They also point out that women in rural areas of Saudi Arabia frequently drive without being stopped by police.
In a show of support, some newspapers also published opinion pieces arguing that women should be allowed to drive.
"To drive with a license should not be against the law," the activist said.
Women who do get behind the wheel have been arrested.
They also point out that Saudi women living outside of cities frequently drive without being stopped by the police.
Scientists in Europe say they unearthed strong evidence that Neanderthals fashioned their own specialized bone tools.
The find adds to the accumulating evidence that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than previously thought, contrary to their brutish, club-lugging ape-men image.
The implements are the oldest specialized bone tools found in Europe, said study lead author Marie Soressi, an archaeologist from Leiden University in the Netherlands.
Before the finds, tools unearthed at Neanderthal sites were almost exclusively made of stone.
The timings suggests that Neanderthals might have figured out how to make the tools themselves, Soressi and her team wrote.
"I don\'t think that the image of the brutish or stupid Neanderthal is true anymore," said Paola Villa, a curator at the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History.
Team member and archaeologist William Rendu of the French National Center for Scientific Research noticed the unusual looking fragment of deer rib.
Further examination under a microscope revealed that the artifact, less than a centimeter long, had a worn edge and a polished surface.
To confirm that the tip came from a lissoir, the researchers road-tested the tools, fashioning their own lissoirs and scraping them against animal hides.
When they compared their replicas to the artifact under a microscope, the tools shared the same signs of wear: cracks radiating from the tip.
The group found three over the next seven years, and confirmed they too came from leather-working tools.
"We didn\'t expect to find these bones," said McPherron, a study co-author.
Radiocarbon dating put one of the lissoirs at 51,000 years ago \u2014 thousands of years before modern humans arrived in Europe.
The findings add to earlier evidence of complex behavior in Neanderthals.
Scientists in Europe say they unearthed strong evidence that Neanderthals fashioned their own specialized bone tools.

The ancient fragment was probably a tip that had broken off, she said.
McPherron and his coworkers began searching his site for lissoir fragments too.
Henry said most of the evidence suggested that Neanderthals adopted the technology from modern humans.
Scientists in Europe say they unearthed strong evidence that Neanderthals carved their own specialized bone tools.
Archaeologists said they discovered four fragments of bone tools known as lissoirs at two Neanderthal sites in southwestern France.
They described the findings in a study in a science magazine.
The implements are the oldest specialized bone tools found in Europe, said archaeologist Marie Soressi of The Netherlands.
But the recently unearthed lissoirs are about 41,000 to 51,000 years old.
They could have been in Europe before modern humans got there.
If so, Neanderthals might have figured out how to make the tools themselves, Soressi and her team wrote.
The Freer Gallery of Art in Washington hopes to save Asian artworks for future generations.
For example, some of the older paintings were mounted on acidic paper backings, which deteriorate eventually.
Senior conservator Gu Xiang-mei, who arrived in 1991, trains her apprentices the way she was trained, with traditional, hands-on, practical, and sometimes tedious, work.
"From 1966 to 1972, no any work, all stop," she said.
"We work eight hours a day, six days a week," she said of her training years.

In the rings of ancient and gnarled trees, a team of scientists has found evidence of a period of consistent warmth and wetness in Mongolia between 1211 and 1225.
The abundant grass would in turn increase the number of grazing animals that could live off it.
"He didn\'t have to come eat, and he didn\'t have to eat the way he did, but the table was set and it was a matter of whether or not the culture and the people capitalized on that."
The story of the unusual wet period in Mongolian history was written in scores of ancient Siberian pine trees that Pederson and Hessl first sampled on a whim during a research trip in 2010.
The trees were growing on a nearly soil-less lava field in central Mongolia, dotted with horse skeletons.
Those samples confirmed the initial findings: The spread of the Mongol Empire corresponded with what the trees recorded as a warmer and wetter climate than usual.
Mongolia is an area traditionally known for its cold and dry climate.
When they got them back to the lab, they discovered by looking at the rings inside the trees that some of those samples dated back more than 1,000 years.

The story of the unusual wet period in Mongolian history was written in scores of ancient Siberian pine trees.
They are working with experts from different fields of science and history.
The rings of ancient and gnarled trees may reveal the answer to a important question in history: How did Genghis Khan manage to conquer such a large part of Asia?
Mongolia is an area known for its cold and dry climate.
Yet, the temperatures in this period were unusually mild and rain was heavy.
Having that many horses allowed them to swiftly conquer an enormous area.
She said what mattered is that Khan took advantage of the benefits the weather brought.
The story of the unusual wet period in Mongolian history was written in ancient Siberian pine trees.
The trees in this field are badly in need of water.
On that first trip, Pederson and Hessl took samples from the cores of about a dozen trees.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., upset both athletes and Olympic officials on Wednesday when he suggested that the United States should consider boycotting \u2014 that is, pulling out of in protest \u2014 the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia.
He recently leaked details about the way the NSA has been secretly monitoring phone calls and computer messages in the U.S. and overseas.
The mere suggestion of a boycott was enough for the U.S. Olympic Committee to release a statement that said members "strongly oppose" the idea.
Back in 1980 one of those athletes was Ron Neugent, a member of the U.S. Olympic swimming team.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and John McCain, R-Ariz., told reporters Wednesday they disagreed with Graham.
Indeed, the Soviet Union remained in Afghanistan until 1989.
"Jimmy Carter and his administration were very, very naive in the way that they understood [how] international sports works," he said Wednesday.
Neugent, now an orthodontist in Wichita, Kan., had taken a year off from the University of Kansas to focus on his training.
"Punishing athletes because the government can\'t resolve their issues isn\'t right," he said in an email.
In its statement, the committee referred to the Olympic boycott that occurred in 1980.
Carter intended the boycott as a protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
He was another warlord in an age of warlords.
Leon Jung figured he had to do something out of the ordinary to save his brown front lawn in a second year of water rationing.
You just have to be willing to haul it home in tanks, drums, barrels or jugs \u2014 a rescue operation that seems to be a primitive throwback to the basics in a state with the most highly engineered water delivery systems in America.
Officials said water shortages in the drought have helped many consumers get past the yuck factor of using treated effluent.
The Dublin San Ramon, Livermore and Central Contra Costa Sanitary District sewer plants give the recycled water they distribute extra treatment with sand filters and disinfectant.
Before they haul away their first load, consumers must sign a form pledging not to use the recycled water for drinking or swimming pools and not to put it in household water pipes.
"Some of our customers have become very creative in coming up with systems to get the water into hoses and drip systems," said Melody LaBella, acting water recycling manager at the Central San plant in Martinez.
Leon Jung figured he had to do something out of the ordinary to save his brown front lawn in a second year of water rationing.

In the decades since, Yu and other grassroots history buffs have sought to flesh out the stories of these long-anonymous Chinese migrants and win wider recognition for their role in the building of the American West.
Remarkably little is known of the 12,000 Chinese migrants who came to build the railways in the 1860s.
Many are listed in surviving records only under nicknames like "China Sam" or "China Jim," and so far no letters home or diaries have been found.
He is aiming to create an hour-long documentary on the subject as part of the Stanford effort.
While working on the American railroads, Chinese laborers faced systematic discrimination.
"The way was paved by several generations that really suffered and worked very hard under systematic oppression.
I hope projects like this help the newly arrived see this."
In early June, about 250 people came to Stanford University for a conference on the migrants.
These days, Chinese immigrants to the United States have a much easier time.
Many are listed in surviving records only under nicknames like "China Sam" or "China Jim."
Descendants of about 50 railway workers came from as far away as Hawaii.
"We got some pretty interesting details about who they were," and about their life in the United States, he said.
For the first time, it became possible to travel from the East Coast to the West Coast by train.
Chin Lin Sou, for example, learned to speak English perfectly.
A cluster of violent thunderstorms began marching across the Midwest late in the season.
Their uncannily accurate predictions were combined with television and radio warnings, text-message alerts and storm sirens.
"I\'d say probably two dozen phones started going off in the service, and everybody started looking down," he said.
What they saw was a text message from the National Weather Service cautioning that a twister was in the area.
Bennett stopped the service and ushered everyone to a safe place until the threat passed.
He suffered a leg injury when the wind knocked his home off its foundation.
An outbreak like the one that developed Sunday usually happens about once every seven to 10 years, according to tornado experts at the Storm Prediction Center.
The storms erupted because of unusually warm moist air from Louisiana to Michigan that was then hit by an upper-level cold front.
Because it was high in wind shear, the storm system moved fast, like a speeding car, Brooks said.
That meant the system hit more places before it petered out, affecting more people.
Fans were allowed back to their seats shortly after 2 p.m., and the game resumed after about a two-hour delay.
A friend also called to warn him the storm was nearly upon him.
That crash of hot and cold, dry and wet, is what triggers tornadoes.
But in places where it hit, the system may have been slightly less damaging because it was moving so fast, he said.

According to a new report, young women in the workplace are now very close to earning as much as men with similar jobs.
The report was issued by the Pew Research Center.
Almost 3 out of 5 say that it is easier for men to get top jobs in business and government.
"Nowadays, a childless woman may be able to work every bit as much as her male counterpart," professor Barbara Risman said.
When Kylie Anderson worked in the entertainment business, she noticed other women struggling to balance work and children.
There is also another big difference among millennials: Women are still less likely than men to aspire to becoming the boss.
A few years ago, a Kansas City middle school student passed out during football practice.

She is one of many experts who have combed the terrain for clues on the origin of these potentially dangerous holes, which are about a foot in diameter and seem to survive for less than a day before filling in naturally with sand.
Investigators have used ground-penetrating radar and specialized GPS devices to peek below the landscape, but no one is entirely certain why the holes form along the surface of this landmark, which attracts thousands of visitors each year.
The National Park Service announced this week that Mount Baldy will remain closed indefinitely due to the discovery of two new holes and a number of depressions on the north side slope, though the rest of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore will be open.
Most sad dunes are covered in vegetation compared to Mount Baldy, where the trees and grass \u2014 and even an old staircase that once led to a viewing spot \u2014 are now buried, Argyilan said.
The rest of the national lakeshore will remain open, though officials request patrons stay on designated trails to prevent erosion and damage.
The geology professor had been conducting research at the base of Mount Baldy in mid-July when she heard the screams of parents some 400 feet away, frantically pointing at the ground that swallowed their 6-year-old son.
In August, a second hole was spotted nearby, this one about 10 inches wide and at least 5 feet deep, prompting further study.
While nothing is certain, she believes that holes are unlikely to start appearing at other sand dunes that have been kept in a more natural state.
"We don\'t know exactly what\'s going on out there; we can\'t let folks out onto the area until we know it\'s safe," said Ken Mehne, law enforcement specialist for Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.
The 126-foot dune has been shifting away from the lake shore at an alarming rate, covering the old landscape in sand, experts have said.

<img class="pull-right" src="//newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/20131008_Higgs_boson_Nobel.jpg" />STOCKHOLM \u2014 Francois Englert of Belgium and Peter Higgs of Britain won the Nobel Prize in physics on Tuesday for their theory on how the most basic building blocks of the universe acquired the mass they needed to eventually form the world we know today.
Asked whether he could have imagined getting a Nobel Prize when he started the research 50 years ago, the 80-year-old Englert said no.
Just awarding the men behind the theoretical discovery of the particle solved a tricky problem for the committee.
Academy member Ulf Danielsson noted that the prize announcement also honored the work done at CERN.
"This is a giant discovery, it means the final building block in the so-called standard model for particle physics has been put in place," Danielsson said.
The tiny particle, they believed, acts like molasses on snow \u2014 causing other basic building blocks of nature to stick together, slow down and form atoms.
As particles travel through the field, they are slowed down like a ball rolling through molasses.
If this is the case, then it should be possible to detect a type of particle, dubbed the Higgs boson, where the fields clump together.
Michael Turner, president of the American Physical Society, an organization of physicists, said the Higgs particle captured the imagination of the public.
"If you\'re a physicist, you can\'t get in a taxi anywhere in the world without having the driver ask you about the Higgs particle," said Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago.
On Monday, the Nobel Prize in medicine was given to American scientists James Rothman, Randy Schekman and Thomas Sudhof for discoveries about how key substances are moved around within cells.
The award money and medals will be handed out on Dec. 10 \u2014 the anniversary of his death in 1896.
Each prize is worth 8 million Swedish kronor ($1.2 million).

<img class="pull-right" src="//newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/20131008_Higgs_boson_Nobel.jpg" />STOCKHOLM \u2014 About 50 years ago, scientists were trying to figure out how the smallest building blocks of the universe were able to come together.
They came up with the Higgs particle.
The 80-year-old Englert said he did not imagine getting a Nobel Prize when he started the research half a century ago.
Nobel Academy member Ulf Danielsson pointed out that the prize document also honored the work done at CERN.
Englert and Higgs came up with the idea of the Higgs boson to provide an answer to a riddle: Why matter has mass.
Scientists wondered how matter formed shortly after the Big Bang.
They had an explanation that centers on the idea that there is an invisible field throughout the universe.
It took about 50 years before scientists at CERN were able to show its existence in July 2012.
The crashes produced energies like those right after the Big Bang that supposedly marked the origin of the universe.

Female loggerheads deposited eggs in 46,885 nests this year.
"Every year, it\'s always a little bit of a surprise for what we get," said Anne Meylan, a scientist at the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute.
Since 2010, loggerhead nest counts at the index sites have improved.
Most people stopped killing them, and guess what, they came back," Ehrhart said.
Between the time they hit the water as hatchlings and the time they come back 800- or 900-pound adults, there are hardly any records of them appearing anywhere."
Welcome to the mysterious world of sea turtles.
"We don\'t know why they went down, and we don\'t know why they are coming back," Meylan said.

Yellowstone is not an ideal home for grizzlies.
Its 700 grizzlies share 3,400 square miles, which is enough room to support the bears well enough that Fish and Wildlife is expected later this year to remove federal protections for grizzlies in the region.
His group wants to release 300 to 400 bears in the area on a stretch of public land with overlapping parks and wilderness areas.
The grizzly deserves its fearsome reputation, especially in contrast to the black bear.
Dave Graber, a former scientist for the National Park Service, has traveled in grizzly areas around the country.
For over two decades now, the theft has remained a mystery to the FBI, the police and the people of Boston.
Another work, "The Concert" by Johannes Vermeer, is thought to be the world\'s most valuable stolen painting.
"Today, we are pleased to announce that the FBI has made significant investigative progress in the search for the stolen art," special agent Richard DesLauriers told reporters at a news conference.
"We\'ve determined in the years after the theft that the art was transported to the Connecticut and Philadelphia regions.
There is now a $5 million reward out for any tips that might help bring the artworks home.
"You don\'t have to hand us the paintings to be eligible for the reward," said Anthony Amore, the museum security chief.
"It\'s likely over time someone has seen the art hanging on a wall, placed above a mantel, or stored in an attic.
"The key goal here is to recover those paintings and bring them back," Ortiz said during the publicity campaign at the FBI\'s Boston headquarters.
The museum is named after Isabella Gardner, who spent three decades collecting the art that is now inside.
Gardner opened her museum in 1903 with a grand party where doughnuts and champagne were served.

The FBI has interviewed people around the globe to try and find the missing art.
But investigators have not had much success in the case until recently.
The $5 million reward is for any tips that might help bring the artworks home.
The FBI said that it now has been so long since the crime that it would be difficult to prosecute the men involved.
Investigators could still charge people who have handled or sold the stolen paintings.
The museum is named after Isabella Gardner, who spent 30 years collecting the art that is now inside.
Gardner wore a white headband on which she had written "Oh, you Red Sox!"
The museum\'s website says that this led a local newspaper to call her "a woman gone crazy."
One painting by Rembrandt is more than 380 years old.
On Monday, detectives asked the public to help them find a number of rare artworks.
They were stolen from a museum in Boston 23 years ago.
The FBI said it now knows the names of the burglars.
The police could still charge people who had handled or sold the stolen paintings.
But officers said that they might agree not to arrest people in exchange for information about the missing art.

Yet this engineer is out to change the world with the Urbee, a unique hybrid vehicle that dares to be plastic, can zip across the country on 10 gallons of fuel and is manufactured using a sophisticated 3-D printer.
While 3-D printing has long been used to make gears, grilles, tools, parts and prototypes for other manufacturers, it had never been used to build the entire body of a car.
The Urbee uses eight times less energy than the average little car."
But Kor first needs $3 million to convert drawings into reality.

The survey found that while 51 percent of families earning more than $60,000 per year reported having a child in sports, only 30 percent of lower-income families had a child playing school sports.
Sports participation among lower-income students decreased by 10 percent compared to the May 2012 poll on the same subject.
Even among parents in higher-income households, nearly 1 in 10 parents said their child had decreased sports participation because of cost \u2013 twice as high as reported in 2012.
Having to pay to play school sports may have long-reaching health effects, according to a newly released University of Michigan survey that may reinforce a link between income and health.

Overall, however, the results are troubling.
Parents whose children play school sports are required to pay various fees in order to cover some of the costs of sports programs.
"Sports is one way that kids can be physically active in an enjoyable way," said Sarah Clark, an expert on children\'s health.
For example, regular exercise helps prevent kids from putting on too much weight.
One in 7 parents whose children were not playing sports said cost was a reason.

It was sold to a French company by Hasbro in 2001.
An Atari spokesman quoted in the story said the games came from its plant in El Paso, Texas, some 80 miles south of Alamogordo.
A recurring flaw, she said, was that the character of the game, the beloved extraterrestrial, would fall into traps that were almost impossible to escape and would appear constantly and unpredictably.

She was hoping to catch pieces of a mysterious marine ecosystem that scientists are calling the plastisphere.
About 245 million tons of plastic is produced annually around the world, according to industry estimates.
Once trapped in these cyclonic dead zones, plastic particles may persist for centuries.
The physiological effects of visible plastic debris on the fish, birds, turtles and marine mammals that ingest it are well-documented: clogged intestines, suffocation, loss of vital nutrients, starvation.
He observed that these particles enabled the growth of algae and probably bacteria and speculated that hazardous chemicals showing up in ocean animals may have leached out of bits of plastic.
From Woods Hole to the University of Hawaii, scientists are collecting seawater and marine life so they can analyze the types, sizes and chemical compositions of the plastic fragments they contain.
"We\'re changing the basic rhythms of life in the world\'s oceans, and we need to understand the consequences of that," said marine biologist Miriam Goldstein, who earned her doctorate at UC San Diego\'s Scripps Institution of Oceanography by studying plastic debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch between Hawaii and California.
In October, Goldstein and oceanographer Deb Goodwin of the Sea Education Association in Woods Hole reported that one-third of the gooseneck barnacles they collected from the garbage patch had plastic particles in their guts.
The typical fragment measured 1.4 millimeters across, not much bigger than a piece of glitter, according to their report in the journal PeerJ.
Fish that ingest plastic debris tend to accumulate hazardous substances in their bodies and suffer from liver toxicity, according to a study published in the journal Scientific Reports.
Not only was the plastic itself dangerous, so too were the toxic chemicals the plastic had absorbed.

The Webb Schools, a private high school in Claremont, is a magnet for college recruiters from around the country and the world.
Among schools in affluent communities: La Canada High School hosted 127 visits from recruiters between August and November.
By contrast, Pasadena High School had 20 visits over the fall semester; Compton High, five; Hoover High in Glendale, 15; Santa Ana High, five; Belmont High near downtown Los Angeles, about 25; Roosevelt High in Boyle Heights, 20.

He said some colleges probably stay away from public schools because they don\'t think "there could be a student in this school who has the potential to win the next Nobel Prize, come up with a new technology or change the world."
In research that tracked young Latino and black men with good grades in New York City, Harper found that many colleges avoided their high schools, wrongly assuming "that nothing good is going on."
Recruiters say they seek talented minority and low-income students through large college fairs, citywide recruiting sessions, online outreach and videotaped presentations.
Given limits on recruiters\' time, the pattern of high school visits can be "self-perpetuating," said Robert Springall, admissions dean at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania.
His representative visited about two dozen high schools in the Los Angeles region this fall, including Marlborough and La Canada, but no schools in the L.A. Unified district.

"We had the illusion of control and it\'s just been shown to us that oh, folks, you know what?
Part of the problem, said Andrew Thomas, the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Transportation Security, is that airline systems are not as sophisticated as many people might think.
A case in point, he said, is that airports and airplanes around the world use antiquated radar tracking technology, first developed in the 1950s, rather than modern GPS systems.
"The next-generation technology would cost $70 to $80 billion in the U.S." Experts say the plane\'s disappearance will likely put pressure on airlines and governments to improve the way they monitor planes, including handoff procedures between countries.
It has been nearly 50 years since a plane carrying more than two dozen people vanished without a trace, according to a list of unexplained aviation disappearances tracked by the Flight Safety Foundation.
More than two dozen countries are involved in the effort to find Flight 370 and end the uncertainty, with dozens of aircraft and boats searching along a vast arc where investigators believe the plane ended up, judging by signals received by a satellite.
But you know, I think everyone thought that about Amelia Earhart as well," said Phaedra Hise, a pilot and author of "Pilot Error: The Anatomy of a Plane Crash."
Which is a little scary, isn\'t it?"
"We had the illusion of control and it\'s just been shown to us that oh, folks, you know what?
Earhart, the first female pilot to cross the Atlantic Ocean, vanished over the Pacific with her navigator, Fred Noonan, during an attempt to fly around the globe.
One of the best theories has her running out of fuel and crash-landing on a reef near Gardner Island, now called Nikumaroro, in the Pacific Ocean.
A case in point, he said, is that airports and airplanes around the world use old radar tracking technology, instead of modern GPS satellite navigation systems.
"In any kind of death, the most important matter for relatives and loved ones is knowing" what happened and how it happened, said Kevin Tso, the chief executive of New Zealand agency Victim Support.

Rabbi Michael Lerner, a philosopher and long-time student of the Middle East, has written in the wake of the Paris attack, "Until the powerful countries of the world are seen as mainly driven by a desire to care for the well-being of everyone else on the planet and the well-being of the planet itself, and care not only out of self-interest but also out of a new consciousness in which we all come to truly understand our mutual interdependence and oneness, what we saw in Paris this past week is destined to be an increasing reality in the coming decades."
The Paris attack provides a new and compelling reason for the West to take action to undercut the negative sentiment about the West.
The lack of a solution for that conflict, which has been festering for so long, bears a direct relation to the carnage in Paris.

The support of the Western powers, and particularly the United States, of Israel was a battle cry for Osama bin Laden when he first organized al-Qaida in the 1990s.
With tens of thousands of foreign fighters and sophisticated social networking, Islamic State already had a global reach.
Its conquering of territory rich in oil made it the wealthiest militant organization in history.
Since then, Islamic State has demonstrated the capacity to adapt and innovate, combining the most effective terror practices developed by extremist groups over the last three decades.
They are unfolding across Europe and, most dramatically, in Paris as America watches.

This is unwelcome news for a president who boasted of ending the war in Iraq and withdrawing U.S. troops.
French President Francois Hollande speaks of a war against the Islamic State group, just like U.S. President George W. Bush spoke of a war against al-Qaida after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States.

We must do so in a way that undermines the anti-Western attitudes that lead to indiscriminate violence of the kind we saw on the streets of Paris.
The Paris attacks provide a new and compelling reason for the West to take action to undercut the negative sentiment about the West.
Twin bomb blasts exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon Monday, killing three people, wounding scores of others, and renewing fears that American cities are vulnerable to deadly terror attacks.
The other victims were a 29-year-old woman and a Boston University student from China.

Archaeologists have been studying the site since 1994 when the original James Fort \u2014 long thought to be lost and submerged in the James River \u2014 was rediscovered.
He died at the age of 34 during a six-month period known as the "starving time" when many perished due to disease, starvation and battles with Indians.
So the discovery raises the question of whether Archer was perhaps part of a secret Catholic cell \u2014 or even a Catholic spy on behalf of the Spanish, Horn said.
The silk material was too delicate to remove from the dirt, so archaeologists removed an entire block of dirt for preservation.
Archaeologists will continue searching the church site and expect to eventually find the burial of Sir Thomas West, the early governor of Virginia who led a rescue mission to save Jamestown when the colony was collapsing, Horn said.
Still they will work to complete more testing and potentially DNA analysis.
The archaeology team said the discovery is like a riddle they must figure out over time.
"What we have discovered here in the earliest English church in America are four of the first leaders of America," said historian James Horn who is president of the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation.
Historical records indicate Archer helped lead some of the earliest expeditions to Jamestown.

Chris Christie issued a statement Monday saying he "reluctantly" signed a bill that prohibits attempts to convert children from gay to straight.
He cited the American Psychological Association, which has found the treatment can lead to depression, substance abuse, and suicidal thoughts.
His past comments set him apart from the more conservative wing of the Republican Party, which holds that homosexuality is a sin and is a choice.
During committee hearings, witnesses described brutal childhood experiences in which they were subjected to conversion therapy efforts.
"Studies and personal testimony have shown this practice creates irreparable harm on young people struggling to come to terms with their sexuality," one of the bill\'s sponsors, Assemblyman Tim Eustace, D-Maywood, said in a statement Monday.
Until Monday, Christie has mostly earned only criticism from gay advocates.
Morgan asked Christie if homosexuality is a sin and the governor, who is Catholic, responded that his religion says it is.
The legislation passed the Assembly by a 56-14 vote with seven abstentions in June.
His opponents argue that same-sex marriage is a civil right, and such rights should not be decided by popular vote.

To plague aficionados, the Justinian Plague, which in the 6th century AD is thought to have killed 30 million to 50 million from Asia to Africa to Europe, is hardly a footnote.
"Fortunately, we now have antibiotics that could effectively be used to treat plague," said study co-author Dave Wagner of Northern Arizona University\'s Center for Microbial Genetics and Genomics.
For now, the authors can only conjecture that either human populations evolved to become less susceptible to its deadly ways or that climatic changes taking place at the time created a less hospitable environment for the Justinian Plague pathogen.
Evidence for the latter possibility includes the fact that all three plagues\u2014the Justinian Plague, the Black Plague and the plague that surged in the late 1800s and early 1900s\u2014followed periods of exceptional rainfall and ended periods of climatic stability.

And if the fans are not needed, why do we watch?
"It\'s a big part of why we come out here and do what we do," he said in an interview in the dugout before the game.
"You\'re taking away from the fans, but I understand there is bigger stuff going on than baseball right now," said Benjamin Fluke, 19, a criminal justice major at the University of Baltimore who watched from outside.
"It breaks my heart that it had to come to this," he said, speaking of the riots that had left the city bruised.
These are the sounds of baseball: the crack of a wooden bat hitting a ball; the pop of a ball hitting a glove; the organ; the cheering fans.

Bullets were still flying in San Bernardino when President Barack Obama, sitting for a scheduled television interview, issued a now-familiar call for more gun control.
That is a far more complex debate with fewer clear-cut policy prescriptions.
The president has said he worries about the difficulties of preventing a homegrown or "lone-wolf" attacker on U.S. soil \u2014 and the limits of security measures to prevent them.
He asked for patience, assured Americans they were safe and, notably, toned down his typically full-throated call for congressional action on gun control.
After a briefing from his national security team, Obama asked the American people and "legislatures" to find a way to make "it a little harder" for people to get guns.
"And we\'re going to have to, I think, search ourselves as a society to make sure that we can take basic steps that would make it harder \u2014 not impossible, but harder \u2014 for individuals to get access to weapons," he said.
For his part, Trump initially cast such shootings as "a mental health issue, to a large extent," in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday night.
He offered another explanation Thursday.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday that Obama was not backing off his push to drive a conversation about gun measures.
Cruz told a crowd of Jewish activists that "all of us are deeply concerned that this is yet another manifestation of terrorism, radical Islamic terrorism here at home."

On Friday, the National Parks Service announced that it intended to ban low-flying drones on the 84 million acres of land it manages, citing concerns about visitor safety and the impact on wildlife.
The FAA estimated in a report that there could be 7,500 civilian hobbyist drones in use within five years.
Saulmon also has flown his drone over South Bay oil refineries and along the Hermosa Beach pier.
In April, volunteers at Zion National Park in Utah watched a drone buzz over a herd of bighorn sheep, separating the adults from the young.
It\'s easy to see the drone, it\'s easy to recognize the privacy implications."
"It\'s going to take one of those dropping out of the sky and hitting someone, or a movie star making a big issue out of it," said Terry Yamamoto, Los Angeles County Fire Department\'s South Bay lifeguard division chief.
"It was kind of an eye-opener for us that this is something we really need to pay attention to," said LAPD Commander Andrew Smith about the drone outside the Kings game.
He created a website on which he regularly posts videos shot at police drunk driving checkpoints.

And at Mount Rushmore, a ranger confiscated a drone after it flew around the national monument and over the heads of visitors.
"Those are the kinds of things that have been going on," said National Park Service spokesman Jeffrey Olson, who said drones bother people and animals.
"It was kind of an eye-opener for us that this is something we really need to pay attention to," said LAPD Commander Andrew Smith about the drone outside the Kings game.

He recognized the cave \u2014 he had been there before.
In the early 1970s, Lokey and a group of fellow adventurers explored and mapped the ice caves of Mount Rainier.
Lokey always hoped to return to study the caves in more detail, and this summer, he finally crossed paths with a dream team of experts who shared his passion.
On Tuesday afternoon, the sky darkened and pellets of snow began to fall.
The combination of volcanic heat and gas, frigid water and icy soil is similar to conditions on Earth when the first living things appeared.
Bill Lokey planted his ax in the crumbly slope and scanned the cavern with his headlamp.
They used tape measures and compasses to make maps of the passages.
Bill Lokey was standing in a huge cave below the summit of Mount Rainier, a 14,411-foot-high volcano in Washington state.
When the observatory at One World Trade Center (1 WTC) opens May 29 in lower Manhattan, visitors will be treated to a spectacular 360-degree view of New York City and the surrounding area from nearly 390 meters (1,280 feet) above its bustling streets.
Elevators must also account for minute changes in the distance between guide rails that occur as changes in temperature, wind and other conditions cause skyscrapers to sway slightly throughout the course of a day.
At 1 WTC, engineers are minimizing elevator car jostling using what is known as an "active roller guide" system.
"With an area of high pressure above the car and low pressure below it, you\'re creating a situation where the hoistway doors above the car want to blow out into the hallway and the hoistway doors below the car want to suck into the hoistway," Koshak explains.
Air pressure changes that affect people inside the car are more difficult to mitigate, however.
Elevators generally do not descend faster than 36 kilometers per hour (22 miles per hour), however, because anything faster can lead to ear-popping.
Traffic management is a crucial part of elevator use in high-rise buildings.
The elevator systems at 1 WTC rely on a kiosk setup in the lobby that determines which elevator a particular visitor will ride.

Like bullet trains, fast-moving elevators also require incredibly smooth rails and rail joints to move swiftly.
"With an area of high pressure above the car and low pressure below it, you\'re creating a situation where the hoistway doors above the car want to blow out into the hallway and the hoistway doors below the car want to suck into the hoistway," Koshak explains.
The new building has a hollow concrete core that serves as a structural backbone for the building.

The observatory at One World Trade Center (1 WTC) opens May 29 in lower Manhattan.
In addition to being speedy, the elevators serving 1 WTC feature several advanced technologies designed to improve ride quality and safety.
Such features show just how far technology has advanced since the first passenger elevator was introduced in 1857.
"These factors mean that you can\'t ever have a perfect plane for an elevator to travel in very tall buildings," elevator expert John Koshak said.
These active roller-guide systems are "like hugely intelligent shock absorbers," Koshak says.
As a typical 10,000-pound car with a 16,000-pound counterweight rushes up its hoistway, a massive quantity of air is displaced.
The rapid movement creates "an area of high pressure above the car and low pressure below it," Koshak explains.

When word spread \u2014 mistakenly \u2014 that Los Angeles-based Baby2Baby was handing out diapers directly to parents, desperate parents came to its office and formed a line that snaked around the corner in just a couple of hours, said co-chair Norah Weinstein.
A single mother earning $15,080 a year in a [minimum-wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) job would need to devote more than 6 percent of her pay to diapers, according to the Pediatrics study.
The report in Pediatrics is the first academic study to quantify diaper need, said co-authors Megan Smith of the Yale School of Medicine and Joanne Goldblum of the National Diaper Bank Network both in New Haven.
Women 45 or older (who the team assumed were mostly caring for grandchildren) also had greater need.
Women who said they had a lot of difficulty managing stress, sadness or trauma were nearly twice as likely as others to report diaper need, said Smith, a psychologist whose work focuses on maternal mental health.
Nearly 8 percent of the women in the study reported that they stretched diapers when supplies ran short.
In 2011, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., introduced a bill in Congress that would have made it easier for child-care providers to use federal funds to supply diapers to needy families.
For now, much of the need will be met by nonprofits like the National Diaper Bank Network, which counts Baby2Baby and L.A.
Diapers have been the one incentive that keeps parents showing up for class, said Aubrey, who added that providing access to diapers "instills confidence" in struggling parents.
Most child-care providers require parents to supply diapers.
There have been days since her son Ezekiel was born 11 months ago that Los Angeles mom Beth Capper has gone without food to keep up her supply.
The nonprofit also received 3,000 voicemail messages that day.
"No one wants to have their child in a soiled diaper all day long," she said.
According to a report published in the journal Pediatrics, diaper need affects a "substantial" number of low-income Americans.
Nearly 30 percent of mothers questioned live in New Haven, Conn. and report that they did not have enough diapers for their children.
And cloth diapers are often not an option because they require frequent and expensive trips to the laundromat.
Women who said they had a lot of difficulty managing stress, sadness or trauma were nearly twice as likely as others to report diaper need, said Smith.
In Los Angeles, organizations report that the need for diapers is constant.
When word spread that a Los Angeles-based organization was handing out diapers directly to parents, desperate parents came to its office.
The organization also received 3,000 voicemail messages that day.
Parents in need can get financial support from the government to pay their health-care costs.
They also asked the women about access to basic needs like food, housing and diapers.
In order to get diapers for their children, the women had to ask for help from organizations, friends or family.
Wearing the same diaper for too long can lead to problems.
Those problems include skin rashes and bacterial infections that require medicine.
Parents in need can get financial support from the government to pay their health-care costs.
They went to schools, stores, bus stops, beauty parlors and other locations in New Haven to talk to mothers.
Since then there have been days that Capper has  gone without food.
Parents in need can get money from the government to help pay their health-care costs.
Diaper need also affects how much money families have, Smith and Goldblum said.
Representative Rosa DeLauro wanted to make it easier for parents to get diapers.
Word for word, page by page, through the story of the little girls who left the house at half past 9, in two straight lines, in rain or shine, the smallest and most fearless one being Madeline.
But some of us have been celebrating "Madeline," and other special books of our childhoods, all along, by passing our love of these classics on to our own children.
Then it was on to my favorite chapter books \u2014 "Chancy and the Grand Rascal," "Knight\'s Castle" and, of course, "The Phantom Tollbooth," the Norton Juster classic illustrated by Jules Feiffer.
It is high body art praise.
A recent BuzzFeed post of tattoos based on children\'s books included such classics beloved by baby boomers as "The Velveteen Rabbit," "The Little Prince," "Goodnight Moon," "Corduroy," "Winnie the Pooh," "The Phantom Tollbooth" \u2014 and "Madeline."
All I have to do is read the last page of "Madeline" to hear my mother\'s voice whisper those last lines: _And she turned out the light \u2014 and closed the door \u2014 and that\'s all there is \u2014 there isn\'t any more._ Childhood books feel utterly real, even if they are populated by talking animals.
A friend of mine recalls watching her husband reading "Little House on the Prairie" to their 7-year-old son.
A friend of mine tried three different times to introduce her sons to "Winnie the Pooh," which she adored as a girl but finds slow going today.
The girls loved all of them, these books I knew so well they seemed tattooed into my memory.
So my older daughter had a couple of them tattooed onto her skin.

Then it was on to my favorite chapter books \u2014 "Chancy and the Grand Rascal," "Knight\'s Castle" and, of course, "The Phantom Tollbooth."
In the book, the bored boy receives a mysterious gift of a tollbooth that leads him into adventures rich characters like Tock the watchdog, whose body is a watch face.

The organism responsible, Naegleria fowleri, dwells in warm freshwater lakes and rivers and usually targets children and young adults.
It probably takes more than a drop of liquid to trigger a Naegleria infection; infections usually occur in people who have been engaging in water sports or other activities that may forcefully suffuse the nose with lots of water \u2014 diving, waterskiing, wakeboarding, and in one case a baptism dunking.
After reaching the olfactory bulbs, N. fowleri feasts on the tissue there using suction-cup-like structures on its surface.
Neck stiffness in particular is attributable to the inflammation, as the swelling around the spinal cord makes it impossible to flex the muscles.
The threat of contracting an N. fowleri infection is remote (vastly more people die every year from drowning), but you can take some measures to lower your risk even further.
Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Miltefosine, originally intended as an anti-cancer treatment.
Their insights may help us understand what makes it so virulent and point the way to better treatments.
Since then, however, infections have popped up as far north as Minnesota.
When the body notices that something is wrong, it sends immune cells to combat the infection, causing the surrounding area to become inflamed.
Neck stiffness in particular is attributable to the inflammation, as the swelling around the spinal cord makes it impossible to flex the muscles.

The amoeba moves to the olfactory bulbs in the front of the brain.
Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Miltefosine, a drug originally intended as an anti-cancer treatment.
"We\'re seeing it in states where we hadn\'t seen cases before," says Jennifer Cope.
The infections could be moving to other places because of climate change, Cope said, as Naegleria thrives in warmer temperatures.
This causes the surrounding area to become inflamed.
They include confusion, seeing things that are not there, having trouble making sense and involuntary muscle movements.
It lives in warm freshwater lakes and rivers.
The olfactory nerve leads directly to the brain.
Those symptoms show up about five days after the infection sets in.
When the body notices that something is wrong, it sends cells to combat the infection.
Increasing pressure forces the brain down into where the brain stem meets the spinal cord.
Eventually the connection between the two breaks.
Most patients die from losing their ability to breathe less than two weeks after the symptoms began.

Those membranes are the slimy stuff inside your nasal cavity.
People who get infections usually have been doing some sort of sport or other activity that forces water up the nose.

President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama announced Tuesday that the administration will expand a program to help adolescent girls across the world receive an education.
Existing government programs address topics such as education, leadership, nutrition and protection against gender-based violence and forced marriages.
The president and first lady said this issue is personal to them because they are the parents of two daughters.
"Peace Corps volunteers are in a unique position to break down barriers to girls education at the community level," Hessler-Radelet said.
More countries will be included the following year, according to the White House.
National security adviser Susan Rice said this initiative comes "at a vital moment."

"The drama of what happened, how it happened; it\'s so moving to me and so powerful, and for me to look at some of the drawings, it almost makes me cry," he said in an interview.
He told them that a comic book in the 1950s, "Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story," had inspired him when he was 17, growing up 50 miles from Montgomery.
Aydin said he was there working for Lewis that day, watching a moment in history that his boss and many others had helped make possible.
More needs to be done to shine a light on that era, he thought, and the comic book might be the way to do it.

More needs to be done to shine a light on that era, he thought, and the comic book might be the way to do it.
He remembered the beatings, bus bombing, the dogs and fire hoses turned on protesting children by police.
"The drama of what happened, how it happened \u2014 it\'s so moving to me and so powerful, and for me to look at some of the drawings, it almost makes me cry," he said.
Lewis\' first book, the best-selling "March: Book One," begins when he was a boy on his parents\' farm in Alabama.
To show this was wrong, they sat at the counters reserved for whites and refused to move, in an act called sit-ins.
Lewis was one of six organizers, and is the only one still living.
Last year, a grand jury decided not to indict, or charge, the white police officer who shot and killed unarmed black youth Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
It was preposterous," Aydin said, "But it was still a good idea."

The civil rights era has received attention lately because of the film "Selma."
The move is based on the famous march from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital in Montgomery in 1965.
During the march, Lewis, one of its leaders, was hit in the head by police.
Most states did not do a good job teaching about the time period, according to the report.

The federal jury that sentenced Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death on Friday had already found him guilty on every possible count for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing two years ago.
"The choice between these very serious alternatives is yours, and yours alone, to make," O\'Toole said Wednesday.
A death sentence on any of these counts had to be unanimous, because if even one juror chose life imprisonment over death, the sentence for that count would automatically be life in prison.
"He killed indiscriminately to make a political statement, and he placed no value on the lives and didn\'t care for a second what impact his actions and his killings would have on so many other innocent family members and friends," Steven Mellin, a U.S. attorney, said during the government\'s closing arguments.
Judy Clarke, the defense attorney who bluntly stated "It was him" during her opening statements, used her closing argument to paint a picture of the older brother as Tsarnaev\'s "sole source of family, of support, of strength."
The federal jury that sentenced Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death on Friday had already found him guilty on every possible count for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing two years ago.
The jurors were told to consider two sets of factors when considering the sentence.
One bombing victim in particular \u2014 8-year-old Martin Richard \u2014 was cited repeatedly as an aggravating factor.
"He killed indiscriminately to make a political statement, and he placed no value on the lives and didn\'t care for a second what impact his actions and his killings would have on so many other innocent family members and friends," Steven Mellin, a U.S. attorney, said during the government\'s closing arguments.
This week, however, they were told to answer another question: What should happen to him?
Only if they agreed on this should they sentence him to death, the judge said.
The federal jury that sentenced Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death on Friday had already found him guilty on every possible count for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing two years ago.
After finding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on every possible count for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing two years ago, a jury was told to answer another question.
If even one juror chose life imprisonment over death, the sentence would automatically be life in prison.
"His actions have earned him a sentence of death," Mellin said.
Judy Clarke, his defense lawyer, used her closing argument to paint a picture of the older brother as Tsarnaev\'s "sole source of family, of support, of strength."
"The law values life, and you have no obligation to vote for death," Clarke said to the jurors.
The federal death penalty law prevents a death sentence for anyone younger than 18 when they committed a crime.
Jurors were told to consider only the evidence presented in the trial.
They are not supposed to consider anything they may have read in the media or other information that was not presented in the trial.
Tsarnaev is now the 62nd person on federal death row waiting to be executed.

After finding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on every possible count for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing two years ago, a jury was told to answer another question.
On Friday, the jury sentenced Tsarnaev to death.
The federal death penalty law prevents a death sentence for anyone younger than 18 when they committed a crime.
The stream of appeals would keep Tsarnaev in the news and his case in their lives.
"He placed no value on the lives and didn\'t care for a second what impact his actions and his killings would have on so many other innocent family members and friends,"  Mellin told the jurors.
Judy Clarke, Tsarnaev\'s defense lawyer, painted a picture of the older brother as Tsarnaev\'s "sole source of family, of support, of strength."
The jurors spent 14 hours discussing the case before they agreed on the sentence.
Last month, a jury found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.
On April 15, 2013, Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, exploded two bombs at the Boston Marathon.
The federal death penalty law prevents a death sentence for anyone younger than 18 when they committed the crime.
If even one jury member said no to the death penalty, Tsarnaev would have been sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison.
He said that Tsarnaev did not value the lives of his victims.
They had to agree that Tsarnaev was 18 years old because federal law prevents a death sentence for anyone younger than 18 at the time of the crime.

Muslims from across the world poured Sunday into a sprawling tent city in the Saudi desert before the start of the annual Islamic hajj pilgrimage, but the number of the pilgrims this year has been reduced in part by concerns over a respiratory virus centered in the Arabian peninsula.

From Mina, the pilgrims will head on Monday to the area of Mount Arafat near a hill called Jabal al-Rahman, meaning Mountain of Mercy.
It is in Mount Arafat, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of Mecca, that Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad called on people to abolish their feuds and put aside their racial, economic and tribal differences.
This year, though, some pilgrims are wearing masks as a precaution against the Middle East respiratory syndrome, which has stricken nearly 100 people, most of them in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East.
Similarly, Egyptian pilgrim Essam Hassouna said he is praying for his country, which saw its worst violence in August when more than 1,000 people were killed in clashes after the military ousted President Mohammed Morsi from power.
The Saudi health minister, Abdullah al-Rabiah, said late Saturday that no cases of the coronavirus infection have been detected among pilgrims.
The Grand Mosque in Mecca has also changed dramatically, expanding to accommodate the growing number of pilgrims.

"The Star-Spangled Banner" is hard to sing and sometimes hard to remember.
It is also very patriotic and stirs deep feelings among U.S. citizens.
There was also a concert named "Anthem for America."
He wrote the four verses on a single sheet and called it "The Defence of Fort McHenry," in honor of the defenders of the fort.
It also came to refer to the giant flag made by Mary Pickersgill that Key saw that day.
But why is the anthem so hard to sing?
"The Star-Spangled Banner" is hard to sing and sometimes hard to remember.
"People sing the song all the time, but don\'t know anything about it," said Jennifer Jones, an expert on military history at the museum.
That happened to pop star Christina Aguilera at the beginning of Super Bowl XLV in February 2011.
For a national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner" is very hard to sing.
The society owns the manuscript and is loaning it to the Smithsonian through July 6.
The verses were published in a newspaper and became popular quickly.
"We hope as a national museum, people will be inspired to learn more about history and to be part of history," Jones said.
This year, the song is turning 200 years old.
They want everyone to learn about the flag and the song on its 200th birthday.

Believing that "black religion" had caused the uprising, South Carolina instituted a series of draconian measures against African-American churches and communities, including a ban on services conducted without a white person present.
The Charleston A.M.E. congregation was dispersed and their building set ablaze.
After the end of the Civil War, the A.M.E. congregation \u2014 which had been conducting services in secret for decades and worked as part of the Underground Railroad \u2014 was formally re-established and adopted the name Emanuel.
"If we\'re not safe in the church, God, you tell us where we are safe," mourners at a prayer circle told a reporter for MSNBC.
"They\'ve been sites of black protest and community organizing, and they have long been targets as well," he said, noting the long list of racist attacks on black churches, particularly the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.
This historic congregation, the oldest of its kind in the South, had already seen more than its fair share of tumult and hate.
It was founded by worshippers fleeing racism and burned to the ground for its connection with a thwarted slave revolt.
It was jolted by an earthquake in 1886.
Civil rights luminaries spoke from its pulpit and led marches from its steps.
For nearly 200 years it had been the site of struggle, resistance and change.
In Charleston, the church is affectionately known as "Mother Emanuel," a nod to its age and its eminence in the community.
"Where you are is a very special place in Charleston," the most recent pastor, Clementa Pinckney, told a group of visitors two years ago.
According to a PBS documentary, white Charlestonians constantly monitored the church, sometimes disrupting services and arresting worshippers.

gunman opened fire on a group of worshippers gathered inside Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina, on Wednesday.
It has been "tied to the history and life of African-Americans since about the early 1800s."
Vesey fiercely preached that the enslavement of African-Americans would be punished with death.
However, a slave named George Wilson told his master about the plot.
By the 20th century, Emanuel A.M.E. was once again a center of black struggle.
A civil rights movement had sprung up, which aimed to win equal rights for African-Americans.
Business students at one for-profit college soon will have a new way to earn credits: by playing computer games.
Rasmussen College in Bloomington, Minnesota, announced last week that beginning in July it will offer game-based courses \u2014 with no instructors \u2014 as part of its associate degree in business management.
David Weerts, an associate professor of higher education at the University of Minnesota, said that gaming technology can be useful for teaching some skills.
The risk, he said, is jumping into such a program without "proof of concept that people are gaining something from this."
Nancy Black, an anthropology professor at Metro State University, was even more dubious.
She also questioned how a computer game could evaluate a student\'s judgment skills, especially "with no faculty whatsoever."

Rasmussen College in Bloomington, Minnesota, announced last week that beginning in July it will offer game-based courses \u2014 with no instructors \u2014 as part of its associate degree in business management.
Depending on the answers, the game rates their performance and gives feedback, said Timothy Loatman, who directs technology-based education services for Rasmussen.
The Rasmussen plan, though, is likely to meet some skepticism, in part because it eliminates the role of teachers from some of the courses.
But he said he was wary of "this kind of robotized new system."

Operating a small aerial drone over hundreds of acres of corn, Zach Fiene can receive detailed pictures of the crop on his iPad.
From the images, or a live video, he can see exactly what parts of a field are struggling with plant disease, insects or a lack of water.
In a matter of minutes, he can gather as much information as someone could get in several hours walking through the field.
"You can basically point the camera to where you want it to go," said Fiene, co-owner of DMZ Aerial in Prairie du Sac and Whitewater.
"You might walk past a problem area, not see it, and three weeks later the corn is dead because disease has spread," he said.
"Every time there\'s a report of a drone almost hitting a plane, that\'s not good for us because the regulations aren\'t finalized yet," Fiene said.
I have told farmers to look up their address on Google Earth, and they would be amazed at the pictures out there," said Casey Langan, spokesman for the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation.
Before they started the business, the two crop scouts covered fields on foot or with all-terrain vehicles.
When a problem is spotted from the air, the crop scout can go to the specific location for a closer look.
"What normally would take a couple of hours, in scouting time, can be done in minutes," said Chase Sellnow, a Landmark agronomist in Green County.

In the late 2000s, urchin fisherman Bruce Steele feared things were not going very well for the animals, and he had good reasons to think so.
But when he read a research paper about sea acidification, he saw right away what it could mean for his business, and for the ocean he loves.
Hofmann knew enough about genetic science to know that this distinction might prove important.
In Manchester, England, a common tree moth evolved from mostly speckled ivory color to black in just decades.
Near to the shore, for example, water moves around a lot and the levels of carbon dioxide in the water can vary at different times of day.
But in Southern California, the animals have experienced much less carbon dioxide.
They found that some of the animals started to adapt their bodies successfully to higher levels of carbon dioxide.
Marine biologist Gretchen Hofmann has a number of sea urchins wriggling in the tank in her laboratory.
Like the moths, Hofmann suspected that some urchins were better able to handle changes than others.
It all depends on the levels in the water the animals are used to.
Near to the shore, for example, water moves around a lot and the levels of carbon dioxide in the water can vary at different times of day.
So Hofmann and a co-worker mated "wimpy" Southern California sea urchins with "tougher" males from the north.
Like the moths, Hofmann suspected that some urchins were better able to handle changes than others.
So scientists are studying them to learn about how marine life will react to big changes in the ocean.

The rapid change is very dangerous for animals and fish that live under the waves.
They show how nature is amazing when it faces huge challenges.
She said that sea animals can change very quickly.
Not everything will make it, and some plants or animals will die out forever.
Body size is very important to sea urchins.
In Manchester two hundred years ago, there were lots of factories and the dirt from these buildings darkened the trees.
But the ivory moths were very easy to see on the dark tree trunks.
So the most common color of the moth changed from ivory to black.
They also found that some urchins had started to get used to higher levels of carbon dioxide.
And the sea is continuing to fill up with carbon dioxide.

After two years of arguments, protests and environmental analysis, hunters will arrive Friday at the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge in Florida to start killing alligators.
"These animals are harpooned, stabbed, or hooked and never die a quick or painless death.
The hunt is timed so that few if any visitors to the refuge will encounter any hunters, Olson said.
It will take place Friday and Saturday nights, with hunters allowed in an hour before sunset until an hour after sunrise.

North America\'s tallest bird, with a population of about 600, has lost three adults to gunfire in recent months, "senselessly" undercutting plans to breed a thriving population of the radiant white whooping crane, wildlife authorities say.
The deaths of the whooping cranes in Kentucky and Louisiana bring the number of intentional killings of the [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+birds) to at least 19 since 2001.
That exceeds the average number of cranes \u2014 13 \u2014 released into the wild each year by conservationists, according to Operation Migration.
The pair were the oldest pair among 33 whooping cranes in Louisiana.
In January, federal wildlife officials in Kentucky announced a $7,200 reward \u2014 later increased to $15,520 \u2014 for information about a whooping crane pair believed to be shot together in November.
In one case, a juvenile who admitted shooting a whooping crane was charged in Indiana state court with a misdemeanor and eventually fined $1, a punishment that rankled animal rights groups.
"It\'s unbelievably selfish."
But the steady number of unnatural deaths angers environmental advocates.

As a practical matter, no one can say how much an end-to-end ride on the bullet train would actually cost if and when the system becomes fully operational, a milestone the state expects to reach some time in 2028.
At that point, ticket pricing will be set in consultation with a private company hired by the California High-Speed Rail Authority to operate the system, said rail agency Chief Executive Jeff Morales.
A premium, same-day nonstop bullet train trip would cost more than $86.
The French bullet train from Paris to Lyon is often cited as a line that is profitable, but it has a fare of 52 cents a mile.
The authority expects to generate additional revenue from leasing its right-of-way to utilities, advertising and concession fees at stations.
"The train will lose money and require a subsidy," said Joseph Vranich, former president of the national High-Speed Rail Association.

The days of being able to purchase some cheap land in the country are gone.
Recognizing those obstacles, some states have created programs to provide the next generation of farmers with the skills and land needed to be economically competitive.
"If we don\'t help the young generation of farmers get on the land, retiring farmers will quickly run out of people to sell the land to, individuals who will continue to grow food on it and treat it as farmland," said Rippon-Butler.

Prabal Gurung opened his Sunday night show with the solemn and soothing chants of a chorus of Buddhist monks.
Designer Joseph Altuzarra turned to his Basque heritage for inspiration, and the results were beautiful.
But it ultimately added up to a group of sharp jackets, breezy dresses and intriguing proportions that attract the eye.
Other designers, however, struggled to blend inspiration with a finished garment that speaks with a unique voice.
And all in all, it was a fine collection but one that felt a bit overwhelmed by the premise that inspired it.
The collection was jarring in its styling \u2014 with models in ungainly black wigs and greased-up skin \u2014 and in its colors and proportions.
If this was inspired by a personal experience in Goa or in Marrakech or wherever, one hopes everyone has since recovered.

Piles of smoldering rubbish were left to bake in the sun on the streets of Beirut and its suburbs.
"It is a scandal, and what is even a bigger scandal is the politicians who don\'t feel the need to resign," said Paul Abi Rached, the head of the Lebanese Eco Movement.
Meanwhile, some people have taken to paying for private pickup truck owners to collect the garbage in front of their homes, who dump it at night in unknown locations.
The country has long lacked recycling services or even basic trash sorting, making the problem worse.
That has drawn warnings from the public works minister, who said the trash poses air safety risks because of smoke and birds flying over the pit.
The civil war in neighboring Syria and its 1.2 million-plus refugees now living in Lebanon have made the situation worse.
In typical Lebanese style, life has gone on, uninterrupted, but the situation may change as anger on the street mounts.
"Shame on them (politicians) and shame on us if we accept to live like this," businessman Antoine Samaha said.
Piles of trash began growing on streets, sidewalks and near building entrances.
"Every decent Lebanese should protest this situation."

As a result, the Air Force is offering a souped-up incentive package under something called the Aviator Retention Program, which was first rolled out in 1989.
There has been fighter pilot shortages in the past, but the competition promises to be fierce in the years to come as airlines hunt for young talent because of a surge in retirements.
Neither US Airways nor American Airlines, which are in the middle of merging, has hired pilots in more than a decade, and are now beginning a large-scale recruiting effort to fill spots.
US Airways and American are anticipating the retirement of more than 2,100 pilots within the next five years because of the mandatory retirement age of 65.
Currently, first officers are required to have only a commercial pilot certificate, which requires just 250 hours of flight time.
Dennis Prokopowicz, an assistant system chief pilot with Jet Blue Airways, said it will be difficult for civilian pilots to achieve that many hours, but much easier for military pilots.
The Air Force said part of the problem is finding and training new pilots.
Another logistics problem has emerged with the proliferation of drones, and the need for drone pilots.
Help wanted: At least 130 veteran military aviators for nine-year commitment to fly fighter jets.
Air Force pilots typically earn about $90,000 by the time they complete their 11th year.
It requires commercial co-pilots to have 1,500 hours of flying experience, the same as captains.

He gave her a tablet \u2014 not a sleek new iPad or a hand-me-down Samsung, but one specifically designed and marketed for little ones.
Children are also spending more time on these devices \u2014 15 minutes a day on average last year, up from five minutes in 2011.
Even traditional toy makers such as Mattel have entered the app industry.
And the company is taking the technology and entertainment relationship further with its next device, the DreamTab, which it built with DreamWorks Animation.
The tie-ins include animated interactive videos and games based on "Shrek," "Kung Fu Panda" and "Madagascar."
"But I don\'t want to deprive them of using the technology to educate themselves."
"Her eyes lit up when she opened it," said Stepka, 34, a Shakopee, Minn., father of three.
The company posted $200 million in sales last year.
Although his children certainly use them to have fun, he said, the most important thing to him is that they learn and stay safe while using the technology.
Companies such as LeapFrog, Toys R Us and Samsung also sell devices for youngsters.
Education-focused cable channel BabyFirstTV has unleashed 27 apps aimed at young children.
For example, it can teach kids how to draw and animate their favorite characters, create books and edit video.
The company makes tablets designed for kids ages 3 to 14.
"We were tired of giving our kids the iPad," he said.
The $269 DreamTab will be released in some stores this month.
"In a bigger school, children learn social skills and how to live in the real world," said Kotoe Arakawa, who teaches the younger children.

The divers called her Naia, for "water nymph," because they discovered her teenage remains in a dark, underwater cave in Mexico\'s Yucatan Peninsula.
They believe she was probably searching for water when she entered a dark, underground cave and then plummeted 100 feet into the massive chamber now called Hoyo Negro, or black hole.
The study is among a number of recent genetic findings that have radically altered the long and heated debate over how humans came to inhabit the New World.
Faced with stark differences of appearance between present-day Native Americans and ancient fossils, some archaeologists argued that the Americas were originally populated by people from Europe as well as Asia.
Penned in perhaps by vast ice sheets, these people probably evolved in isolation for thousands of years in a land between Siberia and Alaska that scientists call Beringia.
"For years archaeologists have been debating this transatlantic thing, and really it\'s been an enormous distraction," said Hoffecker, who did not participate in the Hoyo Negro study.
"These early skeletons are so rare we have to really get as much information as we can from them.
Initially, researchers hoped to leave the bones in place, in keeping with conventions concerning the preservation of underwater cultural remains.

So when divers discovered the remains of a teenage girl in a dark, underwater cave, they named her Naia, for "water nymph."
For thousands of years, their ancestors had lived in a land between Siberia and Alaska known as Beringia.
Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter testified Tuesday that he was essentially paid to play via his scholarship as the National Labor Relations Board opened a closely watched hearing on a bid to form what would be the first union for college athletes in U.S. history.
During August training, he said, players often start practice at 8 a.m. and finish at 10 p.m. "It\'s a job, there is no way around it \u2014 it\'s a job," said Colter, a 21-year-old senior whose college career is over.
He said chemistry was invariably offered at times that conflicted with football practice.
Devoting more time to academics at the expense of his football, he added, could result in the loss of a scholarship.
The university and its attorneys have repeatedly pointed out that Northwestern has one of the highest graduation rates for football teams in the country \u2014 with around 97 percent of players receiving degrees.
For now, the push is to unionize athletes at private schools, like Northwestern.

Colter characterized playing college football as a job.
He said schools make it clear to incoming players that athletics are more important than academics \u2014 that is, classwork.
During and before the football season, he said, they devote 40 to 50 hours a week to the game.

Along the state road south to Gallup, New Mexico, is a route called the Code Talker Highway in memory of Navajo soldiers in the U.S. Army.
During World War II, they used their native language as a code to transmit secret messages.
"We teach our kids to get that education and then to come back to the reservation and help their people, just like Chris did," said Art Huskey, 71, who stood outside the tribal council chambers.

The instructor was killed Aug. 25 while teaching a 9-year-old girl to fire an Uzi submachine gun at an Arizona range.
The Uzi the girl was shooting at Bullets and Burgers was on full automatic fire at the time of the accident.
There were no children present Thursday morning at the outdoor, desertlike facility, where marksmen fired toward a large ridge of dirt.
Arizona is one of 21 states with no law that keep guns away from children under 18, as long as there is adult supervision, said Lindsey Zwicker.
She is a staff attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
The law was passed after an 8-year-old Connecticut boy died at a Massachusetts gun expo in 2008 after he lost control of the Uzi he was firing.
Children have to be 10 or older and be under the supervision of a parent to shoot at the indoor range at all, Yeandle said.
At the range an instructor makes sure to stay behind the shooter for safety and to keep control of the gun.
The accidental death of an instructor at a shooting range has begun a national debate on whether children should fire high-powered weapons.
A gun is a tool, and like any tool \u2014 be it a circular saw or a kitchen knife \u2014 it requires proper instruction, he said.
"It was clear that she was a beginner, and you don\'t start a beginner in that type of firearm," said Jensen.

Centuries before Captain James Cook explored the South Pacific, Polynesian seafarers in canoes crossed vast swaths of water to colonize lonely islands from Samoa and New Zealand all the way to Hawaii.
Few such vessels have lasted long enough to be found, because wood is organic matter and decays quickly.
"It was one of those situations where it sort of took your breath away," said lead author Dilys Amanda Johns, a senior research fellow at the University of Auckland.
The New Zealand canoe also shares some design elements with a canoe found about 30 years ago on Huahine in the Society Islands.
Scientists have tried to understand the kinds of boats and sailing technology that would have allowed seafaring Polynesians to brave the waters and winds.
For example, based on their model, the winds favored sailing from central East Polynesia to New Zealand from 1140 to 1260, and travel to Easter Island from 1250 to 1280.
"We think Polynesians were really good sailors \u2026 we think they were able to sail down here with or without help."

Oreos may be as addictive as cocaine \u2014 for rats, anyway \u2014 according to a new study from Connecticut College.
"It may explain why some people can\'t resist these foods despite the fact that they know they are bad for them."
Honohan said she also wanted to use a product that was common in grocery stores.
In one experiment, rats were given Oreo cookies in one space and rice cakes in the other.
The rats spent far more time in the chamber where the Oreos had been than in the chamber where the rice cakes had been.
Again, the substances were removed and the rats were given the choice of which chamber to spend time in.
"Maybe we can approach obesity the same way we address people addicted to drugs, because neurologically, it\'s the same," she said.

"Just think: The speech, the exact words of it, are still looked at, thought about and dissected," said Michele Hamill of Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., where one of five copies of Lincoln\'s handwritten speech is on display through Nov. 23 in remembrance of its delivery on Nov. 19, 1863.
Lincoln wrote the Cornell copy a few days after the speech at the request of George Bancroft, a historian who wanted to make copies of the document to raise money for wounded soldiers.
Hamill said Lincoln used high-quality linen-based paper and special ink.
Bancroft was left with what at the time seemed to be a "piece of useless paper," Hamill said, but he held onto it and willed it to his grandson, a chemistry professor at Cornell University.

But the tiny crystal carries an outsize significance: It is evidence that by that point in its history, Earth had gone from a superheated ball of molten rock to a congealed surface eventually capable of supporting life.
"One of the main goals of the space program is to understand if there\'s life elsewhere in the universe," said John Valley, a University of Wisconsin professor who led the study, collaborating with scientists in Australia, Canada and Puerto Rico.
Jim Mattinson, a professor emeritus in the department of earth science at University of California, Santa Barbara, said zircons have been found previously that were about the same age as the one in the current paper, but the earlier discoveries were met with skepticism.
Scientists have theorized that one of the crucial early events occurred when an asteroid roughly the size of Mars struck a glancing blow to the Earth, vaporizing the mantle and crust.
But the tiny crystal carries an outsize significance: It is evidence that by that point in its history, Earth had gone from a superheated ball of molten rock to a congealed surface eventually capable of supporting life.
Skeptics, however, note that no fossils were found in the Greenland rock.
They point instead to 3.5 billion-year-old evidence of life found in rocks in Pilbara, Australia.
The new instrument, made in Wisconsin, is so sensitive that researchers were able to identify the atomic number and mass of each atom in the sample.
Scientists have theorized that one of the crucial early events occurred when an asteroid roughly the size of Mars struck a glancing blow to the Earth, vaporizing the mantle and crust.
The zircon, described in the journal Nature Geoscience, is about 4.4 billion years old and much smaller than a single grain of rice.

Stuck in a piece of sandstone, the zircon is about 4.4 billion years old and much smaller than a grain of rice.
But scientists have argued over the earliest rocks and first evidences of life for years.
The study shows "beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this grain is that old," said Samuel Bowring, an expert in the early history of the Earth.
Scientists have theorized that one of the critical early events occurred when an asteroid roughly the size of Mars hit the Earth, vaporizing the mantle and crust.
The enormous energy from the crash transformed the surfaces of the Earth and moon into oceans of rock that had turned to liquid by the heat of the crash.
At the center is the superhot core, which is surrounded by the mantle \u2014 the thick, middle layer of the earth.
Both later cooled.
Minerals also were formed as far back in history.
Yet, what makes zircon so valuable to scientists is its ability to endure.

Belen Sisa, who came to the United States from Argentina 15 years ago, says it is time to stop using "inhumane" language to describe the many immigrants who call America home.
Representative Joaquin Castro, a Democrat from Texas, introduced the bill, which is called the Correcting Hurtful and Alienating Names in Government Expression (CHANGE) Act, on Oct. 21.
When applying for a job, she said, an interviewer told her she is "technically \u2026 an alien" and asked if she was even allowed to apply for the job.
"Words matter," he said, especially when they are about an "issue as contentious as immigration."

When 6-year-old Sophie Levy peered into the cart of books, she instantly caught sight of her favorite book, "Happy Pig Day!"
The library hopes the book bike will increase outreach to the community by reaching nonusers, particularly on the south and west sides of Evanston, which have the lowest numbers of cardholders, Skwerski said.
Other possible adjustments include a shelf to display books, so that people can recognize the book bike from several feet away, a cover for the cart and a docking station to charge phones and electronic devices, she said.
The book bike hopes to stop by a local open-air market in the coming weeks and possibly local schools once the school year starts, Skwerski said.

It began as an irresistible story: a tiny, long-forgotten painting by a French master found at flea market in the West Virginia panhandle.
The back story was equally irresistible: Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir was at lunch in Paris by the Seine River in 1879 with his mistress when he grabbed a linen napkin and used it to paint her a keepsake.
Museum officials were surprised to learn it had once been displayed in their galleries, and even more shocked when they discovered that "On the Shore of the Seine" had been stolen off their walls in 1951.
Adding to the mystery was why the painting was not listed on the Art Loss Register, an international database for missing and stolen works.
But the company has said it will relinquish its claim and transfer the work to the museum, at no cost.
Fuqua, a former blackjack dealer at a casino who now teaches driving in Virginia, has indicated to the court that she intends to file a claim, even as questions swirl around her.
Now it is up to a judge in Virginia to decide who owns the painting.
The Baltimore Museum of Art is expected to make a strong case for ownership.
Wainstein, the owner of the auction house, spoke to Fuqua about the painting several months ago and thinks that she will file a claim.

More than 860 health workers were infected in the region and more than 500 died.
The WHO said Liberia\'s eradication of the virus was "a monumental achievement" in dealing with the most complex outbreak of the disease ever seen.
The incubation period for the virus is 21 days, and a country can be declared free of Ebola only after 42 days have passed.
As the disease peaked in Liberia in August and September, the number of cases was increasing rapidly, by 300 to 400 a week.
Patients often mistook their symptoms for typhoid or malaria.
Treatment facilities were swamped with cases, and patients often died in terrible circumstances at the gates of treatment centers.
In many cases, there was no room inside the overcrowded facilities to treat them safely.
In some cases, community members left bodies in the streets.
The lack of enough beds in treatment centers led to thousands of unnecessary deaths.
At one point, almost no beds for Ebola patients were available in any treatment facility in the country, the WHO said in its statement.
"It is a tribute to the government and people of Liberia that determination to defeat Ebola never wavered, courage never faltered.
The statement gave much credit to local volunteers, who worked in treatment centers, on burial teams or as ambulance drivers.
"We must not let down our guard until the entire region reaches and stays at zero Ebola cases," the statement said.
Flushed with pride after a spectacular showing at the costliest Olympics ever, Russia celebrated 17 days of sport-driven global unity with a farewell show on Sunday night.
The huge sum transformed Sochi from a decaying resort town on the Black Sea into a household name.
Under Putin, critics say it has gone backward on democracy, human rights and its treatment of gays.
"It\'s amazing what has happened here," Bach said a few hours before the ceremony.
As dusk fell, Russians and international visitors streamed into the stadium for the ceremony featuring the extinguishing of the Olympic flame.
There was, of course, also ballet, for which Russia is famous.
That represented a stunning turnaround from the 2010 Vancouver Games.
Not all of the headlines out of Sochi were about sport.
"Mourning on the one hand, but knowing what really is going on in your country, seeing your capital burning, and feeling this responsibility, and then winning the gold medal," he said, "this really stands out for me."

Nearly a mile underground in an abandoned gold mine, one of the most important quests in physics has so far come up empty in the search for the elusive substance known as dark matter, scientists announced Wednesday.
A detector attached to the International Space Station has so far failed to find any dark matter either.
Scientists involved in the experiment said it had eliminated some theoretical candidates for dark matter, and there are many more theoretical models to search for.
"It\'s ghost-like matter," McKinsey said.
About one-quarter of the cosmos is comprised of dark matter \u2014 five times that of the ordinary matter that makes up everything we see.
"We know there\'s stuff out there that is something else, and that makes these searches hugely important because we know we are missing most of the universe," said Neal Weiner, director of the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at New York University, who was not part of the search.

Nearly a mile underground in an abandoned gold mine, one of the most important quests in physics has so far come up empty in the search for the elusive substance known as dark matter, scientists announced Wednesday.
Dark matter was first proposed in the 1930s as a way to explain certain inconsistencies between how scientists expected the universe to act and how they saw it actually behaving.
The latest attempt to detect dark matter is happening nearly a mile underground in an abandoned gold mine.
A detector attached to the International Space Station also has so far failed to find any of the stuff.
The advantage of running the experiment underground is that some 4,800 feet of earth help screen out background radiation.
About one-quarter of the universe is comprised of dark matter \u2014 which is five times as much as the ordinary matter that makes up everything we see.
For decades, scientists have been searching for something they believe is a major part of the entire universe.
They do have a name for it, though: dark matter.

But chemistry students have begun the painstaking work of turning the huge collection of dyes, test swatches and documents, all donated by the Tennessee-based Eastman Chemical Company, into an online resource.
Likely users include chemists seeking new dyes for textiles and paper that are friendly to the environment; medical researchers interested in dyes for use in treating cancer, and even engineers trying to create more efficient solar panels by making them more effective at absorbing the energy from sunlight.
For cancer therapy, substances in the collection may turn out to perform well at tinting cancer cells so that surgeons can better see whether they have removed an entire tumor, Hinks said.
The students have only digitized about 1,000 of the dyes so far, and the rest are expected to take a couple of years, even with a small army of 20 undergraduate students working on the task during the school year, and half dozen or so in summer.
He learned how to invent while on the job.
For much of his career, he worked side by side with chemists who, unlike him, held doctorates, but he more than held his own, Witzeman said.
That information is then put into a database that can be searched by chemical compounds or fragments of compounds and by other attributes, such as how they perform when heated or exposed to light.
The students have only digitized about 1,000 of the dyes so far, and the rest are expected to take a couple of years, even with a small army of 20 undergraduate students working on the task during the school year, and half dozen or so in summer.
Some are powders, some tiny crystals or nuggets.
For now, it consists mainly of 98,000 glass vials and slim envelopes containing cloth samples.
Such tinting would allow surgeons to better see whether they have removed an entire tumor.
Other surgeons might dye cancer cells, then kill those cells by aiming lasers at them.
Undergraduate students have begun digitizing information about each dye molecule.
The rest are expected to take a couple of years, even with a small army of 20 undergraduate students working on the task during the school year, and half a dozen or so in summer.
Eventually, however, other chemical companies will be asked to donate dyes as well.
The library also will be open to other kinds of researchers.
It is expected to become an important tool for scientists working in many different fields.
There are so many dyes, Hinks said, that the university gave up on counting all of them.
It was Weaver who created the single largest portion of the dye library.
Visitors to the online library will be able to search thousands of three-dimensional models.
A molecule is the smallest part of something that still contains everything that makes that thing what it is.
However, more than a dozen other scientists also contributed.
To their surprise, they found that roughly 5 percent of the people they studied reported getting no pleasure at all from music.
So they followed up by testing 30 more people, grouped by their relative liking for music.
This rates such things as music-seeking behavior, use of music to regulate mood, whether music was a shared social experience, and other factors.
Besides some Beethoven and the themes to "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Superman," the musically indifferent chose the Verve, Franz Ferdinand and Moby.
Besides some Beethoven and the themes to "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Superman," the musically indifferent chose the Verve, Franz Ferdinand and Moby.
Everyone dislikes some kind of music.
The finding was made by a team of researchers from Spain and Canada.
These people felt little emotion even when they listened to music they had chosen themselves.
"They were not just saying so," said the study\'s co-author, Josep Marco Pallares, a psychologist who studies the brain and human behavior.
None of the participants showed signs of general anhedonia.
Subjects were also asked to bring in several pieces of their own choice, Marco said.
Artists with more than one cut included Carlos Santana, Paco de Lucia and Beethoven.
"I would say it was less typical," Marco said of the mix brought in by the hyper-hedonic people.
Besides some Beethoven and the themes to "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Superman," the group less moved by music chose music by the Verve, Franz Ferdinand and Moby.
After the hell of World War II, the Federal Republic of Germany \u2014 commonly known as West Germany \u2014 got massive help with its debt from former foes.
Development activists cite that case when arguing for easier terms for troubled countries today.
Yale University Professor Timothy Guinnane warns against making too many comparisons, partly because Germany was so much more important geopolitically than Greece today.
"It was a hard-nosed decision ..... it\'s wrong to say it was an act of generosity."
Cyprus has said it could consider writing off 330 million euros ($370 million) in rescue loans to Greece.
The U.S., while not directly involved, has consistently advocated debt relief.
It blamed the current government for being slow on reforms and privatizations, but said it was clear the debt needed to be made more manageable.
Forgiving debt, if done right, can get an economy back on its feet.
"Greece needs a sort of breathing space," the IMF official said.
Forgiving debt, if done right, can get an economy back on its feet.
A new report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) argues that Greece should get help.
Greece now owes more than $332 billion to other countries.
The world was in chaos and the U.S. wanted Germany to be strong again to help stop the spread of communism to Western Europe from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
Germany also had economic power then than Greece has now.
Unlike Germany, Greece has had to pay its debt even though it has not had enough money because its economy is in bad shape.
WASHINGTON \u2013 Walkouts and protests by fast-food workers demanding higher wages and collective bargaining rights began last November and spread to 60 cities nationwide at the end of August.
And that is a result of deliberate "reforms," including: The weakening of labor unions through changes in and non-enforcement of labor law; International "trade" agreements that put most workers but not higher-paid professionals into more serious competition with lower-wage labor abroad; And many other policy changes that redistribute income upward.
This kind of mass organizing around domestic economic issues has not been seen for a long time, perhaps since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Then we might begin to reverse some of the wrongs here at home too.

North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey called the shooting death "a horrible tragedy."
At first, Slager, 33, said that during the confrontation Saturday morning, Scott had taken his Taser, a weapon that delivers an electrical shock, and ran with it.
They demanded that Driggers answer questions about the investigation, which is being handled by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED).
The North Charleston department ordered additional body cameras Wednesday morning, which would add to the 115 cameras the department already owns.
Officers will wear the small cameras, which will record all their actions.

Police Chief Eddie Driggers said Wednesday that he was "sickened" by the video.
Michael Brown was an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Missouri, who was shot and killed by a white police officer over the summer.
However, they stressed that demonstrations must remain peaceful.
"As the mayor said, right is right and wrong is wrong," Sanford said.
A South Carolina mayor announced that all patrol officers will wear body cameras after a local police officer was filmed shooting an unarmed man.
Driggers added, "I have been praying for peace for the family and peace for the community."
Michael Thomas Slager, a former North Charleston police officer, was arrested and charged with murder Tuesday.
He has also been fired from the police force.
North Charleston Police Chief Eddie Driggers said Wednesday that he was "sickened" by the video.
During Wednesday\'s news conference, protesters interrupted officials with chants of "No justice!
They are "a wonderful, down-to-earth family, a wonderful group of people, and we let them know how we felt about their loss and how bad it was," Summey said.
However, Summey cautioned that it could take some time before officers would wear them on patrols.
This was the 11th time an officer has shot someone in South Carolina this year, said Thom Berry, a SLED spokesman.

While the two organizations mirror each other in many ways, there are some significant differences.
"Twenty-five percent of younger boys experience some sense of gender confusion or sexuality fluidity and we will help guide him in a way that affirms his God-given physical biology," said Trail Life board chairman John Stemberger, an Orlando attorney and Eagle Scout who fought the inclusion of gay scouts.
Stephens views Trail Life as a desperate and futile escape to a past that no longer exists.
In an organizational meeting held in Nashville, Tenn., this month, Trail Life attracted about 1,200 adult leaders from 44 states.
That decision led to the creation of American Heritage Girls, which now has more than 20,000 members, compared with 2.3 million Girl Scouts.
Since the decision was announced in May, the seven-county district has added 2,000 new families, and expects to attract 6,500 by the end of October, said Bill Gosselin, director of operations.
"I\'m glad I am building something my son can enjoy from next year to when he\'s 18," said Collier, a 41-year-old utilities field manager from Windermere.

Nearly $1 out of every $5 spent on cookies in the United States is used to buy Oreos.
This year, the Oreo brand sold more than 1 1/2 times as many cookies as it did just 10 years ago.
About 5 of every 100 cookies sold worldwide are Oreos.

Wedged behind an exhaust-belching bus and ahead of a honking car, Luis Enrique Neira urges his scrawny horse Pagatodo through a busy intersection.
Neira has been a horse-cart driver, or a zorrero, since he was 12 years old, eking out a living hauling loads and sometimes recycling scrap metal and cardboard.
Bogota is requiring them to trade in their horse and carts for small four-wheel vehicles.
Despite her precarious economic state, Garzon said she thinks the program is positive.
The negative perception surrounding the horse-cart drivers was one of the problems in finding a sustainable solution, said Ricardo Mora, the Latin American program manager for the World Society for the Protection of Animals, which worked with the city on the project.
And while images of scrawny and mistreated horses gallop across social networks, the vast majority of zorreros treat their animals with care.
"Some of the horses do live in very precarious conditions but so do the owners," Mora said.
"I\'ve been a zorrero all my life and, thank God, I\'ve always made enough money to put some yucca in my soup," said Neira, 51, who supports his wife, three children and five grandchildren.
Bogota has been the home to working animals since before colonial times.
But in those cities the animals are usually relegated to rural outskirts.
In Bogota, horse carts are part of the urban landscape \u2014 snarling traffic and keeping pedestrians alert for horse droppings.
Successive city governments have been trying to get them off the streets for at least 50 years, Rodriguez said.
But recent bypass surgery and bouts of hypoglycemia make her scared of driving a motorized vehicle.

But four centuries of domestication has likely weakened the species.
So in the 1950s, a scientist hoping to produce a tougher tropical bee tried breeding South African bees with European bees in Brazil.
But a day after he set up the hives, their dad, Ross Toyne, said he got a citation from Coral Gables code enforcement.
"The big question is how long can this go on," he said.
Bees are tidy and obsessively orderly, grooming one another and lining hives with a sticky glue loaded with antibiotics.
With the help of a beekeeping cousin, they persuaded their parents to start keeping hives.
But a day after he set up the hives, their dad, Ross Toyne, said he got a citation from Coral Gables code enforcement.
The Florida woman found herself in the middle of a swarming legal fight between Miami-Dade County and the state over the buzzing honeybees in her yard.
The parties were sparring over the legality of backyard beekeeping.
The county imposes strict limits on the numbers and locations of private beehives.
The state, however, does not maintain the same policies.
The decision was a victory for Davis and other hobbyist beekeepers in Florida, but a small one in the larger war to save the honeybee.
Over the past decade, bees have fallen victim to both natural and man-made dangers including disease, extreme weather, pesticides, invasions of other species and development that destroys habitats.
Large swaths of single crops, called monocultures, also pose challenges for pollinating creatures, including bees.
Longtime beekeepers, or apiarists, call these new hobbyists "wannabees."
Today his Homestead house serves as his production plant.
Luckily for the twins, their father is an attorney.
He was able to take a stand and resolve the issue with the county.
Toyne also helped Davis as she navigated her own thorny legal issues.
But Nolan warned that the problems of disease and shrinking habitat still loom.
Marcie Davis wanted to build a honeybee hive in her backyard in Florida.
Davis had to go to court if she wanted to keep her beehives.

They assigned each song to one of 13 style groups, based on the patterns they found.
To double-check their classifications, they looked at how users of Last.fm, an online music discovery service, had labeled the tracks.
Songs that the algorithms classified as Style 2, for example, had received Last.fm tags such as "hip-hop," "rap" and "old school."
Songs computer-sorted into Style 8 had been described by listeners as "new wave," "dance" and "electronic."
The U.S. Supreme Court handed a major victory to supporters of gay marriage on Wednesday, striking down part of a federal law that would have prevented same-sex couples from getting federal benefits.
A state trial court threw out the law.
Ironically, Kennedy was on the dissenting side in the California case.
The U.S. Supreme Court handed a major victory to supporters of gay marriage on Wednesday, striking down part of a federal law that would have prevented same-sex couples from getting federal benefits.
The case was brought by Edith Windsor, who married Thea Spyer in Canada in 2007.
Kris Perry, one of the plaintiffs in the California case, cheered the decision from the Supreme Court steps.
She and her partner would be able to tell their four sons "you\'re just as good as everybody else, no matter who you love, no matter who your parents love."

Lynda Walsh, a court-appointed advocate for children from Delray Beach, Florida, wants kids to look fashionable no matter how tight of a budget they are on.
Cool Clothes, a storefront, is set up like a boutique with clothes hanging on racks and folded in dressers for both males and females sizes extra small to triple extra large.
Before she moved to Florida in 2000, she was as a court stenographer in Chicago, where she worked in the juvenile court system.
Walsh said she has a special place in her heart for the older children, who are aging out of the foster care system, and gearing up to start new chapters of their lives as adults.
She makes sure the Closet is stocked with professional clothing available for any potential job interviews.
To let people know the boutique is open, she is spending time reaching out to local schools, churches and after-school care programs.

Incidents of sick and injured dairy cows being slapped, poked and forced to their feet with heavy machinery \u2014 while not common \u2014 may not be that unusual, according to farmers and others who viewed an undercover video this week from the Wiese Brothers Farm in Brown County, Wis.
Sometimes you can sneak up behind a downed cow, scream at it, and scare the animal into getting back on its feet, said Paul Rozadowski, a dairy farmer from Stanley.
Wisconsin dairy industry leaders have depicted the practices shown in the video as shocking, cruel and not typical of the industry.
Instead, he pokes the cow with an old ink pen to stimulate it into moving.
A well-run dairy farm would never tolerate such things, Grandin said in an interview.
Until the video was released, Wiese Brothers Farm was a milk supplier for Baraboo-based cooperative Foremost Farms and Nestle USA, which makes DiGiorno frozen pizzas.
After the release, Nestle and Foremost quickly severed ties with the farm.
Wednesday, Mercy for Animals said it was seeking talks with Nestle to try and convince the company to adopt anti-cruelty guidelines for its milk suppliers.

Many have noted the historical parallels between the current debate over Syrians seeking refuge in the United States and the plight of European Jews fleeing German-occupied territories on the eve of World War II.
The moment the Franks and their American supporters overcame one administrative or logistical obstacle, another arose."
By 1941, the Frank family had already relocated from Germany to the Netherlands where, just a few years earlier, Otto Frank applied for visas to the United States -- applications that were eventually destroyed, Frank wrote in a letter to his old college friend in the United States, Nathan Straus Jr. "I am forced to look out for emigration and as far as I can see U.S.A. is the only country we could go to," Frank wrote on April 30, 1941.
The American government was making it harder for foreigners to get into the country -- and the Nazis were making it difficult to leave.
By early 1939, more than 300,000 names were on the waiting list to receive an immigration visa to the United States, Breitman wrote.
The Frank family went into hiding in 1942, a day after Margot Frank received a Nazi order to go east to a labor camp and a month after Anne Frank received a diary for her 13th birthday.
Many have noted the historical parallels between the current debate over Syrians seeking refuge in the United States and the plight of European Jews fleeing German-occupied territories on the eve of World War II.

Born in the dirt, the humble white potato has lately been elevated to the main dish in a rollicking debate that is blurring the lines between politics and science.
Rather, the nonpartisan Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences, determined that the women and children in the WIC population of 8.7 million already eat enough white potatoes \u2014 or nearly enough.
Saying that the exclusion makes potatoes look unhealthy, the National Potato Council has been lobbying members of Congress \u2014 Democrats and Republicans, many of them from potato-growing states \u2014 to speak out.
Mark Szymanski, spokesman for the council, said the group was "encouraging Congress to reverse a policy not founded in good nutritional science or common sense.
"We strongly urge you to oppose efforts to intervene in science-based rules regarding the federal child nutrition programs," the organizations wrote last month.
Last Tuesday, around 100 pediatricians went to Capitol Hill to urge their representatives to back away from potatoes.
Advocates for the poor said they cannot countenance what they see as congressional overreach.

Meanwhile, nearly 100 health and science organizations have joined to ask Congress to stay out of scientific matters.
"The National Potato Council has declared war on WIC," said the Reverend Douglas Greenaway, president of WIC.
Campaigners on behalf of the poor say Congress is going too far.
The government is pushing hard to get the potato included in the WIC program.
WIC provides food to poor mothers and their young children.
These foods are the ones considered the healthiest for pregnant women and young children.
The council has been pushing members of Congress to speak out.
This same group, with the help of Congress, took on President Obama in 2011 when he wanted to limit potatoes in school lunches.
The decision to leave out the potato, he says, is not based on good "science or common sense."
Last Tuesday, around 100 doctors went to Washington, D.C.
What makes it worse, she added, is that Congress is doing it to help potato growers, not mothers and children.

The tension between the two Manley High School students started on Facebook, with a wall post that asked a direct, but loaded, question.
By the time Marquita Riley, 16, and Aaliyah Hudson, 17, ended up in their school\'s "peace room," rumors had floated through the halls that the two girls were going to brawl.
"That way, \'cause if anything did happen, it wouldn\'t be my bad.
The philosophy aims to bring together victims and perpetrators to cooperatively work through their problems.
It is also being used as an alternative to punitive measures, like suspensions and arrests, which can lead to more trouble for hurting communities.
The idea is that "when harm happens or someone misbehaves, there needs to be a process of restoration in order for the community to move forward," said Ilana Zafran of Umoja Student Development.
City authorities are grappling with shootings and killings among youths.
This idea of restoration is not something even adults do well because it can be messy and complicated and involves vulnerability, and that is just hard."
Still, restorative justice is a tactic worth trying, experts say.
His ministry applies the philosophy when working with troubled youths.
At Manley High and Fenger Academy in Chicago, administrators have created peace rooms where students and workers can retreat to work out problems.
Before she started high school, Geneva Harris, 18, said she was the type of kid who called others names, gave cutting responses and oozed sassy attitude.
"People came up to me and said you wanted to fight me," Marquita, a sophomore, told Aaliyah.

Looking like the girl in the red coat from the movie "Schindler\'s List," Julia Lipnitskaia stepped onto the Olympic ice Sunday.
Lipnitskaia had already announced her arrival with a spellbinding short program in the inaugural team competition Saturday night.
This time, it looks like the Russian team is loaded in all disciplines.
Known for his soaring jumps, power, and his charisma (some would say preening), the 31-year-old had the crowd in the palm of his hand.
He was a controversial pick to the Olympic team because of his injury troubles last year, but he proved he can still jump \u2013 though he was limping a bit afterward and said his back was not 100 percent.
Lipnitskaia admitted she was apprehensive about skating after Plushenko.

Some seven millennia ago or more, a group of people called the Chinchorro lived along the coasts of northern Chile and southern Peru.
"Whereas the Egyptians considered only kings and other exalted citizens worthy of mummification, the Chinchorro accorded everyone in the community, regardless of age or status, this sacred rite," wrote Bernardo Arriaza, an expert on the mummies, which were first discovered in the Atacama desert in 1917.
"Everybody say(s) that here," she averred.
Indeed, weather historian Christopher Burt wrote about Arica in 2013, noting that despite its famous reputation for dryness, weather records from 1971 to 2000 suggest that lately it has been somewhat wetter than usual.
Mitchell noted that many of the mummies, found in the 1980s, had no problems until 10 years ago, "when they started to deteriorate."
Their hypothesis was that, in effect, more airborne moisture had enabled bacteria to start to chow down on the ancient relics.
The result, said Mitchell, was the finding that what he calls bacterial "opportunists" were taking advantage of a more humid environment to "use the skin as a nutrient and start to break it down."
It\'s something that the UNESCO World Heritage Center has been attentive to for some time; a 2007 report from the U.N. agency noted that "the impacts of climate change are affecting many World Heritage properties and are likely to affect many more, both natural and cultural, in the years ahead."
The U.S. Agency for International Development is also concerned about how climate change can affect world heritage sites \u2014 and it highlights an example that on a physical level sounds similar to what appears to be happening in Arica.
"Buildings in the rare medieval city of Leh in Ladakh, India, were constructed in a high altitude desert environment and are ill suited to current increases in precipitation," it notes.
Several years back, Archaeology magazine listed yet another related example, noting that the frozen burial mounds of Scythian warlords (called "kurgans"), preserved in permafrost near Siberia, can be destabilized by Arctic thawing.
In this case, it was ice, rather than desert, that had preserved remains intact for a magnificently long time \u2014 but a change in climate can once again mean an irreplaceable loss of artifacts and ruins.

"Buildings in the rare medieval city of Leh in Ladakh, India, were constructed in a high altitude desert environment and are ill suited to current increases in precipitation," it notes.
Many of these sites have been remarkably preserved precisely because of the fact that they have been climatically unperturbed.
Some seven millennia ago or more, a group of people called the Chinchorro lived along the coasts of northern Chile and southern Peru.
The Chinchorro were unique in many ways, but perhaps most of all in their burial practices.
Alter that, and, along with many other consequences, the world could lose some of its history.
About 7,000 years ago or more, a group of people called the Chinchorro lived along the coasts of northern Chile and southern Peru.
Their lives revolved around fishing from the rich Pacific waters.
"Whereas the Egyptians considered only kings and other exalted citizens worthy of mummification, the Chinchorro accorded everyone in the community, regardless of age or status, this sacred rite," wrote Bernardo Arriaza, an expert on the mummies.
Scientists blame some of these changes on humans burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal.
This may not be a change that can be definitively blamed on global climate change caused by humans, cautioned Ralph Mitchell, a Harvard University microbiologist.
They studied samples of mummy skin and dried pig skin in various conditions.
The result, Mitchell said, was the finding that bacteria were taking advantage of a more humid environment to "use the skin as a nutrient and start to break it down."
The decaying of the Chinchorro mummies illustrates just how vulnerable many irreplaceable cultural artifacts and World Heritage sites may be to a changing climate \u2014 human-caused or not.
Its department UNESCO names certain places as World Heritage sites because of their importance to nature or culture.

"As a space-faring country it has been more than 40 years since we have been to deep space," out where asteroids lurk, said Stanford University aeronautics professor G. Scott Hubbard, who conceived the Mars Pathfinder mission and formerly directed NASA Ames.
The "Asteroid Retrieval Mission" is still under development in Washington, D.C., where it is a major new goal for an agency that has retired the shuttle fleet and grounded a moon-landing plan.
Asteroids are the rubble left from the formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago and hold clues about our origins and, perhaps, valuable metals.
Scheming to rearrange the heavens, scientists are busy planning how to pluck, push and park a spinning asteroid between here and the moon.
"Our goal is to go out there and rendezvous \u2014 then get it into the hands of the people who can understand it," said David Korsmeyer, director of the Engineering Directorate at Mountain View, Calif.\'s NASA Ames Research Center, which will contribute to the project.

Now, a researcher from Macquarie University in Australia has published a study examining recent extinctions within two vulnerable groups of animals - reptiles and amphibians - and the results are cause for alarm.
He found that frogs seemed to be the most vulnerable to extinction - the results suggested that more than 3 percent of all frog species have disappeared, largely since the 1970s.
"Thus, the data suggest that a runaway train of extinction is now likely to produce what would be seen as a global mass extinction on the ultimately more important landscape of geological time," Alroy writes in the paper.
To put those numbers in context, the data suggest that extinction rates for reptiles and amphibians are about 10,000 times larger than the rates for all other organisms.
"I found a much smaller proportional number of extinctions for snakes and lizards - half as much, nominally," Alroy said.
And while climate change is likely to be an important factor in the coming years "this paper suggests that in the absence of really severe climate change we\'ve already seen the beginning of a major mass extinction."
So I\'m hoping this paper will encourage more research of that kind."
Now, a researcher from Macquarie University in Australia has published a study examining recent extinctions within two vulnerable groups of animals - reptiles and amphibians - and the results are cause for alarm.
For instance, some places with high rates of extinction were also known hotspots for the fungus, while others had no documentation of the fungus ever being present.

Now, a researcher from Macquarie University in Australia has published a study examining recent extinctions within two disappearing groups of animals \u2014 reptiles and amphibians.
Alroy estimated the probability of past extinctions for certain types of amphibians and reptiles, including frogs, salamanders, snakes and lizards.
The results suggested that more than 3 percent of all frog species have disappeared, largely since the 1970s.
The study also shows that about 200 frog species have gone extinct and hundreds more will be lost over the next century.
Then scientists might be able to start taking action to save the frogs.
So he\'s "hoping this paper will encourage more research of that kind."
This fall, about 57,000 children will be denied a place in Head Start and Early Head Start as fallout from sequestration.
Yasmina Vinci, executive director of the National Head Start Association, said sequestration represented the largest hit to Head Start funding in terms of dollars since the program began in 1965.
"I think it\'s going to be devastating for families who were hoping that for a year or two before their children got into kindergarten that they would be able to participate in preschool," said Cheryl Miller, executive director of the Indiana Head Start Association.
As executive director of Knox County Head Start in Ohio, Peg Tazewell opted to increase class sizes from 16 or 17 students to about 20 rather than reduce the number of spots for children.
Some of the children will now have to ride the bus as far as 20 miles.
The average income for a family of four in her program last year was about $13,000 a year, she said.
Ruiz, who is herself a graduate of Head Start, wanted her daughter to be in the program because of the experience of her older daughter, who is now 4.
There are few children in their neighborhood in Pikes Peak Park, where people from other parts of town are afraid to go "because they think they\'ll get shot in a drive-by," Ruiz said.
Now, after a year in Head Start, her daughter is much more social and has learned how to write her name and count to 20.

Early Head Start supports the families of infants and pregnant women.
In Indiana, at least two Head Start programs used lotteries to decide which preschoolers had to stop attending in March.
Ruiz eventually learned that both girls would have spots in the coming school year.
Head Start directors across the country have struggled to find ways to cut costs without reducing the number of children they serve.

His legacy, though, is being preserved digitally.
A devoted group of scholars and Roosevelt admirers has been scanning his papers and artifacts for years and is finishing a design for a library and museum commemorating the life of the 26th president.
The physical library is expected to open in 2019 in Dickinson, a city of about 20,000 residents about 35 miles east of Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota, which includes ranchland that was once his.
However, the library has already made thousands of notes, letters and photographs available online.
"And I think that\'s an interesting phenomenon; it\'s a very 21st-century idea," said Daniel Stowell, the director and editor of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln who also sits on the advisory board for the unbuilt Roosevelt library.
He explained, "By having a traditional exhibit with a station where people could actually look up more in-depth information related to something that catches their interest, it tailors the exhibit to individual visitors, because they are in control of the information they\'re accessing."
He established the Elkhorn Ranch, which sits along the Little Missouri River about 25 miles east of the Montana border.
Organizers hope that learning about Roosevelt\'s life and experiencing first-hand the raw beauty he saw in the badlands will present visitors with the complete picture of the man in the place that\'s often called the "cradle of conservation," and would lead the former president to write: "It was here that the romance of my life began."

Any library for a president who served before Hoover must be built and managed without the help of the federal government.
The university, which is spearheading the library project, hopes to include hundreds of thousands more documents in the growing collection.
Stowell also sits on the advisory board for the as-yet unbuilt Roosevelt library.
The digital records will be drawn from sources ranging Harvard and the Library of Congress to private collections.
The area, often called the "cradle of conservation," would lead the former president to write, "It was here that the romance of my life began."
The National Archives in Washington, D.C., oversees all presidential libraries from Herbert Hoover, the 31st president, on.
Scholars hope its digital collection will eventually include every Roosevelt-related item they can find.
"And I think that\'s an interesting phenomenon; it\'s a very 21st-century idea," said Daniel Stowell, the director and editor of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln.
In time, it will slowly collect more physical objects for the actual museum.
He said he expects Roosevelt\'s library to look "like the Gilded Age, but updated with computers."
The teddy bear was named for Roosevelt after he refused to shoot an old black bear in Mississippi.
The idea that humans will eventually travel to and inhabit other parts of our galaxy was well expressed by the early Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who wrote, "Earth is humanity\'s cradle, but you\'re not meant to stay in your cradle forever."
Instead of a spaceship, we would have to create some kind of space-traveling ark, big enough to support a community of humans and other plants and animals in a fully recycling ecological system.
Any starfaring ark would therefore be an experiment, its inhabitants lab animals.
But history has shown that people tend to react poorly in rigid states and social systems.
Add to these social constraints permanent enclosure, exile from the planetary surface we evolved on, and the probability of health problems, and the possibility for psychological difficulties and mental illnesses seems quite high.
If there is indigenous life, the problems of living in contact with an alien biology could range from innocuous to fatal, but will surely require careful investigation.
On the other hand, if the planetary body is inert, then the newcomers will have to terraform it using only local resources and the power they have brought with them.
This means the process will have a slow start, and take on the order of centuries, during which time the ark, or its equivalent on the alien planet, would have to continue to function without failures.
The idea that humans will eventually travel to and inhabit other parts of our galaxy was well expressed by the early Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who wrote, "Earth is humanity\'s cradle, but you\'re not meant to stay in your cradle forever."

The early Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky wrote\xa0that humans will eventually travel to and inhabit other parts of our galaxy.\xa0He said, "Earth is humanity\'s cradle, but you\'re not meant to stay in your cradle forever."

Rules would have to be enforced to keep all aspects of the experiment functioning.
History has shown that people tend to react poorly in rigid states and social systems.
If there is life, the problems of living in contact with an alien environment could range from harmless to fatal, but will surely require careful investigation.
First, there would need to be a sustainable human civilization on Earth itself to teach us many of the things we would need to know to construct a workable ark.
Second, there\xa0would need\xa0to be a great deal of practice in an ark orbiting our sun, where we could\xa0make repairs and study the ark.
Two St. Louis County police officers were shot outside the Ferguson Police Department during another night of protests in the troubled Missouri city, police confirmed early Thursday.
An officer from the St. Louis County Police Department, 41 years old and a 14-year veteran, was shot in the shoulder, and an officer from the Webster Groves Police Department, 32, was shot in the face, he said.
There is too much violence in our city and this crisis of trust makes us all less safe," St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has played a prominent role in the Ferguson protests, said on Twitter.

There is too much violence in our city and this crisis of trust makes us all less safe," St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, who has played a prominent role in the Ferguson protests, said on Twitter.
Several witnesses told the Los Angeles Times that the shots appeared to come from a hill beyond where protesters had gathered.
About 50 protesters were in the parking lot of a tire store while police in riot gear were gathered in the parking lot of the police station across the street.
A video captured from a live stream of the events shows the protesters and the police standing idly when shots rang out.
Screams and profanities could be heard before the camera operator apparently began running.
"It was the first time I\'d heard a bullet whiz and pass my head," Rice said, adding that several officers dropped their riot shields to take cover.
Mike Kinman, 46, an Episcopal priest, had just arrived at the protest five minutes before the shots were fired.
Two St. Louis County police officers were shot outside the Ferguson Police Department during another night of protests in the troubled Missouri city, police confirmed early Thursday.
"They were way up the hill" and concealed in the dark, he said.
St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said two officers were hospitalized after the shooting, which occurred outside the Ferguson Police Department.
More demonstrations erupted when a grand jury elected not to put the white officer, Darren Wilson, on trial for murder.
The Justice Department also cleared Wilson, who has since left the department, of any civil rights charges \u2014 that is, it said his actions were not motivated by racism.
There is too much violence in our city and this crisis of trust makes us all less safe," said St. Louis political leader Antonio French on Twitter.
Suddenly, several shots were fired, said Heather De Mian, who was recording the events on a live video stream.
On Thursday, two police officers were shot during a night of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, police have confirmed.
Officer Wilson claimed he shot Brown after the young man tried to grab his gun.
He said "the shots definitely came up from behind us, up the street \u2014 it definitely did not come from the protesters."
On Thursday, two police officers were shot during a night of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, which has been troubled since the killing of Michael Brown last summer.
The shooting occurred outside the Ferguson Police Department.
The stabilizers pull down on the rope, and the bend becomes steeper," Troffer said.
On Marina City, the wire was tied to existing steel bolts that formerly anchored television towers.
When designing the tightrope, Troffer said he figured out how much tension could be placed on the wire without breaking the anchors.
Millions watched on television last Sunday as Nik Wallenda set the world record for highest incline tightrope walk in Chicago.
"Full protection under the Endangered Species Act is long overdue for chimpanzees, our closest living relatives," Pippin said.
In its proposal, the Fish and Wildlife Service noted that while some biomedical research on captive chimpanzees continues in the U.S., "there is a decreasing scientific need for chimpanzee studies due to the emergence of non-chimpanzee models and technologies."
"Chimpanzees have repeatedly proven to be poor models for many areas of human disease research, such as HIV, malaria and other infectious diseases, neuroscience research and cancer," Pippin said.
Animal rights groups cheered the move.
The Federal government plans to give more protection to chimpanzees by changing their endangered status and shielding them from experiments.
In early 2011, Ajit Varki of the University of California-San Diego found that chimps and humans experienced disease differently.
The latest estimates put their worldwide population at 300,000 to 430,000.
Knowledge once gained only by examining a live animal now can be learned in a petri dish.
The Federal government plans to give more protection to chimpanzees by changing their endangered status and shielding them from experiments.
Right now, only wild chimpanzees are listed as endangered.
The researchers hoped doing so would lead to a cure, treatment or both.
But only one developed an AIDS-like disease, and died.
An article in the British Medical Journal concluded: "When it comes to testing HIV vaccines, only humans will do."
The latest count put the worldwide population of chimps at 300,000 to 430,000.
But the service said such research will be limited.
Only studies that are helpful to the chimpanzee species will be allowed.
People have argued about the use chimpanzees in science for years.
When it comes to studying human diseases, the primates just make bad test subjects, said Dr. John J. Pippin of the group Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, who applauded the move.
In Andreolepis, only the scales showed signs of enamel.
Teeth are covered by a thin layer of enamel, a hard substance that protects them from wear and tear.
Some bony fishes, such as the North American gar (also known as Lepisosteus), have scales that are covered with ganoine.
The new study, authored by Per Ahlberg at Uppsala University in Sweden, takes a closer look at ganoine, and shines new light on the evolutionary origins of enamel.
Genomics is the study of genetic information stored in DNA.
They examined the Psarolepis from China and the Andreolepis from Sweden, two fish that are more than 400 million years old.
It suggests that enamel most likely did not originate in teeth.

Then, on Jan. 20, alarm clocks on the craft woke it up to prepare it for landing.
ESA confirmed Wednesday that those harpoons did not deploy.
Agency officials said the lander was still in great shape and they were looking for ways to refire the harpoons.
Mark Bentley, a scientist with the Austrian Academy of Sciences and a lead investigator on the Rosetta project, tweeted Wednesday that deciding whether to refire the harpoons is "tricky."
Because the comet has such low gravity, it is possible that firing the harpoons could produce recoil that might push Philae off the comet.
Once it landed, Philae sent a message to the Rosetta orbiter to let it know where it had ended up.
From there, Rosetta relayed the information to Earth.
Scientists had warned that there was a very real chance that the Philae landing would fail.
For the first time in history, humans have successfully landed a spacecraft on a comet.
The data took 28 minutes to cross 300 million miles of space.
Scientists from the European Space Agency (ESA) made history this week: they successfully landed a spacecraft on a comet for the first time.
This could become a problem, as fewer people will know things about plants in the future.
An example of what botanists do happened recently in a clearing on the side of a highway in Arkansas.
It is called the Missouri bladderpod.
He worried about what would happen as people with the jobs get older and stop working.
Understanding plants and what they are made of, or their biology, is important, said Joe Miller.
Scientists know that the collections of plants can be hard to take care of.
The University of Missouri announced May 18 that it would give its collection to the Missouri Botanical Garden.
The University of Arkansas at Fayetteville collection was almost closed in 2003 and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock closed its collection a few years later.
They have been collecting more than 70,000 different types of plants.
The flags were torn down while defeated cities still burned, even as citizens crawling from the rubble were just realizing that the governments they represented had ended.
The conquering Allies banned their display in October 1945; the new Federal Republic of Germany enshrined that ban in German law in 1949.
Americans made a different choice with the symbols of the Confederacy."
Records show that an estimated 450,000 Africans were kidnapped in Africa and brought to what became the United States.

The Nazi flags were torn down while defeated German cities still burned.
It found its way into cemeteries and flag stands and even became part of some official state flags.
Deidre Berger is director of the American Jewish Committee office in Berlin.
She notes that it is difficult to compare anything to the Holocaust, the mass killing carried out by the Nazi state that took 6 million Jewish lives.
"Americans made a different choice with the symbols of the Confederacy."
Potok hailed South Carolina for recently voting to remove the Confederate flag from all official buildings.
Records show that around 450,000 Africans were kidnapped in Africa and brought to what became the United States.
By contrast, German students spend a part of each year studying the horrors of Nazi Germany.
The Nazi flags were torn down while defeated German cities still burned.
The Confederacy was formed by a group of Southern states that broke away from the United States.
The Confederate battle flag was treated very differently.
These towering peaks poured gold and silver into the cities of the valley below, but nothing in this high, rugged country comes without a price.
The regulators who allowed the companies to plug a drainage ditch and let the water accumulate inside the mountain?
Or the citizens of this town, who battled an EPA Superfund designation for more than 20 years?
With the flooding, no one can say with certainty whether one mine is connected to another and, if so, whose polluted water came out of Gold King.
"We love the place we live," he said, peppering his comments with a colorful combination of expletives delivered in a slight drawl.
But Silverton is a tourist town now.
Now, the owners of Gold King and Sunnyside are pointing fingers at each other and blaming the EPA.
"I believe Sunnyside knew it was going to happen and they stalled any action because it will cost them money to fix it," Hennis said.
Since the spill, locals have complained that the EPA ignored warnings about toxic mine water and responded to questions with vague or nonexistent answers.
These towering peaks poured gold and silver into the cities of the valley below, but nothing in this high, rugged country comes without a price.
The gold and silver mines up in the mountains enriched the cities in the valley below.
Other closed mines continue to pour 540 to 740 gallons of toxic water per minute into the Animas.
The officials who allowed the companies to plug a drainage ditch and let the water build up inside the mountain?
No one can say whether one mine is connected to another and, if so, whose polluted water came out of Gold King.
Then it dumped the toxic water into a creek.
Now, the owners of Gold King and Sunnyside are pointing fingers at each other.
"It did not cause the water buildup at Gold King," Kinross said.
They also say the EPA either did not give them clear answers to their questions or gave them no answer at all.
Angels Vet Expresscare sees about 60,000 pets annually.
But in the end, we figured we could do more for the animals by treating them rather than holding them."
About 13 years ago, Silverglat began Angels Vet Expresscare.
Now Angels Vet cares for 100,000 animals each year.
He and his wife, Lisa, moved to the area more than 30 years ago.
Silverglat decided that they needed to take action.
Angels Vet Expresscare sees about 60,000 pets each year.
It also treats another 40,000 rescue animals.
Many of the rescue animals are treated for free.
Running Angels Vet is not easy, Silverglat said.
Witnesses said the trembling and swaying of the earth went on for several minutes.
"This quake was so big, "said Prajana W. Pradham, who is helping coordinate the CARE relief agency\'s emergency response.
Nepal Republic Media, a private news service in the country, said an Indian Air Force C-130 plane carrying 40 rescue and medical personnel and 3 tons of supplies arrived in Kathmandu.
Many structures in Nepal are made of unreinforced brick or rubble and field stone, and scores of people were injured in the quake by falling bricks.
"The situation in the Everest base camp is now chaos," he told the Spanish news agency Efe.
Alex Gavan, a mountaineer, posted on Twitter that the quake triggered an avalanche from Pumori, about 5 miles west of Everest.
Rain was forecast for Sunday, which could add to the misery of those whose homes were rendered uninhabitable.
magnitude-7.8 earthquake hit Nepal on Saturday, collapsing historic buildings in the capital, Kathmandu, fracturing highways and triggering avalanches on Mount Everest.

Rain was forecast for Sunday, which could add to the misery of those whose homes were destroyed.
And every two days, she must contend with no running water at home due to austere water rationing measures imposed by the government in response to a prolonged drought.
The boxes were marked with "1465" \u2014 that is the number of families this one moving company, La Rosa del Monte, has packed for Orlando since January.
Like Puente, thousands of others are bidding farewell to their lives on the island to begin anew elsewhere in the United States.
Alejandro Garcia Padilla said that at the rate the debt situation is developing, every man, woman and child on the island would owe creditors $40,000 by 2025.
While the White House has said a federal bailout is not an option, some U.S. lawmakers have sponsored bills that could eventually allow Puerto Rico to file for bankruptcy.
Yessenia Puente is disenchanted with the Isla del Encanto.
She became a widow six years ago.
The cost of living is too high.
Yessenia Puente is disenchanted with the Isla del Encanto.
"But with everything happening now, I decided it\'s time to go.
People are going to have to rethink how to stretch their dollars."
People call Puerto Rico the Isla del Encanto, or Enchanted Island.
Several moving companies in San Juan confirmed they are extremely busy these days, packing homes for new clients heading for destinations across the United States, including Miami, Orlando, New York, Boston, Chicago and cities as far as the West Coast.
But some U.S. lawmakers have sponsored bills that could eventually allow Puerto Rico to file for bankruptcy.
People call Puerto Rico the Isla del Encanto, or Enchanted Island.
Some call Puerto Rico "the island of enchantment," but Yessenia Puente does not see it that way.
A truck showed up at her apartment near San Juan to load up her belongings.
In the meantime, Puerto Ricans have come up with various solutions of their own.
Another is to lower the amount employers must pay their workers.
The chance encounter of a Norwegian research vessel with the largest waves ever recorded amid floating packs of Arctic ice shows how such rollers could reroute shipping, damage oil platforms and threaten coastal communities with erosion.
He decided to move the Lance deeper into the pack for safety.
These waves then rapidly broke up the ice around the ship into thousands of smaller pieces.
Scientists had never imagined that Arctic waves could break up pack ice so quickly.
For the Arctic Ocean, there are stormy times ahead.
On Monday, to international fanfare, Musk unveiled the design of his Hyperloop, a $6 billion high-speed transit system powered by solar energy.
The line would travel along interstates 5 and 580 at speeds of up to 760 miles per hour and have the feel of an airliner, Musk said.
But the state is in the middle of trying to build its own bullet train, a $68 billion project that has grown in cost and fallen behind schedule.
This one operates somewhat like pneumatic delivery systems that have been used at neighborhood banks, sending packages through pressurized air tubes.
The plan, however, has been sharply disputed by outside experts who doubt that large numbers of drivers or airline passengers will be attracted to the bullet train.
But the circuitous path added to the cost and resulted in slower projected trip times.
"You get into the public arena and that is a different game."
Musk said the answer is the Hyperloop.
"Normally I would think this idea is borderline crackpot, but this guy has a track record," said Michio Kaku, a physicist who hosts television shows about futurist technologies.
By contrast, the California bullet train system envisions a much bigger annual ridership: about 20 million at minimum.
But the circuitous path added to the cost and resulted in slower projected trip times.
"Musk has been able to get away with what he has done because he does it with his own money," said Lou Thompson, a transportation expert and head of a peer review panel that oversees the bullet train project.
On Monday, to international fanfare, Musk unveiled the design of his Hyperloop, a $6 billion high-speed transit system powered by solar energy.
The line would travel along interstates 5 and 580 at speeds of up to 760 miles per hour and have the feel of an airliner, Musk said.
It would be an express trip across the 382 miles, connecting two stations.
Imagine paying $20 and sitting down inside a Space Age capsule in Los Angeles.
But the circuitous path added to the cost and resulted in slower projected trip times.
He wanted to get it into the public discussion, he said, before the state wastes more time and money on what he calls a failed system.
Then Musk started the rocket company SpaceX and co-founded electric car giant Tesla in Palo Alto.
But the circuitous path added to the cost, and resulted in slower projected trip times.
"You get into the public arena, and that is a different game."
On Monday, Aug. 12, Musk unveiled the design of his Hyperloop, a $6 billion high-speed transit system powered by solar energy.
The line would travel at speeds of up to 760 miles per hour (mph) and have the feel of an airliner, Musk said.
Solar panels on top of the tube would generate much more energy than the Hyperloop would use, he said.
They doubt that large numbers of drivers or airline passengers will be attracted to the bullet train.
Musk said the system could transport 7.4 million people a year.
But the circuitous path added to the cost, and resulted in slower projected trip times.
The capsules would shoot through the tube on a cushion of air.
But the winding path added to the cost, and resulted in slower projected trip times.
He revolutionized how people paid for things online.
And he changed spaceflight missions for NASA.
"It would be great to have an alternative to flying or driving, but obviously only if it is actually better than flying or driving," he said.
It would instead be "both one of the most expensive per mile and one of the slowest in the world."
