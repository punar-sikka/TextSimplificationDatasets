"Amtrak\'s living on a shoestring," said Steve Ditmeyer, a former associate administrator at the Federal Railroad Administration.
The dead included a U.S. naval midshipman and an employee of The Associated Press.
As seen from TV news footage and pictures posted online, pieces of the train were strewed around the track, which bends in a sharp curve in Northeast Philadelphia.
Ditmeyer said a Northeast Corridor improvement project in the late 1970s and early 1980s was supposed to straighten out curves.
Numerous curves, bridges and tunnels limit the speed of all trains on the Northeast Corridor.
Part of the train overturned, and one car was left a twisted heap of shredded metal.
"They\'re well over a hundred years old."
The system, called positive train control, is designed to prevent trains from going faster than the speed limits as they approach curves.
On Tuesday night, an Amtrak train went off the tracks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
The system of wires and steel supports that supplies electrical power to the trains dates back to the 1930s.

When Olivia Hernandez was in middle school, she became hooked on K-wave \u2014 the global phenomenon of South Korean pop music, television and culture.
She and other students are learning grammar basics and the proper way to address elders and bosses.
According to a recent national study, enrollment in Korean language courses at U.S. colleges and universities is growing faster than any other foreign language.
The number of students in Korean classes nationwide is 12,230 \u2014 well below the most studied languages, including Japanese, Chinese and Arabic.
"There\'s no doubt that Korean popular culture in film and music has captivated the minds of young people," said Rosemary Feal.
According to university officials, some of the interest in Korean is coming from the children and grandchildren of Korean immigrants.

The headline "New Planet Found" is about as exciting nowadays as "Dog Bites Man," which is to say, not very.
It is part of our own solar system \u2014 a place you would think we had explored pretty well by now.
But the evidence is strong enough that other experts are taking it seriously.
This was a case where we had our noses buried in the data, never stepping back and looking at the solar system from above."
The direction of the orbits was an even stronger hint that something was physically moving these distant objects.
When the scientists turned to the "crazy" notion of a planet, however, computer models generated just the right kind of aligned orbits.
The mood of the astronomical community is perfectly captured, Laughlin says, by something British astronomer John Herschel said in 1846.
Referring to the mystery object, Hershel said, "We see it as Columbus saw America from the shores of Spain."
In the last 20 years, astronomers have identified about 2,000 new worlds using a telescope in space.
Instead, it is part of our own solar system, a place you would think we had explored pretty well by now.

There is a special sense of magic when it comes to Disney characters at theme parks.
Donna-Lynne Dalton, a union member, said the company has now put in writing that employees are not to reveal online or in any kind of media \u2014 including social media such as Facebook, newspapers, magazines or TV \u2014 what characters they play.
Visitors entering a Disney theme park feel a special sense of magic.
Over the past few weeks, she said, workers have had to acknowledge online that they understand the rules.

Staff performers must follow rules about what to wear, how to act and how to dress.
The characters also cannot tell children at the park that they are really actors.
However, she feels the current rules take things too far.
She does not think it is reasonable to forbid employees from posting anything online about their identities at work.
Dalton said it was unclear if workers could be punished if their family members post pictures or information about the characters.
She also questioned whether Disney entertainers would get in trouble if they used the information on their resumes to get other entertaining jobs.

A coalition of Tunisian workers, business owners, rights activists and lawyers won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet "for its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy."
"It established an alternative, peaceful political process at a time when the country was on the brink of civil war," the committee said.
The young and still shaky democracy suffered two extremist attacks this year that killed 60 people and devastated its vital tourism industry.
Mohammed Fadhel Mafoudh, head of the Tunisian Order of Lawyers, called the Nobel Peace Prize a message to all parties entangled in political conflicts.
Tunisian broadcast media interrupted coverage to excitedly announce the news, and social media exploded with celebratory messages.
Tunisian protesters sparked the Arab Spring uprisings across the Arab world in 2011 that overthrew dictators and upset the status quo.
But it is the only country in the region to carefully build a democracy, involving a range of political and social forces to create a constitution, a legislature and democratic institutions.
Nobel committee chairwoman Kaci Kullmann Five said the prize was meant to encourage the Tunisian people and to show an example for other countries in the region, which did not become democracies.
"We hope we will contribute to safeguarding democracy in Tunisia and those who seek to promote peace in the Middle East and North Africa," she said.
Kullmann Five said the 8 million Swedish kronor prize, equal to $960,000, was for the quartet as a whole, not for the four individual organizations.
It was formed after the July 2013 assassination of left-wing politician Mohammed Brahmi plunged Tunisia into crisis.
A national dialogue led by the quartet helped negotiate a transition from the elected Islamist-led government to a temporary government of technocrats and organize new elections for a permanent government.
Houcine Abassi, the leader of the Tunisian General Labour Union, said he was "overwhelmed" as he found out about the award from a reporter.
French President Francois Hollande said he was "happy for all the Tunisians" and added that the prize marks the success of the former French colony to become a democracy.
"That is an encouragement to support Tunisia even more through all the hard times it faces, as we\'ve seen with terrorist acts in the last weeks and months," Hollande said.
The prize comes the day after a lawmaker and sports tycoon was shot at in the Tunisian city of Sousse, which depends heavily on tourism.

"This is a tough one \u2014 we are keenly aware that the scientific community is (split) on this issue," said Adrianna Shea, deputy chief of the California Fish and Game Commission.
This is because of laws curbing pollution, banning near-shore gill netting, protecting sharks and halting the slaughter of marine mammals they prey on.
The census was conducted from 2006 to 2008 on sharks that gather off the San Francisco coast from late July until late January.
"It\'s a lot easier counting elephants and lions," Block said, referring to animal counts in Africa.

One wonders what Mark Twain himself would make of the news: The Gold Rush-era newspaper for which he once wrote stories and witticisms on frontier life as a young journalist is once again in print after a decadeslong break.
"He\'d get a kick out of it."
Behind the current attempt is Scott Faughn, also publisher of the Missouri Times, which focuses on politics and policy.
In three years, he wrote stories about territory politicians, shoot-\'em-ups and the stock market \u2014 some of which were reprinted in his 1872 book "Roughing It."

The nutria project leader is coming back from a site in Quantico, Md., where four of his trappers are roaming the Wicomico River in boats.
It has taken longer than expected but finally, the state is almost free of the rodents.
A study in the 1990s proved that the nutria were largely responsible.
In Louisiana, the nutria population reached 20 million in 20 years, creating a problem that is now too large to get rid of.
The team is confident it can get rid of the nutria in Maryland.
They have pioneered various detection approaches that help them track, trap and kill the nutria.
During the first year of trapping on the peninsula, the team caught 5,000 nutria at the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge and in nearby private lands, Kendrot said.
Kendrot said the line of work is controversial but justified when looked at from an environmental point of view.
Led by Kendrot, the project has cleared marshes up and down the state over the last 12 years.
The wetlands in the Chesapeake region have lost more marsh than most other wetlands around the world, Kendrot said.
The nutria have set up colonies in states throughout the Southeast and Pacific Northwest.
The team caught 5,000 nutria at the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge in the first year of trapping and in nearby private lands, Kendrot said.
There are probably between 200 and 500 nutria left, Kendrot said.
But there are other places that will never recover.
"It\'s to save the marsh."
The team caught 5,000 nutria at the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge in the first year of trapping and in nearby private lands, Kendrot said.
Water can then come in and out with the tide, damaging the root mat.

On Tuesday, Mayor Eric Garcetti issued a challenge to Los Angeles residents and businesses.
The ways in which Garcetti hopes to achieve the 20 percent drop are outlined in a new city plan.
The plan calls for a gradual decrease in water use, with targets to be met by various dates.
Garcetti calls for water use to be measured on July 1, 2015, on Jan. 1, 2016 and on Jan. 1, 2017.

Her star power has stretched far beyond dance, yielding larger and larger business opportunities offstage as her importance onstage has grown.
She is senior vice president of global brand marketing for Under Armour, the Baltimore-based sportswear giant.
She has performed many starring roles recently, including the female leads in "Romeo and Juliet" and "Firebird," but at the lower rank of soloist.
The film rights for her best-selling memoir, "Life in Motion," were bought last summer.
She has more than 500,000 followers on Instagram and Twitter with pictures of her performing or relaxing in Under Armour tops and tights.
"Every time I step onto the stage, it\'s not only proving to the audience that I\'m capable, but to myself."
"But we\'ve never had a story as dynamic as Misty\'s, with that underdog mentality she has ... bucking up against all these traditional norms, showing men, women and kids that athletes come in all shapes and sizes."
She was widely expected to be among the three women selected as principals this year.
"My mother definitely instilled in me and my siblings this strength, this will, to just continue to survive and succeed."
On social media, congratulations poured in for Copeland from companies, the ballet community and fans.

Misty Copeland has become the first black ballerina to reach the highest rank of the American Ballet Theatre (ABT).
She is deeply respected and admired for her unlikely rise in an art world notorious for featuring slim white ballerinas.
She was widely expected to be among the three women selected as principals this year.
Earlier this spring, Copeland made her American debut in the lead role of Odette/Odile in "Swan Lake."
"I haven\'t come from the typical path or background of someone who would make it to this level as a ballerina," Copeland said at the time.
She also has performed in concert with the musician Prince and judged Fox television\'s "So You Think You Can Dance."
The film rights for her best-selling book, "Life in Motion," were bought last summer.
Under Armour now calls that ad campaign its most successful in history.
And yet, as Copeland told the Post, her accomplishments are still as important personally as they are publicly.
Misty Copeland has become the first black ballerina to become a principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre (ABT).
She was on the cover of Time magazine\'s "100 Most Influential People" issue.

Hong Kong pro-democracy activists occupied major streets Monday, forcing the closure of some schools, banks and other businesses.
Without a strong, close-knit group of leaders directing things, "it\'s very difficult to predict" how the situation will evolve, said Chi-Keung Choy, a professor of international politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
No one can convince them, unless the government makes big concessions," he said.
In addition, many of the youths who make up a forceful part of the demonstrators have little sense of connection to mainland China.
Hong Kong has a rich tradition of protests, but demonstrations are typically well organized and calm, with people marching along pre-planned routes with official permits.
The free-form and unpredictable nature of the last few days of protests have surprised local residents.
"It\'s shocking to see armies of police equipped with tear gas guns, rifles and batons," said Nan Hie In, who joined demonstrators Sunday night.
Even so, Ip said he would not give up because "we\'re fighting for the future of Hong Kong.
Leung had said over the weekend that local officials would soon launch a new round of talks over the 2017 election rules.

The demonstrations began in response to new rules imposed by the Chinese government at the end of the summer.
But underlying the unrest is unhappiness over a range of issues.
It has also encouraged many of them to stand with the protesters.

Pamela Battle, whose seven children range in age from 1 to 16, said she got a water filter Monday.
She went to Freeman Elementary School last Tuesday with her kids to get their blood checked for lead.
On Saturday, President Barack Obama declared an emergency in Flint and ordered the government to help.
Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said Thursday night that the city has made progress.
"That apology ain\'t going to help these kids," said Hawk, who said she doesn\'t know what dangers her children may face because of the lead.
His skin problem started with a rash on his stomach after Flint switched its water supply in April 2014.
People in Flint feel betrayed, worried, angry, sad and stressed.
"We were drinking it regularly," Battle said.

After all his calculations, he ate only two dumplings, while 52 went into a takeout box.
He has even conducted a study of how the structure of xiao long bao changes when it leaves the steamer and starts to cool, in a bid to determine the ideal window in which to devour the hot little pouches before the skin thickens too much.
Since late 2013, he has worked his way across this sprawling city of 24 million, paying surprise visits to 52 sellers of these delicacies on a quest for the ideal xiao long bao.
"They were (angry)," St. Cavish recalls, glancing through the front window to see whether the woman who had to hand-make his infuriating 54-dumpling order is behind the counter today.
"It\'s a funny experiment; I don\'t want people to take it too seriously," he says, sitting in a booth at Zun Ke Lai, his measuring equipment and three baskets of dumplings in front of him.
Yet at the same time, he says the index gives restaurant-goers \u2014 and himself \u2014 a way to think more deeply and talk more precisely about what makes a food satisfying or even delicious.
I\'m not sure if xiao long bao has benefited from this analysis, but I\'ve benefited," he said.
"As a food writer, your responsibility is to explain why you like or don\'t like something," he said.
St. Cavish says he wanted to find a new way to talk about food.
"As a food writer, your responsibility is to explain why you like or don\'t like something," he said.
In the Mandarin language, the dumplings are called as xiao long bao (pronounced SHOW-long-BAO).
When you bite into the dumpling, first you taste the hot soup.
The Welcome Revered Guests restaurant came in first place.
He worked as a cook for 10 years before coming to China.
The Shanghai Soup Dumpling Index has also made St. Cavish famous in China.
It is funny and serious at the same time.
Before coming to China, St. Cavish had never even eaten a Chinese soup dumpling.
Even today, he says they are not his favorite food.
He wanted to weigh and measure food, and figure out which food was best.
"It\'s a funny experiment; I don\'t want people to take it too seriously," he says.
Binod Tiwari leaped out of an SUV and stopped in front of a foot-wide crack in the pavement.
The best way to learn to build safer structures, Tiwari said, is to head to the disaster zones where they have failed.
"Natural disasters come without telling us," he said.
When he was a teen, his family moved to Kathmandu, the capital, where he would look through his window at the Himalayas.
It\'s "devastating," Tiwari said.
Before returning to California, Tiwari spent the last few days of his trip giving talks to engineering groups located in Nepal.
Years ago, right after graduating from a Nepali university, Tiwari built his own house.
Binod Tiwari stopped in front of a foot-wide crack in the street.
It was like "some big elephant coming to your car and shaking the car," Tiwari said.
Tiwari knew he could not leave Nepal until he had examined the buildings himself.
In April, a powerful earthquake shook Nepal.
Binod Tiwari stopped in front of a foot-wide crack in the street.
As trucks and motorcycles whizzed by, Tiwari raised his camera to take pictures.
The team wanted to find out what happened to the rock and soil during the quake.
It causes the soil to move like a liquid, tipping over buildings as if pulling the rug out from under them.
This includes what the soil is made of and the grain size, how densely packed it is, and how much water the soil holds.
Years ago, right after graduating from college, Tiwari built his own house in Nepal.
His mother still lives there, but she and terrified neighbors refused to return to their homes.
They lived together in a tent for weeks as aftershocks continued.
In April, a powerful earthquake shook Nepal.
Tiwari and his team were on the road May 12 when an aftershock hit.
"Don\'t worry, go back to your house and sleep well there," Tiwari said.
The scientists need to work fast.
Tiwari and his team were on the road May 12 when an aftershock hit.
The aftershock gave them the chance to see the damage just hours after an earthquake.
Tiwari said scientists will have to study the soil in different areas around Nepal.
"Some people don\'t like to know what their weaknesses are," said Colin Swatton, Day\'s coach and caddie.

Only a few creatures, including dragonflies, move their wings in the simple up-down motion that many people expect.
Researchers wanted to build something that can be small, simple and still remain stable in the air without too much thinking.
The design could be useful for the military, Ristroph said, though he was more excited about how everyday people can use the robot.
Theoretically, he said, mini flying jellies could be tossed into the air from a building and float around as environmental sensors and record data and adjust their position when necessary.
A team from New York University has designed a flying robot that uses four flapping wings to stay in the air.

Jellyfish, in some ways, are perfect for this task since they are very simple creatures.
Their simple bodies look like an umbrella or a bell-shaped figure with tentacles dangling down.
"It\'s an excellent example of bio-inspired engineering," said Caltech University professor John Dabiri, who is an expert on how jellyfish swim.
"I wanted to think of something very different," said Leif Ristroph, a professor at New York University.
On the other hand, the Irukandji jellyfish can be less than an inch wide.
Studying flying animals and insects is "a great place to start in terms of building a flying machine," said Ristroph.
Although they live in the ocean, jellyfish are not actually fish.
The robot has four wings that look like flower petals.
Jellyfish are not really fish.
Not real jellyfish, but robots that move like them.

For example, the number three is associated with "m." The number one is associated with "d." "So when I am given a digit such as 31, I see actor Matt Damon," Yang said.
He explained how the number 141251213 is embedded in his memory: 141 brings to mind a dart; 251 is an electrical outlet; 213 is a nutmeg.
"So I can imagine throwing a dart into an outlet and sparks shooting out around a nutmeg," Tschirhart said.

This fall, a free lunch could be coming to thousands more students around the country, thanks to a 4-year-old federal program that is finally expanding to all 50 states.
The expansion comes through the Community Eligibility Provision, passed by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010.
The federal government extended the deadline into August to give districts more time, especially after some delays in publishing the list of schools or districts eligible.
Schools where 40 percent or more of the students automatically qualify for the school lunch program are eligible to use community eligibility.
At that point, "It really becomes easier to give everyone the free meals," she said.
She said that there are some unrelated funds, like per-student aid from the state based on free-lunch enrollment levels, that are tied to paperwork.
Thousands more students around the country could be getting a free lunch in the fall.
Certain schools in three states (Illinois, Kentucky and Michigan) were able to join first, based on need and their data-sharing capabilities.
As a result, not all school districts are expected to join.
In Fort Wayne, Indiana, officials will offer the new lunch program at all elementary and middle schools starting this fall.
The district had some elementary and middle schools that already had 95 percent or more of their students covered by the free-lunch program, said Krista Stockman.
Free lunches are coming to thousands of students all around the country this fall.
There are more than 28,000 schools like this nationwide.

There is no cost to them \u2014 no forms necessary and regardless of household income.
In most states, hundreds of schools are able to join, according to a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Schools where 40 percent or more of the students automatically qualify for the school lunch program are able to use community eligibility.
Officials wanted to wait and see the effects in neighboring districts, spokeswoman Tamyra Kelly said.
Leslie Fowler runs nutrition support services for Chicago schools.
She said that to make the new program work, they had to be sure enough students would be able to join under existing rules.
They reached their set level under older free lunch rules, 62.5 percent of all students in the district.
The money could be more difficult to collect if no paperwork is necessary for the free lunch program.
Free lunches are coming to thousands of students all around the country this fall.
Originally, districts had until the end of June to decide to join.
She said they had to be sure enough students would be able to join under existing rules.
People say it is a help to the low-income school lunch program.
In Fort Wayne, Indiana, all elementary and middle schools will get free lunches starting this fall.
She said they had to be sure enough students would be able to join under existing rules.
"It doesn\'t make sense to do district-wide if you don\'t get to that threshold.
Then the government moved the deadline into August.
It wanted to give districts more time to decide.
Nobody knows for sure how many new school districts will sign up this year.
"Everyone\'s got a great meal that they can get at no charge," said Madeleine Levin.
Under the new program, the government pays for only a part of the new schools that are joining.
Some schools have 4 out of 10 students who can get a free lunch.
We\'ll continue to raise generation after generation of students who do not understand what it means to be an American, who equate freedom of speech with "selfies," who believe freedom of religion requires purging religion from the public square, who think our Founding Fathers \u2014 belittled in popular culture as dead old white men \u2014 are irrelevant.
To successfully teach U.S. history and government, so students understand and appreciate the principles that define our American character, teachers need to rely less on textbooks.
Tribune did not subsidize the writing of this column; the opinions are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of Tribune or Newsela.
The result is that our country has continued \u2014 although often after the fact \u2014 to correct past mistakes in its 239-year quest to create a more perfect union.
As Peter Levine of Boston\'s Tufts University recently pointed out: "Requiring students to pass a citizenship exam will reduce both the amount and quality of civic education in our schools."
In the Baltimore area, where I live, the highlights of local history become even more fascinating when linked to those of the nation.

Teachers spend too much time learning how to teach, and not enough time learning what to teach.
Teaching government and history involves more than just significant dates and events and connecting them with names.
It involves more than a basic familiarity with a handful of historically significant documents, such as the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights and Emancipation Proclamation.
By all means we should recognize our flaws at home and mistakes abroad.

It involves more than a basic familiarity with a handful of historically significant documents, such as the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights and Emancipation Proclamation.
Instead, they should rely more on the writings and thinking of those who shaped our country.
Stuffing in more American history and civics classes is exactly the wrong way to accomplish that mission.
Typically classes teach about the U.S. crimes against Native Americans, Mexicans, African-Americans, Irish and Italian immigrants, and women.
As Peter Levine of Boston\'s Tufts University points out: "Requiring students to pass a citizenship exam will reduce both the amount and quality of civic education in our schools."
Instead, history and government courses are too often taught in public schools as a series of crimes by the U.S.

Uriana had helped arrange the marriage as part of his role as palabrero, a title that literally means "the word."
When it comes to marriage, Uriana said that freedom of choice is not an option for the Wayuu: "All our marriages are arranged by the families and the couple has to live by that."
His other tasks include resolving land disputes, monitoring debt payments and dividing lumber and other shared goods.
School director Nelson Iguaran says these bilingual schools are essential to preserving the Wayuu way of life.
Not long ago, most Colombians looked down on palabreros and other Wayuu customs.
Colombians are gaining a new respect for the Wayuu and other native groups.
Part of the reason for this change is a new law that was passed in 2010.
The ministry also included the languages used by Afro-Colombians and criollos (people with Spanish ancestors).
This time, the ministry used the information to make a new computer program.
At one of these schools, first- through eighth-graders from the Wayuu community have teachers who speak both languages.

"It reduces the forces that are keeping the fault clamped together \u2014 leading to more small earthquakes during dry periods of time," said Colin B. Amos, the study\'s lead author.
Other scientists studying a seismically active area of southern Monterey County observed that there are often more earthquakes during dry months than during wet months.
The groundwater theory introduced by Amos and his coworkers gives one possible answer.
He called the suggestion that groundwater depletion could lead to more earthquakes "somewhat controversial."
Groundwater has been slowly drained in the Central Valley to quench the thirst of farms and cities since the mid-1800s.
The study does not suggest the next Big One to hit Los Angeles or San Francisco will be caused by human activity, Amos said.
He called the suggestion that less groundwater could lead to more earthquakes "somewhat controversial."

The study does not suggest the next Big One to hit Los Angeles or San Francisco will be caused by humans, said Colin B. Amos.
The sections of the San Andreas fault closer to San Francisco and Los Angeles are much stronger and more locked.
The number doubled between 1984 and 2005.
Parkfield was the starting point of a big earthquake that hit the San Andreas fault in 1857.
"It won\'t necessarily happen that way" again in our lifetime, said Hough.
The San Andreas fault is a famous source of earthquakes.
U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Susan Hough said the idea that less groundwater can trigger earthquakes is very possible.
He called the suggestion that less groundwater could lead to more earthquakes "somewhat controversial."
Other scientists studying an area of southern Monterey County noticed that there are often more earthquakes during dry months than during wet months.
It was 60 miles wide from end to end.
Hough said further study was needed to figure out whether less groundwater in other areas could lead to earthquakes elsewhere.
Other scientists studying an area of southern Monterey County found that there were more earthquakes during dry months.
Tulare Lake was once the largest body of fresh water west of the Mississippi River.
Groundwater has been slowly drained in the Central Valley to get water to thirsty farms and cities since the mid-1800s.
The study does not suggest the next Big One to hit Los Angeles or San Francisco will be caused by humans, said Colin B. Amos.
That fault was so big that shaking lasted from 1 to 3 minutes.
That means not much change in pressure is needed to cause earthquakes.
The shaking lasted from 1 to 3 minutes.
That means humans may be causing the gradual increase in the number of earthquakes, the study found.

"I was already frustrated at how addicted to texting my daughter was," said the San Clemente, Calif., father of four, who at the time had just learned a grim fact: More than 7,000 Americans had died from texting and driving during the previous year.
The organization plans to gather several thousand signatures from drivers who pledge to avoid texting in vehicles for the next 12 months.
NASCAR drivers Kyle Busch and Joey Logano already have signed their names to the side of the yellow Text Kills bus that has been crisscrossing the U.S. since 2010.

She has a movie project in the works, but the defeat was a sobering reminder of what generated such fame and where her focus should be.
"Everything we worked on ended up being used," Holm (10-0) said after the fight, which drew a crowd of 56,214 people.
In 2011, after getting knocked out by boxer Anne Sophie Mathis, she devised a plan and won a rematch.
White first leaned toward making Miesha Tate the No.
The stunning event came after Rousey, who is from Los Angeles, California, acted out of character by confronting Holm at the weigh-in a day earlier.
Rousey, age 28, is six years younger than Holm, but she appeared very tired by the end of the first round.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140227_FOODLABELS.jpg" />WASHINGTON \u2014 On Thursday the Obama administration proposed the first major revamp of nutrition labels in more than 20 years.
The changes are aimed, in part, at addressing serious public health issues.
The FDA should also display the amount of sugar as a percentage of recommended daily value, argued Michael F. Jacobson, the founder of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
It suggests women should take in no more than 25 grams per day and men no more than 35 grams per day.
To ensure compliance, companies would have to keep records of added sugar for FDA inspection.
The FDA proposal would also change serving sizes to reflect the most recent information on consumer habits.
With the update, the serving sizes set in 1994 would increase for some products, such as ice cream.
This would provide a breakdown by both serving size and container size.
Administration officials said the new labels could bring between $20 billion and $30 billion in savings.
On Thursday the government proposed a change to the way food is labeled.
On the proposed new labels the calorie count would appear in larger, bold typeface.
However, people often drink soda in 12-ounce cans or even larger bottles.
The proposed rule would require the serving size to be at least 12 ounces.
"The half-cup of ice cream" or "2-ounce muffins and bagels," haven\'t been seen in Americans eating habits for years, he said.
This would provide a breakdown of calories and sugar by both serving size and container size.
Officials said widespread obesity was one of the primary reasons for the update.
But, they said, they believe the labels could help curb it.
On Thursday the government announced changes to the way food is labeled.

ATTLE - Suicide hangs over Indian Country.
The Spokane-based program has helped 65 tribes across the country combat suicide for the past five years.
"The car accident, the gun death, the overdose, there are a lot of suicides that are not reported as such," said Victoria Wagner, the head of the Youth Suicide Prevention Program.
As in Washington state, the suicide rate among native youth nationally is 2-1/2 times that of any other youth population.
Patricia Whitefoot, director of Indian Education for the Toppenish School District, said suicide prevention is a top priority identified by parents of her students.
Native students took a wellness walk last Friday to emphasize the positive role that culture can play in this, she said.
The Colville, Spokane and Yakama tribes are using prevention grants and training through the Native Aspirations Program.
"The car accident, the gun death, the overdose, there are a lot of suicides that are not reported as such," said Victoria Wagner.

This is so easy," says Meek, a kindergartner at Marshall Elementary in Marysville, north of Seattle.
Chicago says computer science will eventually become a high school requirement.
"In the 21st century, computer science is just as foundational as biology, chemistry," said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org.
"We\'re not talking about turning everybody into a computer programmer or computer scientist," Kafai said.
Jim Taylor, author of "Raising Generation Tech," says there\'s no evidence at this point that coding or computational learning works, or is even needed.
"Technology is the solution du jour for all our education problems," Taylor said.
"Just as important is the fact that computing is everywhere in our lives," she said.
Among other efforts, the National Science Foundation wants to have 10,000 well-trained computer science teachers in thousands of high schools.
"It\'s access that we didn\'t previously have," and ensures the kids will be as well prepared as their peers are for the digital future, she said.
Using Code.org lessons, teacher Sheena York asks a class of fifth-graders to identify the pattern in the computer puzzle and solve it using the fewest steps.

Researchers have done thousands of studies on gaming since the 1980s, often with clearly negative results.
Some associated video games with an increased risk of epileptic seizures, while others warned that gaming could cause dangerously elevated heart rates.
One recent project actually concluded that some children who play violent games are less likely than others to be bullies.
"Games can be this really important tool for teaching people what the right decisions might be," he said.
"Maybe one way to do that is showing what the consequences of wrong decisions would be."
She found that those who play video games for an average of three to six hours a day were healthier than those who played less.
That theory made sense to Dan Wojtowicz, 18, a student at Andrew High School in Tinley Park, Illinois.
The most intriguing studies might be coming from neuroscientists, who are learning how gaming affects the brain.
Now that he is 21, he spends up to four hours a day battling enemies in "Dota 2."
One project actually concluded that some children who play violent games are less likely to be bullies.
Yet professor Chennan Liu found that those who play video games for three to six hours a day were healthier than those who played less.
"When I go on long gaming streaks, many times I don\'t feel the need to eat as much," he said.
His attention and focus have also improved, he said, as has his self-awareness.
"What I\'ve found is I generally try to resolve things peacefully."
He grew up mesmerized by games from "Pokemon" to "Call of Duty," and dodged the limits his parents put on his gaming by playing his Game Boy after bedtime.
Yet he was an honor student at Downers Grove North High School outside of Chicago, and today he is studying at the University of Chicago.
This did not come in spite of gaming, but because of it, Rivera said.
"Without a doubt they have benefited me," he said.
A new wave of research has found surprising advantages in an activity that many call a waste of time, if not an outright menace.
She is a neuroscientist who researches video games at the University of Rochester in New York.
With a new generation of scientists more familiar with technology, different results often appear in studies, said Christopher Ferguson, a professor at Stetson University in Florida.

In January, French-born Islamic extremists shocked the country with three days of terror attacks.
Valls called a special government meeting to tackle this divide in society.
Twenty people, including the three gunmen, were killed in the attacks on a kosher market and the paper Charlie Hebdo.
Many in the suburbs of Paris said they understood why some children did not observe the moment of silence, even though they were against the terror attacks.
"People were killed in the housing projects by police, and there was no minute of silence for them, said Aly Sacko, a 28-year-old in Clichy-sous-Bois.
Soaring unemployment, a high crime rate and not enough public transportation fed a deep sense of inequality.
France assumes that all colors, races and creeds will blend into a single people.
When he was president, Nicolas Sarkozy made fixing the suburbs an important concern.
It included $728 million to create new trains, more "second-chance schools" for dropouts, and advice for youths wanting to start a company or get on a job track.
For example, take the housing project that was home to Amedy Coulibaly, one of the Paris gunmen.
It remains a different world from the government palaces of the capital, just a few miles away.
Gunmen belonging to a terror group shocked France with three days of  attacks in January.
Concern about schools grew after some children refused to observe a minute of silence for victims of the attacks.
Protests first broke out in 1990.

The Obama administration has stopped short of saying openly that North Korea was involved in the attack.
Republican Senator John McCain, who called Sony\'s decision to cancel the movie\'s release "profoundly troubling," has long demanded the United States step up cyber operations.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that responses under consideration are ones "that we wouldn\'t want to telegraph in advance."
North Korea is "really working on their cyber capability; it gives a poorer nation international reach," said retired Brigadier General Michael McDaniel, a former Pentagon official.
In June, North Korea called the plot of "The Interview" an "act of war."
Still, it praised the hacking as a "righteous deed of supporters and sympathizers."
He said that responses under consideration are ones "that we wouldn\'t want to telegraph in advance."
President Barack Obama acknowledged that the attack against Sony shows the United States has more work to do to strengthen its online security.

They demanded that the movie studio cancel the release of its film "The Interview."
Experts now say the cyber attack seems likely to have been led by North Korea.
The sanctions were imposed to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.
In response to the threat against movie theaters, Sony canceled the release of "The Interview."
He said that responses under consideration are ones "that we wouldn\'t want to telegraph in advance."
So far, administration officials have given somewhat different accounts about the degree of its involvement.
One senior administration official, speaking anonymously, said U.S. intelligence agencies have linked North Korea to the attack.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has not confirmed that the North Korean government was behind the hacking operation.
Last year, South Korea concluded the North was behind a hack of banks and news organizations critical of North Korea.
He said the FBI should know more about the cyber attack in coming days, and that the U.S. will work hard to prevent further attacks.
His advice for Americans, the president said, "would be that people go to the movies."
Right now their choices seem limited.
They make it difficult for North Korea to buy from and sell to other countries, and for North Koreans to travel.
In part this is because it is unwilling to say what proof it does have.
Still, it praised the hacking as a noble act carried out by "supporters and sympathizers."
Such computer attackers are known as hackers.
The movie was already attracting attention before the cyber attack.
North Korea is a very poor country.
However, experts believe the country does have a small group of top hackers working for it.
It shows that the United States must do more to keep its computers safe.

In a country that once thought breeding mini-cows was a good idea, Cubans have become masters of improvisations and inventions.
Cubans have been "resolviendo" \u2014 loosely translated as "making do" \u2014 since shortages of all types began hitting the island in the early 1960s.
"The revolution injected Cubans with inventiveness to survive the shortages created by the Americans," Oroza said.
With gasoline becoming scarce and expensive, some Cubans worked out ways of converting their car and truck motors to natural gas.
Other inventions were simply ingenious.
Oroza recalled that in the early years of the Castro revolution, there was even a group designed to promote the improvisations and inventions.
A year later, they published a second book with the ideas for gadgets, work-arounds and herbal medicines that had been sent in by readers.

"When a lot of cameras are going to be pointed on the city, they want to have an image of the city that does not include poverty," said Jennifer Friedenbach.
He said the committee is donating $13 million of the $50 million raised to San Francisco area charities that are mainly aimed at alleviating poverty.
"The tremendous safety enhancements that have been made over the past 30 years were put into play in this tragic event," said Larry Rooney, executive vice president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations, a pilots trade association.
"It was a tragic loss of life, but nowhere near what you would have anticipated."
The Boeing 777 that crashed July 6 has a record as one of the safest planes in the sky, said Kevin Hiatt, president and chief executive officer of the Flight Safety Foundation.
He now operates AirSafe.com which is a Web site that provides information for travelers on safety and security.
The airplane that struck the seawall at San Francisco International Airport, breaking off its tail, had its maiden flight on Feb 5, 2006.
Firefighters entering the aircraft found the seats toward the front of the aircraft "almost pristine, like you could fluff the pillows and almost go out," National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said.
"But if you can slow that down to a point where you can get the aircraft evacuated, it makes all the difference in the world."
The crash landing of Asiana Flight 214 has given the safety improvements of the past 30 years the chance to prove how much they matter.
"Accidents are very rare, and this one will be closely looked at," said Todd Curtis.

Firefighters entering the aircraft found the seats toward the front of the aircraft in almost perfect shape, "like you could fluff the pillows and almost go out," National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said.
FAA rules say passengers should be able to leave the aircraft in 90 seconds, even if some exits are blocked.
Also, materials inside the passenger area are designed not to crack and create sharp surfaces.
"The crews are better trained than they were," said Rooney, who has flown for 30 years.

Acquaintances advised the professor to keep a low profile, stay away from his university in East Jerusalem and consider taking a vacation abroad, he recalled.
"It is a history ignored, mentioned as part of a plot to establish a Jewish state in Palestine."
Dajani has publicly supported Holocaust education among Palestinians and has devoted part of his own classes to the subject.
The trip to Auschwitz was arranged as part of a reconciliation research project sponsored by Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany.
The schedule included a trip to Krakow, where participants learned about Jewish life before the Holocaust and visited former Jewish neighborhoods and synagogues.
"I visited the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem three years ago, but here it was different," said Salim Sweidan, who went on the trip.
Nasser al-Qadi, who is getting a master\'s degree in American studies at Al Quds, said he joined the trip because it was "our humanitarian duty, regardless of our rift with the Israeli side."
He added, "We went there for education, and we believe that there are no restrictions over education."
Abdullah Dweikat, a columnist, wrote on the Palestinian news website Watan: "We reject the extermination of any human being because of his religion, nationality or political views, but our humanity also rejects disregarding the wounds and pain of our people, who are being slaughtered every day at the hands of the occupiers."
Last month, Professor Mohammed Dajani took 30 Palestinian students to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp.
"In my community you see a lot of ignorance of the Holocaust," Dajani said.

The water is extracted and the material is dried, then processed into animal feed, fertilizer or a medicinal supplement known as hutai sugar, which is said to help lower blood sugar, according to a report in the Qingdao News.
In the other direction, a backhoe scooped big piles of it into dump trucks.
On Saturday, Lejun and his 69-year-old grandpa had helped gather globs of it from the sea.
One user of the microblog Weibo shared a recipe for a hutai dish that looked like guacamole.

With movie-star looks, a supermodel wife and four Super Bowl championship rings, quarterback Tom Brady has been an NFL golden boy, But even a golden boy has to play by the rules.
The punishment comes days after the league announced the results of an investigation that found Brady was "likely generally aware" that equipment assistants had conspired to deflate the Patriots\' footballs for last season\'s American Football Conference (AFC) championship game.
Brady\'s agent, Don Yee, called the Wells report "an incredibly frail exercise in fact-finding and logic" and said Brady would appeal.
Kraft called the investigation "one-sided" and complained that scientific evidence showing that cold weather caused the deflation had been dismissed.
"It\'s a good thing the @nfl suspended Tom Brady now everyone knows that NOBODY is above the system," former NFL linebacker Shawne Merriman wrote on Twitter.
In 2007, they were caught breaking league rules by videotaping the sideline hand signals of New York Jets coaches.

A jury convicted 11 former Atlanta teachers and administrators on trial in the largest test-cheating scandal in the nation.
On Wednesday afternoon, 10 former teachers and school administrators were handcuffed and taken to jail, where they will await sentencing and possibly decades in prison.
Two others, including former school Superintendent Beverly Hall, died of cancer before they could be put on trial.
The case began in 2008, when the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper broke the first story highlighting suspect test scores in Atlanta Public Schools and other Georgia districts.
Special investigators aided by scores of Georgia Bureau of Investigation agents interviewed hundreds of Atlanta Public Schools employees, some of whom confessed to cheating.
The investigative report released in July 2011 concluded that cheating was widespread and that thousands of schoolchildren were deprived of the education they deserved.
The report said the system was ready for cheating because of the severe consequences for failure, including firings, demotions and public humiliation.
"I think every teacher understands now the downsides of bad integrity," Davis said.
But Richard Quartarone, a father of two children in an Atlanta school, said the verdict brings his city no closer to healing.
Prosecutors said cheating had gone on for years, denying thousands of an education.
Angela Williamson, a former teacher at Dobbs Elementary School in southeast Atlanta who was convicted of telling kids the correct test answers, could spend the most time in prison.
She was also convicted on four other counts, more than any of her co-defendants, with the other charges carrying prison sentences of five years or more.
Twenty-one others pleaded guilty, and many of them testified at trial.
Eleven former Atlanta teachers and administrators were found guilty of cheating and might have to go to prison for decades.
Students in a fourth-grade class at Dobbs Elementary School had a 1 in 288 septillion chance of doing as well as they seemed to do.
"I have always felt the whole thing was tragic," said Erroll Davis, who replaced Hall as superintendent.
He said she whispered to him that she could not believe she had been convicted on all five charges against her.
It said that the new superintendent and the school board are working together to change the school system.

And, Loveless continues, media reports about increasingly overburdened children are real but not the norm.
Some schools have policies by which kindergarten homework is limited to 10 to 15 minutes a night, growing to 40 to 60 minutes in grade 5.

In the 2012 college freshmen survey, students were asked how much time they spent per week on various activities in their last year of high school.
In that year 49.5 percent of college freshmen said they spent six or more hours a week studying and doing homework in their last year of high school.
"The bottom line: regardless of how the question is posed, NAEP data do not support the view that the homework burden is growing, nor do they support the belief that the proportion of students with a lot of homework has increased in recent years," Loveless\'s report stated.
Nearly two-thirds said they had spent six or more hours a week socializing with friends.
Amma Ababio, of Highland Park, is an 11th-grader at Pittsburgh Allderdice High School.

It also trailed exercise or sports, and working for pay.
Back in 1986, the fraction of students who spent at least six hours a week on schoolwork was larger: one-half said they had.
It was almost the same in 2012 as it was in 1984.
"The bottom line," Loveless says, is this: The "homework burden" does not seem to be growing.
He figures he spends "maybe an hour on homework tops."

And with each double-winning horse that falls short at Belmont Park, the racing community is left to wonder whether the three-race sweep will ever be achieved again.
Trainer Art Sherman said that with all the attention he was getting, he felt like singer Willie Nelson.
Other trainers with dreams of the Triple Crown likely have felt the same.
But Steven Brandt of Maryland, who owns Preakness entrant Kid Cruz, said horses have changed since Affirmed pulled off the feat.
Coburn lamented that trend after the Preakness, saying "there are trainers out there that train horses just to upset the apple cart."
"I honestly believe that if the Triple Crown is not won this year by California Chrome, I will never see it in my entire lifetime," said Steve Coburn.
"I know, right now, we\'re running on a high, but I think when we get to Belmont, this horse is going to run big."
Other trainers with Triple Crown dreams likely have felt the same.
Several Derby horses skip the Preakness and instead wait for the Belmont to give them a better chance.

To win the Triple Crown, a horse must win three races \u2014 the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes.
He said "there are trainers out there that train horses just to upset the apple cart."
Still, the storylines that develop during Triple Crown season attract casual race fans such as Glenn Moyer.
Since then, 12 horses have completed the Derby-Preakness double without adding the third jewel.

A verdict in the city of Jacksonville is again raising the issue of self-defense and race in Florida.
Following an argument over loud music coming from the car that Davis was in, Dunn said he shot at the car with his 9 mm handgun.
"Although I don\'t think the evidence supports this, it is possible that the jury felt that Dunn was proper to stand his ground as to Davis, but his shooting of the others in the car was excessive," said Kenneth Nunn.
Nunn and other experts said Sunday that it\'s possible the jury was confused regarding first-degree murder and the idea that it must be "premeditated."
But the Florida Supreme Court could reduce the total sentence to 20 years if it decides that separate sentences should not come from one criminal episode, said Weinstein.
Michael Dunn, a white 47-year-old software developer, could face 60 years in prison following his conviction Saturday on several counts of attempted murder for shooting into a carful of teenagers.
But in each case, jurors were told by the judges that they should vote not guilty if they found the defendant had no duty to retreat and had the right to "stand his ground."
People are talking about self-defense and race in Florida again.
Dunn said he felt his life was in danger when he fired the shots.
Zimmerman told police he shot Martin only after the African-American teenager  attacked him.

"I basically told him to stay strong," the lawyer, Cory Strolla said Saturday night, "and we\'re still going to fight."
People are talking about self-defense and race in Florida again.
"It is possible that the jury felt that Dunn was proper to stand his ground as to Davis, but his shooting of the others in the car was excessive," said Kenneth Nunn.
He said he thought he saw a shotgun in the car.
The shooting came after a fight over loud music coming from the car that Davis was in.
Dunn could agree to a sentence of less than 60 years and to not appeal.
It could decide that separate sentences should not come from one criminal event.
Dunn could agree to a sentence of less than 60 years.
He was found guilty Saturday on several counts of attempted murder for shooting into a car full of teenagers.
Nunn said he did not think the evidence backed up that thinking.
Zimmerman told police he shot Martin only after the African-American teenager attacked him.
Dunn could agree to a sentence of less than 60 years.
That could let the Davis family move on.
The Dominican Republic sends more more players to the major leagues than any other nation besides the United States.
Paulino passed girls selling popcorn out of a plastic garbage tub and a woman selling soda from a shoebox.
The sport gives many people hope.
Now, he is the general manager of a Dominican team.
There\'s a lot of programs and tryouts and there\'s a lot of teams competing to sign the best players."
On a recent afternoon in the Dominican Republic, thousands of people came to watch a baseball game.
Others sat on top of the dugouts to watch.
Just before the game started, Richard Paulino walked into the stadium.
The latest cover of the French satirical paper Charlie Hebdo shows a weeping Muslim Prophet Muhammad holding a sign that says, "Je suis Charlie" \u2014 "I am Charlie."
He noted that 3 million copies will be published in multiple languages in contrast to the usual run of 60,000 copies per week.
He said he chose to put Muhammad on the cover because "he is a character that got our offices burned, and a character who at first got us treated as the great white knights of the freedom of the press because the offices had burned down.
The latest cover of the French satirical paper Charlie Hebdo shows the Muslim Prophet Muhammad.
"This Muhammad is so much nicer than the ones the terrorists" describe, Biard said, holding the cover aloft.
It was one of the few light moments at the emotional meeting, during which Luzier repeatedly choked up or rubbed tears from his eyes.
"We trust people\'s intelligence, their sense of humor," he said.
"People who committed this attack are just people who lack humor."

Kennewick man is the name scientists gave to an ancient skeleton found in Washington state in 1996.
The discovery was reported in the journal Nature.
In 2004, after nearly 10 years in court, the tribes lost the case.
They compared his DNA with DNA of people from Asia and the Americas.
Kennewick Man "shares by far the most with other Native Americans," he said.
In 1996 the bones of an ancient man were found in Washington state.
In 1996 the bones of an ancient man were found in Washington state.
They said DNA shows that he is related to the Native Americans living today.
A law was passed in 1990 that said Native American remains on U.S. lands must be returned to their tribes.
Morten Rasmussen is a scientist at the Stanford School of Medicine.
They also looked at DNA from the Colville tribe.
Rasmussen said the results of the tests were clear.
team of astronomers peering deep into the heavens has discovered the earliest, most distant galaxy yet.
Astronomers can usually figure out which one it is by measuring how much that distant starlight gets stretched, or "redshifted."
To narrow in, they used the MOSFIRE infrared spectrograph at the Keck I telescope in Hawaii to search for a fingerprint of hydrogen in the starlight known as the Lyman-alpha line.
Early galaxies \u2014 such as EGS-zs8-1 \u2014 are "probably the source of ultraviolet radiation that ionized the whole universe," Illingworth said.
"Big Hero 6" has been a big hit for Walt Disney Animation Studios, winning an Oscar and taking in more than $500 million at the box office.
It simulates the physics of light, which can make animated films more lifelike or give them an otherworldly look.
Pixar, which is owned by the same company as Disney Animation, has long been a trailblazer, producing the first feature-length computer-animated film, 1995\'s "Toy Story."
The city, a mash-up of San Francisco and Tokyo, is situated on a shimmering bay and is filled with towering skyscrapers and pulsing neon lights.
The software is now being used by Disney Animation for its upcoming movie "Zootopia," which will be released in March 2016.
It also was used for "Frozen Fever", a short film that features the characters of "Frozen" and "Feast," the Oscar-nominated short that premiered alongside "Big Hero 6."

Emergency-response robots are a great idea, but they have many problems in the real world.
Nowhere was this more painfully obvious than in Japan four years ago, after a small squadron of robots was sent to assist workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.
The robots spent a good deal of time on the sidelines, leaving humans to do the most hazardous work.
The world will see just how far robots have advanced in the years since, when the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hosts the final round of a robotics competition next month.
Some 25 international teams will compete June 5-6 to win cash prizes totaling $3.5 million.
The course is designed to look like a disaster area that is too dangerous for humans to enter.
When robots arrived in Fukushima in March 2011, they found the facility contaminated by radiation and filled with tons of damaging seawater.
The radiation shielding they added to protect the robots, in combination with other factors, created disruptions in communication that left the machines operating without instruction for periods of time.
"The robots that you\'re going to see at the challenge are very far from" ones that could be sent into a situation such as earthquake-stricken Nepal, Pratt said.
The development of fully mobile, multitasking machines that can serve as fully functioning responders will take many years.

Nowhere was this more painfully obvious than in Japan four years ago, after a small team of robots was sent to help workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.
It is aimed at building robots that can step \u2014 or roll \u2014 in when disasters strike.
As an added challenge, DARPA will make sure robots and their operators have a difficult time communicating with each other.
When robots arrived in Fukushima in March 2011, they found the plant contaminated with radiation and filled with tons of damaging seawater.
A previous DARPA competition required robots to press an emergency shutoff switch, get up from a reclined position and travel 10 meters (about 33 feet) without falling.
The competition will feature similar \u2014 but not the same \u2014 challenges.
"We know that we have to develop technology to help us to address these kinds of disasters."

Still, he said, "it\'s a little unsettling to know that in five minutes I might have to grab that playbook and call the governor."
Buildings, bridges and roads are in ruins.
Survivors stand on rooftops, cling to floating debris or are trapped inside wrecked buildings.
"That playbook is never more than 100 feet from where I am," said Andrew Phelps, head of the Oregon Office of Emergency Management.
Emergency hospitals would be set up because those on the coast probably would be too damaged to use.

Then the Alaska nursing home cooked musk ox meatloaf for its elderly Inupiat residents and their visiting family members.
"It opens doors for our tribes and their citizens to continue having access to traditional foods," said Leslie Wheelock, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s office of tribal relations.
The Birds Springs chapter of the Navajo Nation in Arizona is developing a 20-bed nursing home it hopes to open next year.
Boosting the new endeavor in Kotzebue, however, is a new plant down the road that is processing and storing the meat of animals donated by local hunters.
It costs up to $100 to purchase a 40-pound case of ground beef, plus 78 cents a pound to fly it from Anchorage.
However, subsistence meals tend to be gobbled up, according to Cyrus Harris, whose job with Maniilaq includes hunting for the needs of elders.
Many vacationers will walk over runaway vines, wait in long lines at park entrances and miss out on campfire talks.
Many had to cut staff and shorten hours during the recession.
The smaller workforce will result in less frequent mowing, sand-covered bike paths, messier restrooms and fewer guides.
California was able to keep open all of its 280 state beaches, reserves and parks, thanks in part to more than $3 million raised by private donor groups.
A new entrance fee \u2014 $10 per day and $30 for an annual pass\u2014has generated only about half of the money that was expected.
We\'re going to do less with less," park spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge said.
National parks in 2011 brought $13 billion in visitor spending to their nearby communities, a study found.
Local businesses from the towns of Jackson and Cody, Wyoming, came to the rescue when Yellowstone National Park officials announced they would wait an extra two weeks to open two snowy park entrances.
The towns figured the two-week closure could cost them as much as $4 million in lost hotel, restaurant and other revenue.
Yosemite National Park is absorbing much of its $1.8 million budget cut by leaving about 20 management jobs unfilled, said park spokesman Scott Gediman.
To deal with a $359,000 cut, the Gulf Islands National Seashore in Florida and Mississippi will shut three visitor centers a few days each week and close some restrooms.
Most trash cans are history, replaced by a take-out-your-own-garbage policy.
Because of a $700,000 cut, Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming has canceled Junior Ranger programs and reduced campfire programs and guided walks.
Waits could be longer for medical response and backcountry searches, said spokeswoman Jackie Skaggs.
State parks attract more than 741 million visitors a year.
At Grand Canyon National Park, for example, the visitor center will open an hour later and close an hour earlier.
National parks in 2011 brought $13 billion in visitor spending to their nearby communities, a study  found.
Businesses raised $175,000 for snowplowing to open the roads on time.
Other national parks around the country also have had to make budget-related changes: At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, a $1.2 million cut means that six buildings will be closed.
The Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky has absorbed a $324,000 cut by leaving four jobs unfilled.
Long response times for any electric problem deep in the cave means that tours to the deepest sections will be canceled.
Waits could be longer for medical help and rescue searches, said spokeswoman Jackie Skaggs.
"We\'ve already started hearing from the people who go there, people who have their beloved secret places," she said.
In states that are still struggling, those cuts have not been undone.
In a normal summer, the Park Service hires an extra 10,000 people to handle the larger crowds.
But this year, it will cut that number by 1,000.
It also cut 5 percent from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which helps states pay for their state parks.
Some 401 national parks, monuments, battlefields, historic sites, seashores and other national sites could all be affected.

In Easton, Maryland, an untold story of free African-Americans is being dug right out of the ground.
Former slaves founded such settlements, where they enjoyed early emancipation and the chance to own property and trade freely.
Other artifacts include bits of a blue glass pitcher from the 1800s and a 1-cent coin featuring Lady Liberty, dated 1794.
These activities were far more likely to have been carried out by free blacks who lived on the land than by the property owner.
Priscilla Morris has family roots in Easton that date back to the 1600s, and she is a regular visitor to the site.
"Nobody ever told us there was this extraordinary, large, free community," she said.

This census recorded some 410 free African-Americans living on The Hill.
He showed off part of an olive-green glass bottle, decorated with cluster of grapes, that he said was probably used to hold wine.
Since the dig began, more than 500 people have visited the site.
But others have just wandered in after seeing "public archaeology excavation" signs posted around the block.
Priscilla Morris has family roots in Easton that date back to the 1600s.
She said she finds the dig "thrilling" because no one quite knows how people lived at The Hill two hundred years ago.

Rust and decay destroy a lot of history, but Massachusetts officials can thank the elements for helping uncover the past.
It was cemented into the cornerstone, which officials recently decided to remove while trying to prevent water from seeping into the aging statehouse.
A reporter on the scene said Thursday that several dimes from 1854 fell out of the cornerstone as workers dug their way inside.
Less than half a mile away stands the Old State House, built in 1713 and the oldest surviving public building in Boston.
A time capsule was found there three months ago.
They were torn down and destroyed in a fire, said Heather Leet, director of development at the Bostonian Society, which was founded to restore the Old State House.
But the harsh harbor winds whipping down State Street forced officials to replace the replacements in 1901, with unicorn and a lion statues made of copper, Leet said.
Those statues had to be restored after decades of damage from those same New England winds, Leet said.
The Bostonian Society took suggestions from the city and beyond, then created a new Boston-oriented time capsule for 2014.
Massachusetts officials can thank a water leak for uncovering a more than 200-year-old time capsule.
An engraved silver plate, newspapers, cards and the title page of the Massachusetts Colony Records also may be inside.
A reporter on Thursday reported that several dimes from 1854 fell out of the cornerstone as workers dug their way inside.

My parents never took interest in my schooling," Robinson said.
"She wanted to believe what she said more than anybody, but lacked a lot of the confidence in following what she knew what she wanted to do."
Even though she grew up with both her parents in the Central District of Seattle, hers was hardly an ideal childhood.
"If they are not attending school or their grades are low, or if they don\'t have enough credits, if they are not connected to their communities or schools, the dropout rate goes through the roof," Schloss said.
"Honestly, as a kid it shouldn\'t have been, but my main focus was like, wanting them to do what they had to do so I could go back home with them," she said.
"She really was able to start to see how some of those classes she didn\'t like, like math and science, were necessary for her to get what she wanted.
"Not like a real career," she said.
I\'m really enjoying my classes and my teachers and just really enjoying the learning and taking advantage of what I have," she said.
They are turned off by a number of reasons: terrorist threats, expensive flights and hotels, long travel distances, a shortage of tourist attractions, and the hassle of obtaining visas and spectator passes.
Sochi officials have refused to say how many tickets were put up for sale, and the figure will only be released after the games.
By comparison, 1.54 million tickets were available for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, and 97 percent (1.49 million) were sold.
Heiberg, who chairs the IOC marketing commission, said the Russians have cut down by 50 percent on the number of spectators originally planned for the mountain events, for reasons of security.

Junipero Serra, the Spanish priest who founded missions up and down California, will become a saint in September, Pope Francis announced Thursday.
"Pope Francis is from Argentina and knows the history of the New World," Lopez said.
I think there will be protests," said Castillo, whose book is called "A Cross of Thorns: The Enslavement of California\'s Indians by the Spanish Missions."
Only 12 were either born in the United States or did their good works here.
Pope Francis announced Thursday that Junipero Serra, the Spanish priest who helped spread Christianity in California in the 1700s, will become a saint in September.
Junipero Serra, the Spanish priest who helped spread Christianity in California in the 1700s by building missions up and down the state, is loved by some.
"But maybe he thinks it\'s more important that he brought Christianity to the New World than what happened to the native population," Lopez said.
Becoming a saint in the Roman Catholic Church is a long process with several steps.
Many Native Americans put to work by the Spanish died of European diseases, including chicken pox and measles, because they had never been exposed to them before.
He said it is outrageous that the Catholic Church, which has apologized for how the Indians were treated, would now "canonize one of their great monsters."
It was very intense," said Senkewicz, who co-wrote a biography on Serra.

"It definitely feels different," said Navarro, of North Philadelphia, who was 11 when she arrived here from Honduras.
Their story began in the Honduran countryside.
For Turcios and her husband, it was a chance to stay legally through temporary protection offered to immigrants who are in the United States during such catastrophes in their home countries.
So, in 2002, she and her husband decided to send for their children and had them smuggled across the border for a shot at a better life.
Most of her siblings entered undetected, but one of her sisters traveling separately was stopped at the border.
And many times I wished I hadn\'t come, because of all the pressure and the feeling of having no freedom at all and not being able to go anywhere or have the same future as the rest of my friends, or go to the same schools \u2014 having to work twice as hard just to go to a two-year college," she said.
Previously, undocumented immigrants could be held in Philadelphia jails for immigration purposes.

They were waiting on this windy runway at the company\'s plant in Palmdale, Calif., to see the aircraft nicknamed "Lazarus" \u2014 the plane that died in a fire on the island of Guam only to be brought back to life.
Many of them, mechanics such as Byrne, left their families in Palmdale and flew 6,000 miles to Guam to work seven days a week for months at a time.
The military points out that the B-2 is unlike any other aircraft in the U.S. arsenal.
Because of its stealth characteristics, it is the first bomber to be sent into heavily defended enemy territory to clear the way for other fighters and bombers.
It called on expert mechanics, engineers and other technicians from the company who know the bomber best.
Every seven years, the planes fly into the facility for a full tune-up.
"I had to look it up on a map and saw this tiny dot in the middle of the Pacific."
"The extent of the damage was surprising," said David G. Mazur, a Northrop vice president.
Last year alone, the Air Force spent more than $1.2 billion upgrading, maintaining and overhauling the planes.
For each hour a B-2 is in the air, it spends 47 hours on the ground undergoing maintenance.
A B-2 mechanic must refer to 750 technical manuals to fix the plane.
Rebuilding the bomber depended on parts that were difficult to find, with some parts found on shelves at air bases in the U.S. Parts that were no longer made had to built again based on blueprints that were drawn when mechanics such as Byrne and McElhaney were in elementary school.
It called in the mechanics, engineers and other technicians from the company who know the bomber best.
"Hundreds of parts would have to be replaced."
Once there, the aircraft would undergo a complete rebuild at a cost of about $37.2 million.
The repairs required more than 1,000 parts ranging in size from small clips to massive sections.
On Guam, Northrop decided it would do the repair in two parts.
The plane, named Spirit of Washington, started right up on the first attempt.
The B-2 bomber is one of the most advanced planes in the U.S. Air Force.
The project took nearly four years, and cost more than $105 million.
All that attention to detail paid off and the plane, named Spirit of Washington, started right up on the first attempt.

Raspberries \u2014 the kind that once blanketed North American forests \u2014 cover a small patch of the farm.
Across the country, projects like the Little Earth Urban Farm are taking aim at the health problems that plague American Indian communities.
Indian adults are twice as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes as the general population, and many are seriously overweight.
Lori Watso, a nurse and Shakopee tribe member, was the inspiration for the expansive garden established on tribal land in Prior Lake, Minnesota.
Reversing that trend remains a daunting challenge.
"It\'s very difficult to change people\'s minds about something so personal as (the food) they\'re going to put into their bodies," Watso said.
Far from the wide open spaces and roaming goats in Shakopee, city farmers at Little Earth in Minneapolis work a tiny strip of once-vacant land.
They add fertile soil donated by the Shakopee tribe, which also shares seeds with this small community.
She hopes one day the city farm will become fully sustainable.
If these goals are going to be achieved, Little Earth will need the help of people like George Lussier.
In New Mexico, food programs are working to preserve seeds from hundreds of years ago.
Once harvested, the fruits and vegetables are divided among Shakopee tribe members as well as other Indian communities.
The ground is contaminated, they say, so the Little Earth farmers use raised beds.
She hopes one day the tiny city farm will become fully sustainable.

group of scientists are working together on a new device to help reduce climate change.
The team is made up of retired engineers and scientists from Silicon Valley, the area near San Francisco, California, known for high-tech companies like Apple and Google.
Their goal is to have something available "so we know what works and what doesn\'t work."
"Personally, I doubt that the world is ready for this," said Stephen Gardiner, a University of Washington professor who studies environmental policies.

"As one family member has said, this is long overdue," Obama told the single largest group to receive the Medal of Honor since 1945.
"I\'m busting with pride," said Charles Baldonado, 77, whose brother Joe R. Baldonado was among those honored after his death.
The Pentagon said some of them deserved the Medal of Honor, which has been awarded to more than 3,400 people since it was established during the Civil War.
The president singled out Florida resident Mitch Libman, who was in attendance, for helping inspire the congressionally ordered review.
John "Mac" MacFarland, a Vietnam veteran who in 1969 wrote the recommendation nominating Erevia for the Medal of Honor, was long haunted by the belief that it was his fault that Erevia didn\'t receive it.
It took decades, an act of Congress and a review of thousands of war records.
Rodela and Santiago Jesse Erevia, both of San Antonio, and Melvin Morris of Port St. John, Fla., served in Vietnam.
Erevia, the retired postal worker, choked up when the president asked him, Rodela and Morris to return to the stage together.
On Tuesday, two dozen veterans who fought in World War II, Korea and Vietnam received the Medal of Honor from President Barack Obama.
Only three are still living: a 68-year-old retired postal worker, a 72-year-old retired salesman and great-grandfather, and a 76-year-old retiree who the president noted enjoys mowing the grass for his neighbors.
"He did not even mention this ceremony to his neighbors, who I think would be pretty shocked to turn on the news tonight and see that the guy who cuts their lawn is getting the Medal of Honor."
He also called family members of veterans who had died.
Obama said that when he called Morris "his first reaction was, \'Oh, my God, what have I done?\'

"We are making sure that we have options for those who are homeless to move into an emergency shelter, and the biggest shortage in the system is shelter space for families," Ige said.
The state envisions its new transitional shelter would house about 15 families at a time, Morishige said.
Two of the sites under consideration are in Kakaako, the neighborhood where the large homeless encampment was cleared.
The recent clearing of the Kakaako homeless encampment could be used as a model in other parts of Hawaii, Ige said.
The state coordinated efforts with service providers, and moved more than half of the 300 residents, including 25 families, into shelters and permanent housing, the governor said.

At the rim of the Grand Canyon on a recent day, a crowd of visitors jostled for a prime viewing spot.
The first would alter the natural beauty of the canyon and push across park borders.
The second, a major housing and commercial development, jeopardizes the fragile ecology and water supply on the dry South Rim plateau.
Federal control extends a quarter-mile on either side of the Colorado, they say, and no development can occur any closer to the water.
"That kind of water just isn\'t around there," Uberuaga said.
The park has a stash of 13 million gallons in storage tanks, about an 18-day supply.
Half of that must be kept in reserve for fire protection.
However, it has always been difficult for anyone except seasoned hikers to reach the canyon floor.
"We want them to feel the canyon from the bottom."
When water levels drop, said park official Tim Jarrell, "we start to think about cutting back on the number of people we let in the park."
At the rim of the Grand Canyon, a crowd of national park visitors looks for a good viewing spot.
Most of the 5 million yearly visitors stop at the rim, look out and move on without ever venturing into the canyon.
Those plans do not say where the water will come from.
"We start to think about cutting back on the number of people we let in the park."
Together they are seen as the most serious threat that the park has faced in its 95-year history.
A development of that size that close to the park, he said, would seriously have an effect on "our visitor experience."
The proposed Grand Canyon Escalade gondola would give tourists an opportunity to reach the canyon floor.
If there is a development there, where are our prayers going to go?"
They expect it to decrease the small amount of water found naturally on the dry Colorado Plateau.
"That kind of water just isn\'t around there," said Uberuaga.
For now, the park is waiting for the tribe to complete its planning.
As it is, there is already not enough water.
However, it has always been difficult to reach the canyon floor.

Surprisingly, the results showed that the prefrontal cortex, traditionally associated with thinking, was most active for the drawings the participants ranked as most difficult.
If the cerebellum plays a role in creativity, it could change our understanding of how the brain works.
The traditional belief that the cerebellum is involved only in motor control comes from studies on monkeys.
The studies indicate it is a separate structure at the base of the brain that is not connected to the rest of the brain.
So Reiss, inspired by the word game Pictionary, developed an experiment.
Participants in the study were placed into a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine, or an fMRI.
Basically, the less the participants thought about what they were drawing, the more creative their drawings were.
Then it will have advanced our understanding of the how the brain develops creativity and other forms of advanced thinking.
The less the people thought about what they were drawing, the more creative the pictures were.
Most frustrating of all, the more effort and thought we put into it, the harder it may become.
Now neuroscientists might have found a clue about why it is so difficult to force that creative spark.
Their study suggests that the cerebellum, the brain region that controls muscles and movement, is also involved in creativity.
So Reiss, inspired by the word game Pictionary, developed an experiment.
While inside the machine, they were asked to draw pictures based on action words like vote, exhaust and salute.
Even more surprising, the cerebellum was busiest for the drawings the participants scored highest on for creativity.
If the cerebellum takes part in creativity, it could change our understanding of how the brain works.
It increased when the task required little thought.
Future experiments should attempt to match the tasks more closely with the control.
This supports the idea that the cerebellum helps thinking in much the same way it works in motor control.
Future experiments should try to match the drawings more closely with the control.
Scientists at Stanford University set out to explore creativity in the brain.
If so, the discovery could change our understanding of the way our brain works.
Hawthorne wanted to find out if her design class made students more creative.
While they were in the machine, they were asked to draw pictures based on action words like vote and salute.
The less the people thought about what they were drawing, the more creative the pictures were.
Future experiments should try to match the drawings more closely with the control.
Many hope the Stanford experiment can be improved and repeated.
It is vast and featureless \u2014 and yet every two to three years, sea turtles dig their nests at the same location where they once crawled out of their own eggs.
"Most likely they have tiny magnetic particles in their brains or in their bodies that act like a compass," Brothers said.
Brothers also noted that while loggerhead turtles may use geomagnetic fields to help them get back home to lay their eggs, it does not appear they rely on the information alone.
Yet every two to three years, sea turtles dig their nests at the same location where they once crawled out of their own eggs.
It is a mystery that has stumped scientists for years: How do female sea turtles navigate back to the beach where they were born when it comes time to lay their own eggs?
Yet every two to three years, sea turtles dig their nests at the same location where they once crawled out of their own eggs.
The other end \u2014 the South Pole \u2014 is in Antarctica.
When travelers use a compass to find north, they rely on geomagnetism.
Because the bar shifts constantly, its angle relative to the Earth changes over time.
The difference in how they are attracted to the magnet is part of their magnetic signature.
For example, researchers do not know how the turtles sense the geomagnetic field, which can neither be seen nor heard.
Every few years, female sea turtles return to the beach where they were born.
There are still many questions to be answered.
"They will usually decide to go nest somewhere else."
Every few years, female sea turtles return to the beach where they were born.
Geomagnetism is an invisible but very strong force.
The particular way each thing reacts is known as its magnetic signature.
It proved they can sense magnetic signatures.
An Oregon teenager has come down with the bubonic plague.
Authorities believe a flea infected the girl during a mid-October hunting trip.
The first was the Justinian Plague, which began in 541 A.D.
It was during that outbreak that scientists discovered the plague was caused by a bacteria and often spread through fleas.
An Oregon teenager has caught the bubonic plague.
During that outbreak scientists first discovered that the plague is often spread by fleas.
An American teenager is sick with the bubonic plague.
No new cases of the disease have been discovered since.
Oregon has had only eight cases of plague over the past 20 years.
In the United States overall, there were only 1,006 cases of plague between 1900 and 2012.
When bubonic plague is left untreated, the disease can spread to the bloodstream.
The final big outbreak is known as the Modern Plague.
During that outbreak scientists first discovered that the plague is often spread by fleas.
The plague killed about 50 million Europeans during the 1300s.
They sometimes carry and pass on diseases when they bite humans.
The disease is not that common.
"Archaeology is the key which gives us the understanding of all these objects," said National Geographic archaeologist Fredrik Hiebert.

However, researchers who study how different animals drink are learning that dogs might actually have a pretty smart strategy all their own.
Different animals have different strategies when it comes to getting a mouthful of water, said research co-author Sunghwan Jung of Virginia Tech University.
Carnivores, including wolves and lions, do not have complete cheeks.
Carnivores have to use their tongues to lap at liquid and bring it toward their mouths.
Then they quickly move their tongue up over and over again, each time pulling water up into the air.
Dogs are messy drinkers.
A weather condition called a "polar vortex" was expected to bring below-zero temperatures not seen in years to much of the nation.
It will affect more than half of the continental U.S. Sunday through Tuesday.
The forecast was startling: 25 degrees Fahrenheit below zero in Fargo, N.D., minus 31 in International Falls, Minn., and 15 below in Indianapolis and Chicago.
Eight to 10 inches of snow was expected to fall in central Illinois, Indiana and Michigan later Sunday, National Weather Service meteorologist Ed Fenelon said.
In Chicago, temperatures were expected to fall throughout Sunday to about 11 degrees by 5 p.m., "and from there it will be a free fall for the rest of the night," with temperatures hitting around minus 15, Fenelon said.

A 14-year-old Muslim student will face no criminal charges after he took a homemade clock to class that his teachers thought resembled a bomb, the police chief said Wednesday.
On Monday, Ahmed wanted to show his work to his engineering teacher but was warned to keep the clock in his backpack.
He was then taken out of the school in handcuffs for further questioning by the police.
School district spokeswoman Lesley Weaver declined to confirm that Ahmed had been suspended, citing privacy laws.
This spring, the city council endorsed one of several bills under discussion in the Texas Legislature that would forbid judges from rulings based on "foreign laws."
One woman declared "Shariah law is Islam, and Islam\'s goal is to immigrate, assimilate and annihilate."
"This all raises a red flag for us, how Irving\'s government entities are operating in the current climate," said Alia Salem, executive director of the council\'s North Texas chapter.
Boyd said the clock that Ahmed built looked "suspicious" but the police chief considers the case closed.
He said that more kids should be inspired like him to enjoy science, because "it\'s what makes America great."
Ahmed\'s father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, earlier said that his son "just wants to invent good things for mankind."
Boyd said police have an "outstanding relationship" with the Muslim community in Irving and would meet the boy\'s father to discuss any concerns.

After the deaths of unarmed black men in Missouri and New York, President Barack Obama created a task force to study the issue.
The panel also met with the leaders of groups fighting for the rights of blacks, Hispanics, Asians, veterans, gays, the disabled and others.
"I think it helps to drive a wedge between a local police department and the community it serves \u2014 which is exactly contrary to what the intent of this police task force was supposed to be," Bill Johnson said.
But the task force found that the cameras raise extremely complex legal and privacy issues.
And it doesn\'t happen overnight," she said.

The purpose of the gathering was not to discuss religion, however.
But he and the Vatican, which is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church, have long championed sports.
Cricket is immensely popular in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Served with tea, these have long been the favorite snack at cricket matches.
It will be fielded as early as the spring.
This idea, he said, dates from the late 19th century.
The idea was to point out the religious and educational value of sports.
London, England, is the home of cricket.
The Vatican already has a soccer tournament.
And he remains a fan of his beloved San Lorenzo club.
Cricket is very popular in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Perhaps someday the new team will play Muslims or Hindus from those countries.
And, McCarthy added, there was another reason for his idea.

"Because it\'s been in permafrost up until now, the level of preservation is just marvelous," Knecht said.
Here, however, the excavators have found whole wooden masks, bowls, bows, arrows and spears.
"There\'s been so little archaeology in Yup\'ik country that everything we find here is a revelation."
Knecht said the dates of the objects are important, because they span a particularly cold period of the so-called Little Ice Age, an abrupt period of lower-than-usual temperatures and ice advances recorded from 1430 to 1455.
The destruction was written about in court records in Europe and Asia.
"From this site, we can learn a huge amount about how people lived before and after the ecosystems changed."
But they were also old.
"This is easily the largest collection of pre-contact Yup\'ik material anywhere," Knecht said.

Romance can be rocky, and no one knows that better than the Statue of Liberty.
"I don\'t know about you, but I\'m getting a little bit tired of reopening and closing the Statue of Liberty," said David Luchsinger, the national monument\'s superintendent.
The National Park Service expected to spend about $56 million to fix Liberty Island and nearby Ellis Island, home to an immigration museum that remains closed.
As they began their climb, dignitaries and special guests gathered behind Lady Liberty for a formal ribbon-cutting ceremony.
The secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, paid tribute to the statue and to the 19 firefighters killed Sunday in Arizona, breaking down in tears as she called the fallen men "a great reminder of the importance of first-responders."
"It\'s not one of the seven or eight wonders of the world," Thibault said, "but it should be."
They included three schoolteachers from Kendallville, Ind., whose elementary school pupils sold lollipops to raise more than $400 to contribute to the statue\'s repair effort; and actor Dominic Chianese sang "God Bless America" to the crowd.

The picture-perfect beaches and turquoise waters that people expect on their visits to the Caribbean are increasingly being fouled.
A number of shorelines have been so severely hit that some tourists have canceled summer trips and lawmakers on Tobago have termed it a "natural disaster."
Mahi-mahi, tuna, billfish, eels, shrimp, crabs and sea turtles all use the algae to spawn, feed or hide from predators.
It even causes the deaths of endangered sea turtle hatchlings after they wriggle out of the sand where their eggs were buried.
If removal of seaweed involves large machinery, that will also obviously cause impacts to the beaches and the ecosystems there," said Faith Bulger, of the Washington-based Sargasso Sea Commission.
As she watched, yet more of the mats drifted to shore after crews had already trucked away big piles to use as mulch and fertilizers.
The beaches that visitors to the Caribbean expect to be picture-perfect are not looking so good these days.
We really need to have a regional effort on this," said Christopher James, chairman of the Tobago Hotel and Tourism Association.
"The smell of seaweed is terrible," German tourist Oliver Pahlke said during a visit to Cancun, Mexico.

The head of the Chicago Police Department was fired Tuesday amid widespread criticism over a fatal shooting last year.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he formally asked Garry McCarthy, the Chicago police superintendent, for his resignation.
McCarthy "has become an issue, rather than dealing with the issue, and a distraction," Emanuel said.
He added that while he is loyal to McCarthy, whom he praised for his leadership of the department, the needs of the city are more important.
Emanuel said he discussed "the undeniable fact that the public trust in the leadership of the department has been shaken and eroded."
City leaders and demonstrators have called for Emanuel to remove McCarthy, arguing that new leadership is needed to reassure a troubled public.
Last week, that spokesman said he was relaying information told to him by other people on the scene and that he never spoke with Van Dyke.
McCarthy also defended how the city has responded to the protests that have erupted since the shooting video was released last week.

In past years, militants have routinely attacked health workers and security teams carrying out vaccination drives, killing dozens.
The Khyber Agency tribal area, near Peshawar, has emerged as a new trouble spot.
In past years, Taliban militants have routinely attacked health workers and their security teams, killing dozens.
The tribal areas had more than half of the 307 polio cases Pakistan saw in 2014.
For the first time, health workers could reach families that had been inaccessible.
As a result, 86 percent of the tribal areas are now covered by the vaccine, up from 47 percent, health officials say.
"There are areas that are still not within reach, where fighting is going on, where we hope to get to sooner or later," he said.
In October, 250,000 children could not be reached by vaccination teams.
Northwest Pakistan, on the border with Afghanistan, is a rugged, mountainous area.
Pakistan is one of only three countries where polio remains endemic or regularly found.
Polio is a viral disease that mainly affects children.
In the early 1900s, polio paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year.
Most of Pakistan is free of the disease, but it has been difficult to wipe out in several pockets of the country.
These include the tribal areas, the neighboring province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the seaside metropolis of Karachi.
For years, U.S. officials urged the Pakistani military to take stronger action against militants based on its soil.
Pakistani army leaders say they have killed hundreds of militants, but the claims are difficult to verify.
Many went to displacement camps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where they lived temporarily.
Two areas, Bara and Jamrud, remain extremely difficult for health workers to reach.
Many militants have moved from the tribal areas to Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan.
The north of Pakistan is a mountainous and poor region.
It paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children every year.
This migration has increased fears that the virus could spread through the city of more than 20 million people and on to other parts of Pakistan.
In the north of Pakistan, two battles are going on.
There were 56 the same time last year.

For millions of years, the biggest dinosaurs on the planet steered clear of the tropics, and now scientists think they know why.
"It was not a happy place for them to be hanging out," said Nathan Smith of the Dinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, California.
Back in the Triassic, the land mass that is now New Mexico was closer to the equator, Smith explained.
Despite such tough living conditions, scientists did find evidence of animal life in the region: small-bodied meat-eating dinosaurs and a number of big reptiles that are relatives of modern-day crocodiles.

Some believe climate change and a mass extinction event of the big crocodiles may have had something to do with it.
Smith is also in charge of dinosaur studies at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles County, California.
The air had four to six times as much carbon dioxide as it does today.

An unusual program in Mexico allows painters, sculptors and other artists to donate artworks to the state instead of paying money.
It has also left artists such as Cito content: They are free from the bother of tax forms and the worry of owing large sums of money to the government.
If he or she sells six to eight pieces, two pieces are donated \u2014 and so on, up to a total of six pieces donated per year.
"I think it\'s fantastic," said Naomi Siegmann, a sculptor born in New York who has lived in Mexico for 50 years.
Siegmann said she got a thrill when she saw one of her pieces gracing a public space.
Siqueiros told Margain that an artist friend was facing jail time for not paying taxes.
The program was approved, and since then the Mexican government has taken in well over 4,000 works of art.
Perhaps, he said, "the committee doesn\'t have members with the background or level" to judge what\'s good or bad.
Of course, not every artist who makes a living from selling his or her work is enormously talented.
"Artists who aren\'t important today might be important tomorrow," he said.
It has helped the government build a huge collection of modern art.
It has also left artists such as Cito happy: They are free from the bother of tax forms and the worry of owing large sums of money to the government.
Siegmann said she got a thrill when she saw one of her pieces in a public space.
"They are aware that their pieces may be exhibited," said government official Jose San Cristobal Larrea.
San Cristobal said the government is careful not to pass judgment on the work collected from artists.
It has also left artists such as Cito happy: They are free from the bother of tax forms and the worry of owing large sums of money to the government.
Siegmann said she got a thrill when she saw one of her pieces in a public space.
Their goal is to decide whether they fairly represent the work of a given artist.
Instead, what the taxman wants is one of her artworks.
Cito paints colorful oil paintings, as well as chalk drawings on paper.
The program came out of a 1957 meeting between two men: tax official Hugo B. Margain and artist David Alfaro Siqueiros.
The number of works artists must give changes from year to year: It depends on how many pieces they have sold in a year.
No artist, though, is made to give more than six works a year.
It may even be shown in another country.
She had high praise for the Payment in Kind program.
Almost every artist who takes part in the program agrees.
Since then, it has taken in more than 4,000 works of art.
Lahner said the operation does make the fish look better, but she said, "my main concern is fish health."
At the Seattle Aquarium, a handful of fish have received glass eyes.
Lahner assisted Haulena and the other Vancouver veterinarians with their one-eyed rockfish last month.
Giving the rockfish a glass eye took veterinarians about 20 minutes.
Lahner uses two flat-backed eyes and glues them together to form one round eye.
In the past, fish with a missing eye would often be euthanized \u2014 put to sleep \u2014 at aquariums, because they were considered to be ugly, Haulena said.
"It\'s no longer a good idea to think of animals as disposable, and just go out and get another one," he said.
In the meantime, she will be giving several Seattle Aquarium rockfish prosthetic eyes soon.
Since getting its new eye, the rockfish seems to be back to its old self, Lahner said.
At the Vancouver Aquarium, veterinarians work hard to keep the fish healthy.
First, the fish was given anesthesia, so it would not feel pain.
For that, she used fishing line and metal clips.
There are many fish at the Vancouver Aquarium in Canada.

The major question hovering around the dwarf planet: Is it rich in water, or not?
Astronomers in the 1990s picked up the chemical fingerprint of hydroxyl \u2014 a fragment of the water molecule \u2014 in the light coming from Ceres.
"One of the most puzzling questions about the origin and evolution of asteroids is why Vesta and Ceres are so different," scientists Humberto Campins and Christine Comfort from the University of Central Florida wrote in a commentary.
"Now we have really for the first time discovered water in the asteroid belt," said lead author Michael Kuppers.
It could also simply be that exposed ice on the surface in these two areas is melting and becoming vapor when the sun hits it.
Whatever is going on, the larger question remains: Why is Ceres so wet?
"I\'m excited to see what Dawn is going to find out," said Kuppers.
However, a study in 2011 could not back that claim up.
It could be that heat from inside the planet is causing the water to rise up and explode into blasts of water vapor.
The Herschel Space Telescope, which is still in space, ran out of the coolant needed to keep its instruments working last year.

People who live in the rugged Western states are enduring another summer of destruction from the flames.
Colorado saw the worst wildfire in its history this year.
The worst year was 2006, when 9.8 million acres burned.
Lawmakers in the Western states have called on the federal government for more help and criticized its management of public lands.
The U.S. Forest Service says about 65 million acres of its land is at "high or very high risk of wildfires."
While hot and dry weather is beyond the control of the authorities, the states can tell people where to live to put them at less risk from wildfires.
Much of the new population is building houses in zones at risk of wildfires.
In the 1990s, 61 percent of newly built homes in Washington, Oregon and California were inside this area.
By 2000, about 42 percent of all homes in those three states were in the danger zone.
Researchers at Colorado State University expect the inhabited fire zones will triple in size in Colorado by 2030 to 2.1 million acres.
Rasker is with a nonpartisan think tank in Montana.
State and local leaders play a huge role in fire policy by setting laws on zoning and construction.
He believes that if this problem was sorted, the other issues would just fall into place.
Other new policies could make the inhabitants of the fire zones more responsible for their decisions to move in.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s inspector general wrote that zoning and building regulations may be needed to "make landowners take the actions necessary to protect their homes and property from wildfire."
Many authorities have enacted strong fire-proofing measures, but many more go without protection.
This is also often true in the actual communities at risk from the wildfire.
Some states have tried to make these areas safer.
Landowners in Oregon are given fines if they break these rules.
Two task forces are talking about protection fees, new insurance regulations, building code changes and brush-clearing rules.

Texas, Utah, Colorado, Washington and Arizona are all at risk from fires.
People moving next to the wilderness is not new.
In the 1990s, 61 percent of newly built homes in Washington, Oregon and California were in the area near the wilderness.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture\'s inspector general wrote that regulations may be needed to "make landowners take the actions necessary to protect their homes and property from wildfire."

Up to now, Harper Lee has only published one book.
The arrest of Rosa Parks in 1955 led to the yearlong Montgomery bus boycott.
Harper Lee herself is from Monroeville, Alabama, but lived in New York in the 1950s.
At the time, she told one reporter she wanted "to leave some record of small-town, middle-class Southern life."
The new book also will be available as an electronic edition.
Lee has openly expressed her preference for paper, but surprised fans last year by agreeing to allow "Mockingbird" to be released as an e-book.
Harper Lee\'s "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a classic read in schools and book clubs around the world.
"After much thought and hesitation, I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication.
Lee is from Monroeville, Alabama, and lived in New York in the 1950s.
According to the publisher, the book will be released as she first wrote it, with no changes.
"Reading in many ways like a sequel to Harper Lee\'s classic novel, it is a compelling and ultimately moving narrative about a father and a daughter\'s relationship, and the life of a small Alabama town living through the racial tensions of the 1950s."
Still, she surprised fans last year by agreeing to allow "Mockingbird" to be released as an e-book.
"It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort."
She now lives back in her hometown.
Still, she surprised fans by allowing "To Kill a Mockingbird" to be released as an e-book.
"In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called \'Go Set a Watchman,\'" said Lee, 88.
While "To Kill a Mockingbird" is set in the 1930s, "Watchman" is set in the mid-1950s, roughly the same time that Lee was writing the story.
In 1953, the Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools \u2014 schools separated by race \u2014 were unconstitutional.
Lee is from Monroeville, Alabama, and lived in New York in the 1950s.
The book has occasionally been banned over the years because of its language and racial themes.
Still, it has been required reading in many middle schools and high schools, and is common in book clubs.
Still, she surprised fans last year by agreeing to allow "Mockingbird" to be released as an e-book.
"To Kill a Mockingbird" follows 6-year-old Scout Finch, her brother Jem, and their father Atticus Finch, a local lawyer who defends a black man falsely accused of serious crimes.
The new book revisits some of the same characters about 20 years later.
Lee has rarely spoken to the media since the 1960s.

In a project that began five years ago, scholars, students and Quinhagak residents are working together to carefully take apart, document and save relics from a sod house site they call "Nunalleq," or old village.
Had the work not started when it did in 2009, thousands of artifacts at the site would have washed away.
Village leaders work with elders and the scientists in decision-making: when to dig, how to preserve the site, what to do with the finds.
Pieces of model kayaks that show the history of the design.
Until the permafrost began melting and the edge of the tundra eroded into the sea, the old village was well-preserved in the hard-frozen earth.
Just in the past five years, 30 feet at the edge of the dig has been lost.
Had the work not started when it did in 2009, thousands of artifacts at this one village would have washed away.
Of those, as many as 5,000 are special enough to show in a museum, Knecht said.
Fienup-Riordan, the anthropologist, collected stories from Quinhagak elders about the objects found.
One elder, George Pleasant, knew the stone used for an ulu blade by its color.
The artifacts support and add detail to the stories of the village, Knecht said.
What the elders say adds new explanation.
Quinhagak may be just the start, Knecht said.
Other ancient Alaska villages along the coast and on rivers are eroding too.
Then the village was attacked and burned down around 1640 by a neighboring settlement during the area\'s "Bow and Arrow Wars," he said.
In just the past five years, 30 feet at the edge of the dig has been lost.
"I think it\'s the best thing anybody came and helped us do," elder Annie Cleveland said.

Dinosaurs were long thought to have lived only on land.
Spinosaurus had a long thin snout with teeth that jutted diagonally from its mouth \u2014 perfect for snapping at fish.
Its small nostrils were far up on its skull \u2014 ideal for breathing while partly submerged.
The differences run from head to toe.
Spinosaurus was discovered in Egypt in 1912 and first described by German scientist Ernst Stromer in 1915.
It was a rich collection of leg, foot and rib bones \u2014 and the same strange blade-shaped fossils with the red line running through.
Armed with that tiny bit of information, they returned to Erfoud \u2014 a Moroccan town of more than 20,000 people \u2014 and searched for him, with no luck.
Ibrahim decided he needed to find the man with the box.
It now seems, however, that their uniqueness and true appearance have not been understood.
In 1944 the bones were destroyed in a bombing raid during World War II.
Aside from the careful drawings Stromer had made, all evidence of the discovery was lost.
One was a strange blade-shaped fossil with a red line running through it.
Stromer took the skeleton with him back to Germany.
But the bones were destroyed during World War II.
Inside the box were ancient bones.
Scientists there told him about some strange fossils in the museum basement.
Now, strange dinosaur bones found in Morocco may prove them wrong.
New evidence shows it spent much of its life in water.
Spinosaurus dinosaurs have been known about for years.

The government has long asked climbers to clear their trash, but there was no way to check what people brought down.
The government did not say what action it would take against climbers who descend without the 18 pounds of trash.
And many climbers have succeeded only with help from oxygen tanks, equipment porters and Sherpa guides.
Instead, private trekking companies organize climbs and report any problems.
Nepalese sometimes attribute climbing deaths to bad karma earned through disrespecting the mountain.
Sagarmatha means "forehead of the sky" in Nepali, while the Tibetan name for Everest is Chomolangma, or "goddess of the snow."

"Nobody knows who they are, how their trial was conducted, who appeared before the prosecutor, and who represented the accused," Khan said.
Malala first emerged as a celebrity in 2009 after admitting to being "Gul Makai," the author of an Urdu-language diary about life under Taliban rule.
For that, she was targeted for killing by terror chief Mullah Fazlullah, who also is from Swat.
She was evacuated to Britain for medical care in a United Arab Emirates government airplane and underwent surgeries to restore her eyesight and hearing.
Pakistan freed eight of the 10 men accused in the shooting of teenage Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai.
"This is totally beyond comprehension," said Sher Mohammed Khan, a Swat-based lawyer and representative of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.
Malala survived because of a global effort to save her life.

Pakistan freed eight of the 10 men accused in the shooting of teenage Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai.
At the time, it had been widely reported that all 10 men had been convicted by an anti-terrorist court.
Public skepticism about Malala began to lessen only last September, when the military announced it had caught her attackers.

After recovering, Malala won admirers around the world.
And experts say the practice is growing so rapidly that it will soon become the most common way to steal goods.
They included: 80,000 pounds of walnuts worth $300,000 in California, $200,000 worth of Muenster cheese in Wisconsin, and rib-eye steaks valued at $82,000 in Texas.
Hughson Nut Inc. fell victim twice last year, losing two loads valued at $189,000.
The economic results go beyond adding a few cents to retail prices.
When the truckers show up at a company, everything seems in order.
The thieves target mostly shipments of food and drinks, which are easy to sell illegally and hard to trace.
Others go to huge warehouses like the one authorities raided in August in North Hollywood, Calif.
So far this year, the number of fake pickups has probably already doubled, Coughlin said.
For instance, someone wanting to steal a truckload of copper would target shipments coming out of Carrollton, Ga., where a major copper-wire manufacturer is located.
One reason food shipments are popular targets is because they have a lower value than electronics or medications, which are often more heavily protected.
The California Farm Bureau Federation warns about clues that could indicate a suspicious hauler: temporary name cards or identification numbers on the truck, abrupt changes in the time of the pickup, and the lack of a tracking system on the truck.
And experts say the practice is growing so rapidly that it will soon become the most common way to steal cargo.
The most common crime is still the theft of trailers left alone in parking lots or at truck stops.
Of the average three to five truckloads stolen each day in the United States, at least one involves a fake pickup.
Thieves around the country have come up with a simple way of stealing cargo.
And experts say the practice is growing so fast that it will soon become the most common way to steal goods.
A generation ago, thieves would drive loaded trucks out of parking lots.
Another idea is to get a thumbprint from the truck driver.
And experts say the practice is growing so rapidly that it will soon become the most common way to steal cargo.
But then the industry had started using tracking devices, high-tech locks and other protection.
Now, thieves are changing how they do business, too.
Prices rise and unsafe food and drugs could reach store shelves.
News reports across the country have told of a few of the thefts.
It is a theft-prevention network that provides information to the insurance industry.
They load the goods onto their own tractor-trailers and then drive away.
This type of crime has become more common.

New Jersey has so few little brown bats that there may soon be no more left.
Back then, there were about 30,000 in New Jersey.
Scientists estimate that 7 million bats, of many types, have died across the country since white nose was first detected in a cave near Albany, New York, in 2006.
The fungus leaves a white powder on their noses, ears and wings.
All of the little brown bats would have to live through the winter to start replacing the ones lost to the disease.
Others are studying a different fungus that might be stronger than the white nose fungus but would not kill any bats.

But Biden has avoided calling publicly for Beijing to retract the zone, wary of making demands that China is likely to snub.
Rather, the vice president hoped to persuade China not to enforce the zone or declare similar zones over other disputed territories.
When Biden arrived later at the Great Hall of the People, a ceremonial building steps away from Tiananmen Square, any tensions between the United States and China were papered over.
"To strengthen dialogue and cooperation is the only right choice facing both of our countries," Xi said.
He said, "Children in America are rewarded \u2014 not punished \u2014 for challenging the status quo."

"The domestic dog, one of our closest companions in the animal kingdom, has followed us to every continent of the world," the study notes.
One of the groups of dogs returned to northern China around 10,500 years ago.
For instance, what might have caused East Asian dog populations to genetically branch off from wolves in the first place?
When did dogs and humans start living together?
People and dogs have been living together for hundreds of years.
All dogs, from huskies to Chihuahuas, are the descendants of wolves.
For instance, what caused East Asian dogs to branch off from wolves in the first place?
The story of exactly how dogs came to be remains a mystery.
One idea is that wolves in Asia became cut off from each other.
Then, a group of South Chinese wolves were on their own.
Or it could have happened the other way around.
It is possible that some wolves started living with people before they became dogs.
There is still much to learn, though.
How exactly dogs came to be remains unclear.

"It brings people back to a simpler time, before million-dollar contracts, TVs, cars, steroids and gloves," said Bruce "Early" Leith.
Leith also serves as president of the Eclipse Base Ball Club of Elkton, Maryland.
Baseball legend says the game was invented in 1839 by Abner Doubleday in Cooperstown, New York.
One of the biggest differences between then and now is that fielders could catch a batted ball on one bounce to make an out.

Oysters started dying by the billions along the Northwest coast in 2005.
In 2005, when no young oysters survived in Willapa Bay at all, farmers blamed the luck of nature.
After two more years with essentially no new oysters being born, panic set in.
When the tiny oysters raised there are big enough to produce shells, they are mailed back to Washington and planted in Willapa Bay.

They took out loans and moved half their company 3,000 miles away.
The next year, it struck a Taylor Shellfish hatchery, which gets its water from Hood Canal.
Whiskey Creek hatchery closed for weeks at a time.
And no one could tell them what was wrong.

Scientists cautiously linked the deaths to falling ocean pH in 2008 and 2009.
By the early 2000s, he was seeing a huge change off the West Coast.
The acidic water surfacing off Washington, California and Oregon came from CO2 that entered the sea 20 or 30 years earlier.
Even if gas and oil burning immediately stops releasing CO2, West Coast sea chemistry would worsen for almost as long before leveling off.
But over the next 10 years the world will have to make significant progress tackling this problem.

"It\'s actually kind of exciting because it\'s water yet again on Mars, but it\'s in a different material than we had recognized," said geologist John Grotzinger.
"So what Curiosity is doing is just demonstrating that water is present in a number of ways."
Another of the studies focused on the rock known as Jake M., named after NASA engineer Jake Matijevic, who died shortly after the rover landed in 2012.
"It looks like it was headed in more of a direction like Earth."
New information suggests that Mars may have small bits of water spread around its surface.
What has scientists excited is that Curiosity has found tiny traces of water.
The water is in dust that seems to be covering the entire planet.
This told scientists that it had been created under high pressure \u2014 and perhaps in water.
New discoveries are making scientists change some old ideas: They now suspect that Mars may be more like Earth than they thought.
It found that there are two major types: One is coarse, and probably came from surrounding rocks.
But it does match soil found where other rovers have landed.
Curiosity used another of its tools to cook up a tiny bit of soil: It turned out that roughly 1.5 to 3 percent was made of water.
Mars may be more like Earth than people think.
"It\'s actually kind of exciting," said John Grotzinger.

President Barack Obama unveiled expansive executive actions on immigration Thursday night to spare nearly 5 million people in the U.S. illegally from deportation.
"To those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill," Obama said.
As Obama spoke from the White House, immigration supporters with American flags draped over their shoulders marched on Pennsylvania Avenue carrying signs that read, "Gracias, Presidente Obama."
The address marked the first step in the White House effort to promote the executive actions to the public.
"The president will come to regret the chapter history writes if he does move forward," said Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is soon to become the Senate majority leader.
Obama will expand eligibility to people who arrived in the U.S. as minors before 2010, instead of the current cutoff of 2007.
It\'s been worth the pain and sacrifice," said Jesus Zuniga, a 40-year-old who picks tomatoes in California\'s Central Valley and watched the speech in Fresno.

Now, in an ironic turn of events, Chinese companies are looking to manufacture in the United States, lured by lower costs of energy, cotton and land.
Keer decided to relocate part of its yarn production line to Lancaster, in a $218 million investment.
Feeling the competition intensify, Keer looked toward the Carolinas, after ruling out Vietnam, India and Pakistan as potential destinations.
"The cost difference between the two countries has certainly been narrowed greatly in recent years," Ling said.
Now, there are 20 to 25 Chinese companies visiting South Carolina to evaluate investment opportunities every year, according to Ling.
Keer, a textile company headquartered two hours from Shanghai, China, is building yarn manufacturing lines in Lancaster.
That would be welcomed in Lancaster County, where the pain of lost textile jobs is still felt by many.
Carolyn Summers worked for Springs Industries in Lancaster for 42 years before being laid off in 2005.
The greater region lost about 26,000 jobs at textile mills in the past 20 years, according to the Federal Reserve.
Since the factories closed, "we haven\'t had the luxury of textile here.

For wealthy foreign visitors, it is the ultimate African experience: the thrill of hunting a lion, the mighty king of the jungle.
Palmer first wounded Cecil with a bow before fatally shooting him with a gun after 40 hours of tracking.
Palmer, who said he relied on his professional guides to ensure a legal hunt, has been criticized globally on social media and talk shows.
There is also an increasing phenomenon of lion owners charging tourists to pet and cuddle cubs earmarked for trophy kills when they get older, he added.
Hunting "is a source of much needed foreign exchange, job creation, community development and social upliftment," South Africa\'s Environment Minister Edna Molewa said.
"Our goal is to understand the threats that lions face, and to use cutting-edge science to develop solutions to those threats," Director David Macdonald said.
"Short of going on a culling exercise where you are just shooting animals willy-nilly in order to reduce numbers, there is need to have a scientific way of doing it," he said.
This year, Zambia announced the lifting of a 2-year-old ban on hunting lions and other big cats.

By one estimate, fewer than 20,000 lions exist in the wild, a drop of about 40 percent in the past 20 years.

For some wealthy foreign tourists, it is the most exciting African experience of all: hunting a lion, the mighty king of the jungle.
They say a dead animal was tied to a car to draw the lion out of the park.
Around 1,000 are fatally shot every year by trophy seekers who pay an average of about $20,000, and sometimes up to $50,000.
Some conservationists, however, believe the figure is inflated to support the argument that tourist hunting is good for South Africans.
Another estimate puts the number at closer to 30,000.
"The last and final contact is usually done at close range, with the lion appearing from nowhere in the green foliage.

"The Kenyan government is pleading with our mujahedeen inside the mall for negotiations," it said in a Twitter message.
"I ran back and hid behind one of the cars."
We will defeat them again."
Shabab said the bombings were to punish Uganda for taking part in the African Union mission.
Kenyatta said in his television address that the military and police operation at the mall was "delicate" because the top goal was to save the lives of hostages.
Umar Ahmed, 18, told Kenyan television he was in the rooftop parking area when he heard shooting and screams.
Another witness told Citizen TV that he saw a foreign gunman change clothes and mingle with people escaping the mall.
A gunman saw him and threw a grenade toward him.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said there were no reports of Americans being killed.
The Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the U.S. were committed by al-Qaida.
Witnesses who escaped the attack said gunmen fired at people from an upper floor.
By Sunday, attackers were still holding an unknown number of innocent people in the mall.
"There will be no negotiations whatsoever at Westgate," the Shabab wrote on Twitter.
The Twitter account was suspended shortly afterwards.
Kenyan media reported that two suspects had been killed.

Last week, Minnesota school bus driver George Nathaniel was fired for leading kids on his bus in Christian prayers after being warned to stop.
"I let them know I am a pastor and I am going to pray," he said.
When Nathaniel continued to lead prayers on his new routes, Durham sent him a letter dated Oct. 30, saying: "There have been more complaints of religious material on the bus as well as other complaints regarding performance.
Durham spokeswoman Molly Hart said, "The company does not have a specific policy on the subject of prayer."
"Then each person will pray if they want to pray.
School district communications director Ruth Dunn declined to comment on the prayers but said, "We do consider the school bus to be an extension of the school day when it pertains to student behavior and support."
"The school bus driver has the right to pray on his own time, but when he has a captive audience of kids on a school bus, that would violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment," she said.

Gayla Colin, a bus driver for 13 years in the district, says she "absolutely" sees her time on the bus with kids as part of the school day.
Nathaniel said he talked to parents as he saw them at bus stops, let them know he was a pastor, and asked if it would be OK for him to pray with the kids on the bus.

Now the city is ready to take an active place in the next environmental push \u2014 using rooftops to grow food.
He believes there are at least 13 rooftop farms in the city, although he said there could be more.
He believes agriculture inside cities can help us to improve how we grow and distribute food.
The former mayor of Chicago, Richard M. Daley, got the idea after seeing a rooftop garden on a trip to Germany.
In the years since, green roofs have gotten a lot of attention.
Philadelphia reported more than 1 million square feet.
Chicago wanted to promote city farming, so in 2011 it passed a law allowing rooftop farms to be built in the city.
Method began a partnership with Gotham Greens last spring.
Gotham Greens was looking for a place in Chicago, and Method reached out and suggested a partnership.

Rooftop farms are sprouting all around Chicago.
These days, though, they are his canvas for intricate designs and hang in galleries where they sell for hundreds and thousands of dollars each.
The pieces consist of animal bones, mostly skulls, into which Borders has engraved and inked complicated designs of lines and dots.
Borders says he remembers always making things with his hands and taking classes presented by the Lexington Art League.
"The garage was right underneath my house, and I ended up filling the house with bone dust, and made myself really sick and made my wife really angry."
He says they draw a wide range of reactions from "little old housewives who think they\'re really disturbing" to "people closer to my age who are like, \'Oh, that is so hard-core, bro.\'"
"I will often go trade with local farmers, like do a couple hours work or trade them a small piece of art for a bunch of bones."
Even before he started school, Jason Borders tended to collect unusual objects.

Before long, it may well be genetically modified salmon, the first such altered animal cleared for people to eat in the United States.
He said that the fish is a\xa0"game changer that brings healthy and nutritious food to consumers in an environmentally responsible manner without damaging the ocean and other marine habitats."
The FDA has set up guidelines for stores who do want to label the fish, along with additional guidance for voluntary labeling of genetically modified plant foods.
They also fear it could lead to the eventual decimation of the natural salmon population if it escapes into the wild.
"There\'s no place on our dinner plates for genetically engineered fish," said Lisa Archer.
She and other Alaska and Pacific Northwest lawmakers said they will swiftly push for legislation to mandate labeling of the modified fish.
The agency said that there are "multiple and repeating levels of physical barriers" in the facilities to prevent the escape of fish.
The salmon has an added growth hormone from the Pacific Chinook salmon that allows that fish to make growth hormone all year long.
Engineers have been able to keep the hormone active by using another gene from an eel-like fish called an ocean pout.
She went to the Senate floor to criticize the FDA shortly after the announcement, saying she was "spitting mad."
She and other Alaska and Pacific Northwest lawmakers said they will swiftly push for a law to require labeling of the modified fish.
Typical Atlantic salmon make growth hormone for only part of the year.
The fish grows twice as fast as regular salmon, reaching the size it needs to be when sold more quickly than regular salmon.\xa0 A company named AquaBounty makes the engineered salmon.
It should be available in grocery stores in that time, AquaBounty said.

SHINGTON \u2013 Spring is off to a deadly start in the Midwest, where floodwaters have killed at least four people and driven thousands from their homes.
Many of those are in the Northeast.
Attorney Lisa Blatt, for Oklahoma, said the lack of gauges in the basin makes it nearly impossible to tell how much water each state is drawing, and whether they are sticking to a four-state agreement.
That type of flood killed at least 26 people in May 2010 in Tennessee and Kentucky.
Warnings can save lives and money, studies by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Service (NOAA) have found.
But the USGS was able get enough local support to keep them running -- for now, at least.
New York recently faced the threat of dozens of shutdowns, including many gauges in the Susquehanna River Basin, one area of the country most at risk of flooding.
Susan Obleski, of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, said she was glad the money came through, but it will only last four months.
Though the proposed budget has a slim chance -- if any -- to wriggle through Congress, Norris takes it as a sign that politicians, even those trying to pinch pennies, see the value of the gauges.

Forecasters said more people could have died if there were no river gauges.
The United States has 8,000 gauges to quickly track the rise of rivers.
Experts say shutting the gauge stations could have really bad results.
The government says 145 stations already have been shut.
The cutbacks threaten to slow down flood warnings.
Just a one-hour warning can cut damage by 10 percent.
Information was very important this month, said Mark Walton, manager of the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Grand Rapids.
Without the gauges, "we would have basically been flying blind," he said.
He said money is needed to keep the gauges running everywhere.
President Barack Obama on Monday launched a non-government program to promote opportunities for men and boys of color.
"These are big problems in America, and he is in a special position to get people talking about them."
Thurber added, "He\'s likely to be more effective in that way than by trying to pass legislation in trying to deal with them."
Obama\'s concern for men and boys of color "started long before he was in the White House and will last long after he\'s closed the doors to that building for the last time," DuBois said.
In conversations with staffers, Obama has repeatedly returned to the idea that the real problems require a serious, lasting effort, DuBois said.
It plans to do this primarily through educational and intervention programs designed to close what Obama called the "opportunity gap," boosting education and employment rates that lag behind those of their peers.

The president of the University of Missouri system resigned Monday over his handling of racial tensions at the school.
One student had gone on a hunger strike a week ago.
"This is not the way change comes about," he said, referring to recent protests, in a halting statement that was at once apologetic, clumsy and defiant.
Head football coach Gary Pinkel expressed support for his players on Twitter, posting a picture of the team and coaches locking arms.
A statement issued by Pinkel and Missouri Athletic Director Mack Rhoades linked the return of the protesting football players to the end of a hunger strike by Jonathan Butler, a black graduate student.
A swastika drawn in feces also was found recently in a dormitory bathroom.
The association said in a letter Sunday to the system\'s governing body that there had been "an increase in tension and inequality" on campus since last year\'s fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, which is about 120 miles east of Columbia.
His death helped spawn the "Black Lives Matter" movement criticizing police treatment of minorities.
The president of the University of Missouri resigned Monday.
Wolfe urged students, teachers and staff to use the resignation "to heal and start talking again to make the changes necessary."
The protests began after the student government president, who is black, said in September that people in a passing pickup truck shouted racist insults at him.
At least 150 students gathered at the plaza Sunday night, a larger crowd than on previous days.
One of the sit-in participants, black student Abigail Hollis, said the campus is "unhealthy and unsafe for us."
The president of the University of Missouri said he will give up his job.
Many planned to camp there overnight, even though temperatures had dropped into the upper 30s.
The student government declared that Wolfe "has undeniably failed us and the students that we represent."

Alice Munro, whose short stories capture the everyday lives and sudden revelations of men and women in rural Canada with elegant and precise prose, won the Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday.
Munro is the first Canadian writer to receive the prestigious award from the Swedish Academy since Saul Bellow, who left for the U.S. as a boy and won in 1976.
Munro told Canadian broadcaster CBC she was "surprised and delighted" at the news, which she heard in a predawn phone call from her daughter.
She won a National Book Critics Circle prize for "Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage" and is a three-time winner of the Governor General\'s prize, Canada\'s highest literary honor.
Munro is the 13th female literature winner in the 112-year history of the Nobel Prizes.
Canadian short story writer Alice Munro won the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday.
"She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to come a little bit in the shadow behind the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection," Englund said.
In a 1994 interview, she said she made a mistake in trying to write "Lives of Girls and Women" as a regular novel.
Her storytelling talents resurfaced but her marriage collapsed.
The story is about a woman who begins losing her memory and agrees with her husband that she should be placed in a nursing home.
"I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win," the 82-year-old told The Canadian Press in Victoria, British Columbia.
In a 1994 interview, she said she made a mistake in trying to write "Lives of Girls and Women" as a regular book, or novel.

The Nobel Prize in Literature is one of the highest awards a writer can receive.
Munro once said she made a mistake in trying to write "Lives of Girls and Women" as a regular novel.
She tended to write about her experience there and her life after the social revolution of the 1960s.

"I think the Long-Range Strike Bomber is absolutely essential to keep our deterrent edge."
In few places can the lure of a new bomber be felt more deeply than Palmdale, California.
According to Ledford, Northrop executives said they would build substantial parts of the bomber in Palmdale, creating about 1,500 jobs.
They also want it to one day be flown remotely as a drone.
The Air Force plans to order as many as 100 of the new planes as soon as late spring.
He estimated that the new stealth bomber program would ultimately cost $90 billion \u2014 or about $900 million for each plane.
The Air Force is already spending billions of dollars to update its current fleet of 150 bombers.
The Congressional Budget Office has repeatedly said the new bomber program could be cut.
In fact, for years, officials may have been secretly paying for it to be developed, analysts said.
Last year, congressional analyst Jeremiah Gertler said it seemed that the new bomber had already been built and was being tested.
Lancaster Mayor Parris said the bomber could create jobs throughout the area, including at restaurants, stores and manufacturing suppliers.
For elected officials across the country, however, the bomber means one thing: jobs.
Todd Harrison is an expert at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.
The United States wants to build a new top-secret warplane.

China has abandoned its "one-child policy," the government-controlled state news agency Xinhua reported Thursday.
Wang called it "great news" even if the effects of the change will take a generation or more to possibly reverse population trends.
Money concerns and the cultural norms around having one child meant many families decided to stay as they were.
China has dropped its "one-child policy," the national news agency Xinhua reported Thursday.
Wang called it "great news" even if the effects of the change will take a generation or more to be seen.
"This really marks a historic point to end one of the most controversial and costly policies in human history," he said.
Meanwhile, the number of people aged 60 and above will approach 400 million, or a quarter of the population, in the early 2030s.
Money worries and the fact that people were used to the idea of having only one child meant many families decided to stay as they were.
For years people in China have only been allowed to have one child.

Ayub convinced other boys working in shops and restaurants in the neighborhood to study with him in the middle of the market for an hour or two.
Over the years, Ayub has been joined by a small army of volunteers, including a retired school principal, a doctor and a fireman.
Ayub is gradually becoming a legend among his students, part of the dedication that led Irfan Siddiqi, who works for the prime minister, to nominate him for the "Pride of Performance" award.
Students love him so much that they have marked out land where they plan to bury him when he dies.
Abbas still remembers when Ayub found him cutting down wood in a neighborhood forest to make money for his family and persuaded him to come and study.

Now, however, she and other students like her are receiving more attention under a new state law and programs by Los Angeles Unified and other school districts.
The law requires the state to define and identify a "long-term English learner," the first attempt in the nation to do so.
It has identified nearly 350,000 students in grades six through 12 who have attended California schools for seven years or more and are still not fluent in English.
In addition, Fairfax High Principal Carmina Nacorda said more than 70 percent of her 125 long-term English learners have educational disabilities.
In Los Angeles Unified, about one-third of the 600,000 students are learning English and more than 35,000 of them are still not at grade level after five years.
What helped him to succeed?
"I should be more confident in English because I was born here, but I\'m embarrassed that I haven\'t improved myself," Dasha said.
A 2010 study by the group found that many students did not improve because schools failed to monitor their progress, provide appropriate courses or train teachers.
On a recent morning, she and her classmates watched a "60 Minutes" TV news program on Los Angeles Lakers point guard Jeremy Lin.

Fishermen in the Solomon Islands are used to hunting dolphins for their meat and teeth.
The study looked at one village called Fanalei, where the hunt was popular.
Then, in 2013 the deal broke down and hunting began again.
During just the first three months of 2013, the villagers killed at least 1,674 dolphins.
The International Whaling Commission protects whales, but it does not look after small marine mammals such as dolphins.

Curtis Morrison was homeless, had legal trouble and needed medicine after moving to Seattle from the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana.
The idea began at the end of 2006, according to Lael Echo-Hawk, who was president of the Northwest Indian Bar Association.
A city area also lacks the support base common on a reservation.

They hope the listing will provide a stronger legal case to release Lolita than did a previous lawsuit.
"Lolita has been part of the Miami Seaquarium family for 44 years," said Andrew Hertz, Seaquarium\'s  general manager.
She would be accompanied by familiar trainers who would "reassure her every bit of the way," he said.
The controversy over releasing captive whales has been heightened by the experience of Keiko, a captive orca that starred in the 1993 movie "Free Willy."
He says Keiko never was able to catch fish on his own, and that he continued to seek out human contact at every opportunity.
Simmons wrote a book called "Killing Keiko," which accuses the release effort of leading to a long, slow death for the orca, which he says lacked food and then succumbed to an infection.
"It\'s not really the fact that Keiko died, but how he died," Garrett said.
Possible causes for the decline are reduced prey, pollutants that could cause reproductive problems and oil spills.
She would be accompanied by familiar trainers, who would "reassure her every bit of the way," he said.
Simmons wrote a book called "Killing Keiko," which accuses the release effort of leading to a long slow death for the orca.
"Lolita has been part of the Miami Seaquarium family for 44 years," said Andrew Hertz, who runs Seaquarium.
"He loved it."
Garrett said what matters is not "the fact that Keiko died, but how he died."
His group hopes a San Juan Island cove near Washington state will one day serve as the site for Lolita to re-enter the wild.
Under the Endangered Species Act, it is against the law to harm or mistreat a protected orca.
Garrett said the plan for Lolita calls for her to be taken to a netted area of the cove, which could be enlarged later.
She would be accompanied by familiar trainers, who would "reassure her every bit of the way," he said.
In 1998, Keiko was brought back to his native waters off Iceland in an attempt to reintroduce him to life in the wild.
He was released into the ocean in 2002 and died in a Norwegian fjord in 2003.
Simmons wrote a book called "Killing Keiko," which accuses the release effort of leading to a long slow death for the orca.
"Lolita has been part of the Miami Seaquarium family for 44 years," said Andrew Hertz, who runs Seaquarium.

Garrett said what matters is not "the fact that Keiko died, but how he died."
They also believe it is wrong to force her to perform in shows.

He was released into the wild in 2002 and died in 2003.
They also think it is wrong to force her to perform in shows.
On Wednesday, the government said that Lolita is still a Puget Sound orca.
They are in the dolphin family and are very large.
Males can grow as much as 30 feet long.
There are now fewer than 80 wild Puget Sound orcas left.
Howard Garrett works with a group called the Orca Network.
There, she could be prepared to re-enter the wild, he said.
"Lolita has been part of the Miami Seaquarium family for 44 years," Hertz said.
Between 1965 and 1975, many Puget Sound orcas were captured for aquariums.
They also think it is wrong to force her to perform in shows.
She would first be taken to a netted-off area of the bay.
People who get up and do even 30 minutes of light activity can improve their health, researchers said.

On Wednesday, Shaun White abruptly withdrew from slopestyle.
These games cost roughly $51 billion to stage, but have been beset by concerns over safety, cost overruns, human rights and construction woes.
It is hosting the games for the Olympics for the first time since the Soviet Union broke up.
Earlier this week, a favorite in the slopestyle competition, Torstein Horgmo of Norway, fell on a jump during a practice run.
They met with athletes and tweaked the 2,083-foot-long course.
Athletes also reported that rails \u2014 which are used to stage tricks and stunts \u2014 were too sticky and needed to be waxed.
White "made a sound athletic decision," said Jeremy Forster, the USSA\'s snowboarding and free-skiing director.
Slopestyle was fast-tracked into the Olympics only three years ago, an unusual departure for the International Olympic Committee.
One of its most well-known competitors, Canadian freestyle skier Sarah Burke, died in a training accident two years ago.

Retailer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has agreed to change controversial rules about how its employees can dress.
The popular retailer agreed to change the rules to better protect women wearing the hijab, said lawyers for Hani Khan.
Khan was fired from a part-time job in 2010 at a store owned by Abercrombie because she refused to remove her hijab.
"If it could happen to me in the Bay Area, it could happen to anyone," said Khan.
Khan said the last 3 1/2 years have been a "roller coaster."
Khan was hired in 2009 at Hollister in Hillsdale Shopping Center.
Abercrombie did not admit it broke the law.
Abercrombie said Monday that it was glad to put these "very old matters" behind it.
She is a lawyer who represented Khan for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
But lawyers will watch the company closely to ensure it follows the law, she said.
Hani Khan got a job working at a Hollister store near San Francisco in 2009.

Low-income teens may gain more than an academic boost by attending top-notch high schools.
Still, lead author Dr. Michael Wong said the results echo findings in other research studies and seem to confirm the assumption that "better education will lead to better health."
Better schools may lead to healthier kids, according to a new study.
Doing well in school is "just so critical for people\'s well-being," he said.
Better schools may lead to healthier kids.
Good schools may also help them to be healthier, a new study suggests.

Pontius saw students with head lice miss weeks of school.
Pontius persuaded the district to change its rules.
"Head lice just gets everyone overexcited."
The CDC estimates that each year 6 million to 12 million U.S. children between the ages of 3 and 11 are infested by lice.
She does not send a general notification letter to other parents for fear of causing panic.
She believes the bugs move among hats and coats on racks or among students working close together.
To find out, Pontius consulted with experts.
She contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a government agency that works to stop outbreaks of illness.
She also got in touch with the American Academy of Pediatrics, a group that represents doctors who treat children.
So it seemed reasonable that students being treated for lice could remain in class.

And even though he writes a blog about a fictional janitor character called Jon E. Mopp, Bergum has never sought fame.
"He can do anything," said Terry Duty, Tahoma High\'s principal, who has worked with Bergum for nearly 20 years.

The leading Republican presidential candidates gathered for their first debate last Thursday.
I want to run as the Republican nominee," he said.
The top 10 candidates, ranked based on national polls, took the stage \u2014 with Trump at the center \u2014 before a crowd of 5,000.
Trump had tried to play down his debut, saying he did not have as much experience debating as others.
"It\'s fun, it\'s kidding, we have a good time," Trump said.
"If you don\'t like it, I\'m sorry."

On Thursday, California workers poked hollow aluminum tubes into meadows of the Sierra Nevada mountain range to measure the snowpack.
"We will conceivably see more years like this in the future," said geologist Jeffrey Mount of the Public Policy Institute of California.
On Thursday, the snowpack was just 25 percent of average for this time of year.
A dry January is partly to blame.
But the snowpack is also skimpy because warm storms that hit the state in December dumped heavy amounts of rain, not snow.
Dealing with the rain was not a problem in December, when storms drenched California with 180 percent of average precipitation for the month.
Three years of severe drought meant that big reservoirs had plenty of room to absorb the surge of rainwater.
Dams are operated according to a set of rules developed for each reservoir by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and written into federal law.
They consist of pen-and-ink drawings that show the exact reservoir level that managers are supposed to maintain on a given date.
"The trick is, they\'ve all been custom-done based on historical" water levels, state climatologist Mike Anderson said.
asked Iris Stewart-Frey, a professor of environmental studies at Santa Clara University, who has studied shifts in the timing of the snowmelt.

On Thursday, California workers poked hollow aluminum tubes into Sierra Nevada meadows to measure the snowpack.
The snow melts gradually over several months, trickling down mountains into rivers and reservoirs in the spring and early summer.
The reservoirs fill just when the need for drinking water and water to irrigate farmland goes up.
They are operated according to a set of rules developed for each reservoir by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
They are studying whether the rules should be changed because of the warming climate.

They will both now be replaced by Republicans who opposed the gun restrictions.
The new Colorado laws limit gun magazines to 15 rounds and require universal background checks, among other restrictions.
The party has a much larger majority in the state House, enough to block any legislative effort to overturn the gun laws.
A group of sheriffs has also filed a lawsuit to overturn the gun laws.
Democrats Morse and Giron were vital figures in turning the strict gun legislation into law.
Morse and Giron passed sweeping gun control measures last winter after several mass shootings in 2012.
Colorado was also the scene of the Columbine High School massacre in 1999.
Grass-roots activists launched the campaigns against Morse and Giron even before the new law was actually signed.
What began as a local effort quickly gained national attention.
Advocates on both sides of the gun control debate hoped to either frighten or strengthen lawmakers around the country who might be considering similar laws.
Both sides poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into the campaign and fought fiercely in the days leading up to the vote.
The same newspaper said in August that Bloomberg had donated $350,000 to help the state senators.
With the loss of Morse and Giron, the Democratic hold on the Colorado state Senate has shrunk to just one seat.
Giron, a freshman lawmaker, would have faced re-election in 2014.
"If it cost me my political career, that\'s a small price to pay."
She said that she had no regrets about voting for the stricter gun laws.
They also demand background checks on every gun owner.
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg supported Morse and Giron.
It turned the vote into an intense debate in Colorado and across the United States.
This was after several mass shootings in 2012.
Morse said he would continue to fight for gun control.
He thinks that the laws he made make Colorado safer.
Some believe there should be more rules on who owns guns.
The NRA thinks that there should be no more gun laws.
The people who do not believe in gun control want another vote in 2014.
She hoped to win re-election next year.
The trouble was, she was not doing much of anything with her baby.
The difference between the two zoos is that the Lowry Zoo has a chimp mom who has raised two adopted chimp babies.
Carole was chosen as a chimp who would make a good mom.
But Keeva is still a lucky chimpanzee.
If this had happened in the wild, she probably would have died.
While Keeva was in Baltimore, her handlers took every step possible to make her think she was being raised by one of her fellow chimps.
They held her all the time, wore fur clothes, groomed her and made chimp noises to her.
She may have been too young to realize it, but the 17-day-old chimp was getting a special treat.
The pilot flew his own plane from Florida to Maryland so Keeva could be transported safely and comfortably to her new home.
Mother and adoptive daughter seem to get along, and the other chimps have been keeping an eye on things.
School nutritionist Leah Schmidt has always loved solving one particular puzzle: How do you serve up healthy meals that picky children will actually eat?
"It used to be fun playing with things, letting kids pick things," Schmidt said about menu planning.
As things are, schools already have responded to weekly limits on calories, sodium and fat while meeting rising expectations on nutrients, grains and meats \u2014 all depending on the ages of students.
Soon the puzzle may become too hard, Schmidt fears.
Since the new standards were first introduced in 2012, the number of children participating in [lunch and breakfast programs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch) has fallen by 1.2 million, from 31 million to less than 30 million.

In the summer of 1914, American author Henry James knew that something had been lost forever.
"You and I ... should have been spared this wreck of our belief that through the long years we had seen civilization grow and the worst become impossible," he wrote.
"It seems to me to undo everything, everything that was ours, in the most horrible retroactive way."
Few did so as thoroughly and as terribly as World War I, which began 100 years ago this month.
"If you look at the 19th century, you have this whole notion of progress through technology," says Jan Schall, an art historian at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri.
The war destroyed the dream.

In 1917, artist James Montgomery Flagg was asked by the U.S. government to create a poster that would encourage young people to join the military.
He added a simple tagline: "I Want YOU For U.S. Army," shortened in popular memory to "UNCLE SAM WANTS YOU."

Fogle is accused by Russia of spying for the CIA while he worked as a low-level U.S. diplomat in Moscow.
The State Department remained tight-lipped and tried not to make a big deal of the incident.
"I doubt he had this kit on him," he said.
"It was planted on him for political theater."
But Peter Earnest, who worked 36 years at the CIA, said it was possible a CIA agent would use a compass and wigs during an undercover operation.

Flashback to a jazz club in the 1940s.
"These are the successful cultural rebels of American culture," said Joel Dinerstein, a professor and jazz scholar at Tulane University.
No presidents past or present passed the test for defining cool, though curators considered Obama, Clinton, Reagan and Kennedy.
To be included, a person had to have an original artistic vision with a signature style, represent cultural rebellion, have instant visual recognition, and have a recognized and lasting cultural impact.
The most difficult section to curate was what remained of cool from the 1980s onward, Goodyear said.
To be included, a person had to have an original artistic vision with a signature style, represent cultural rebellion, have instant visual recognition, and have a recognized and lasting cultural effect.
So the exhibit also includes an alternate list of 100 names at the end who the curators argued about the longest.
"People who are young can tell their grandparents who Jay-Z is and why he is important."
The 100 who made the cool cut include musicians, actors, athletes, comedians, activists and writers.
Where did the term "cool" come from?
"I\'m cool," he said, relaxed in the moment.
In the show there are more men than women represented.
What might seem like a made up list of 100 celebrities was actually much-debated.

It was narrowed down from 500 names, the curators said.
To be included, a person had to have an original artistic vision with a signature style, rebel against society, be instantly recognizable, and have a lasting cultural effect.
That period was followed by the birth of cool in the jazz years with musicians like Young, Holiday, Muddy Waters and Duke Ellington.
Someone like Jay-Z is "selling in" to have more power in the culture, rather than selling out, Dinerstein said.

With PCR, a special enzyme is added and the DNA is heated up to 94 degrees Celsius (202 degrees Fahrenheit).
"You could run this and they can say, \'Yep, you have a bacterial infection, here\'s the antibiotic,\' or \'it\'s a virus, go home and rest.\'"
The amplification now takes only three minutes, but other preparations make the whole process longer.
In that technique, cold water is passed over a porous copper platform holding the microscopic samples, rapidly dropping the temperature to 55 degrees C (131 degrees F).
Dr. John Leamon, a biological researcher focused on health care, said rapid PCR could be a valuable tool in other areas where time is a key factor.
A consumer version of the device, he added, would take at least five to seven years to bring to market.
It takes about three minutes to run the 30 cycles needed to enlarge the DNA to a size where it can be identified.
The whole cycle repeats 30 times, and the results are then matched to a known genetic signature.
As speedy as the process is now, Wheeler thinks the team can go even faster.
Within a year or two, he adds, getting results in less than 10 minutes will become common.

The eggs, which cost from $4.99 to $8.99 a dozen, are sold across the country in Whole Foods Markets and other natural-foods grocers.
According to a survey by Vital Farms, most consumers were unfamiliar with the term "pasture-raised," and the majority thought that "cage-free" and "free-range" meant the birds have been raised outdoors.
Their pasture-raised organic eggs can cost as much as $8.99 a dozen compared with $4.69 for standard organic eggs.
In 2006, Michael Cox, a chicken farmer in northwest Arkansas, faced a tough choice.
His family had been raising chickens for three generations, first for a big company and then for themselves.
What started as a Texas farm with just a few thousand birds now works with about 60 farms and produces 1.5 million eggs every week.
Matt O\'Hayer, the founder, added: "Our job is to show people that an egg is not just an egg."

Fiesler said she first heard about the book on Tuesday, when it began circulating online.
Fiesler said her website had about 800 all-time visits before the project, and has nearly 50,000 now.
"If I\'d known it was going to blow up like this, I would have proofread it a little more," Fiesler said, adding that the response has been almost entirely positive.

So if players have permanent homes in the St. Louis area or elsewhere, they may think twice about buying into the Los Angeles real estate market \u2014 especially given how expensive it is.
That is more than three times the median price of $160,000 in the St. Louis area, according to the National Association of Realtors.
An agent might get paid 2 percent to 3 percent of a lease they help arrange.
They hope to build up relationships with players now, which could lead to more business later on.

Gift-giving has long been a staple of Chinese life, but its means and expectations are increasingly colliding with more modern anti-graft laws.
The crackdown started in earnest last month with the beginning of the holiday season, which got underway with the Sept. 19 Mid-Autumn Festival.
Or a $3 million villa on the French Riviera, the key piece of evidence in the bribery trial of former Chongqing Communist Party Secretary Bo Xilai.
The gift-giving tradition is an offshoot of the intense competition in China, where a large population fights for education, health care and jobs.
Activist Luo said that his family paid 100,000 yuan \u2014 about $16,000 \u2014 in cash at a public hospital two years ago when his grandfather was having surgery for colon cancer.
Parents in his hometown, he added, have to pay at least $3,200 if they want to transfer their child to a better school.
Gift-giving is a popular subject on the Internet, with ambivalence expressed by those receiving as well as giving.
To highlight the problem of graft in government, Chinese activists have enlarged photographs of officials to zoom in on expensive watches that they would not be expected to to be able to afford.
Each time a new leader comes in, he sets a fire and starts to crack down very hard on corruption," said Qiao Xinsheng, a professor at the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law.
"China has always been a society of guanxi," or connections, said economist Hu Xingdou.
Hu, the economist, said that enforcement of anti-corruption laws in China remains uneven.
"We couldn\'t possibly hold all Chinese officials to the same standard because if we did, there would be no officials left standing."
"I\'m absolutely disgusted by it, but this is how our system works," said Luo.
"Gift-giving is a must, but you should avoid extravagance," advised the official state paper, the People\'s Daily.
Gifts of luxury brands, wine, expensive cigarette and large amounts of cash were all warned against.

If it had also won the fighter competition, it would have held a near monopoly on Air Force combat jets.
But it faced a huge problem.
The next year, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta directed the Air Force to allow F-22s to fly only near potential landing sites in case a pilot experienced oxygen loss.
The GPS-guided bombs that took out the systems were delivered by F-22 Raptors, Mayville said.
In 2009, then-Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates ended the purchases at 188 planes, saying they were too expensive.
The problem led officials to ground all F-22s for nearly five months in 2011.
The next year, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta directed the Air Force to allow F-22s to fly only near landing sites.
The bombs that blew up the systems were delivered by F-22 Raptors, Mayville said.
But after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Moscow never built those fighters.
So it sat in hangars while other U.S. warplanes dropped bombs on targets in Afghanistan.
There was no call for it in the fighting above Libya.
The bombs that destroyed the systems were dropped by F-22 Raptors, Mayville said.
The Air Force got its last F-22 in 2012.
The "smart" bombs were dropped by F-22 Raptors, Mayville said.
The F-22 Raptor fighter jet flew in combat for the first time this week, participating in airstrikes over Syria.
The group has already taken control of land in Iraq and Syria.
But those F-15s still represent the majority of a so-called "air superiority fleet" \u2014 the jets that are supposed to overpower enemy aircraft and gain control of the sky.
The next year, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta directed the Air Force to allow F-22s to fly only near landing sites.

Researchers had thought that the cluster in the Amundsen Sea region of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would last for thousands of years.
In the second study, researchers at the University of Washington focused largely on the Thwaites Glacier.
The disappearance of the Thwaites could cause sea levels to rise 2 feet.
The Washington study determined that the Thwaites could melt in as little as 200 years or as long as 1,000 years.
If the entire ice sheet disappeared, the sea level around the planet could rise 15 feet.
"Eventually, this could lead to the (end) of ice across Antarctica," Rignot said.

In November, federal agents arrested a Georgia man accused of printing more than $1 million in phony $50 bills.
Investigators say Heath J. Kellogg and his five accomplices sold the fake money for real currency, or used it to purchase expensive items that they would later return for cash.
Authorities say Kellogg put paper through a printer to give it a yellowish tint.
By doing this, he was able to recreate the watermark.
The forgery was good, but not good enough to fool Secret Service investigators.
In fact, the Secret Service began almost 150 years ago, after the Civil War, when counterfeiting was so common that almost one third of the money in circulation was phony.
The Treasury Department includes many complicated details in its bills to combat counterfeiting.
For example, new bills have color-shifting ink, which turns from copper to green when you tilt them.
Not all of the fake bills are made in the United States.
Counterfeiting money is a serious crime and those who are found guilty of doing it face a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.
Counterfeiting hurts innocent people because the government does not replace your money if you receive a fake bill.
They should be evenly spaced.
Look at the person pictured on the bill such as Abraham Lincoln on the $5 or Andrew Jackson on the $20.
Examine the bill closely for extra-fine red and blue fibers that are part of the paper.

Every morning at Corona del Mar High School, students hustle out of shiny BMWs and head to class.
"I think it\'s insulting \u2014 it demeans girls," said Andrea Fine, the mother of two students, a boy and a girl, at the school.
Over the weekend, school principal Kathy Scott sent an email to parents about the draft and urged them to discourage their kids from participating.
"It is not OK for any student to be objectified or judged in any way," the letter said.
Before the message was taken down, a tweet from one male participant proclaimed, "Many drafters on the prowl tomorrow for #freeagents so dress nice ladies."
The email said the female students were not ranked or rated.
She later founded a nonprofit group, Rewrite Beautiful, to prevent eating disorders.
She said, "When you hear that over and over, it just becomes the norm.

The latest problem is an NFL-style "draft" to pick prom dates.
They "were generally applauded," one email said.
The prom is a dance, usually at the end of the last year of high school.

From Fenway Park to the Charles River, the Red Sox celebrated their winning season by carrying the World Series trophy through Boston.
Then he and catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia held Red Sox jerseys with the words "BOSTON STRONG" and the number 617, the city\'s area code.
"To bring the World Series trophy to the finish line, I don\'t think that the story was written that way, but I was glad to be a part of it."
The closely knit team won the title with a 6-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 6 on Wednesday night.
Some boats even had brown carpeting cut into the shape of beards attached on the front.
A truck carrying Dropkick Murphys, a band that had played at the ceremony, became stuck in the turf along the first-base line.
A duck boat drove up in front of it and, with a tow rope between the vehicles, pulled the truck free.
From their stadium to the river, the Red Sox carried the World Series trophy through the streets of Boston.
The team won the World Series with a 6-1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 6 on Wednesday night.
Some fans also were at rallies after the 2004 and 2007 championships.
"It is the best thing that could have happened to Boston right now."
The Red Sox celebrated their winning of the World Series with a parade that stretched through Boston.
"That\'s going to bring back a lot, and a lot of uncertainty at that moment," Farrell said, "because no one knew where to turn next."
It was the first time the Red Sox won the Series in Boston in 95 years.
"This may be the best parade yet," said Charles Butler, 48, of Boston.

A Batman bib-and-booties costume for $14.99 caught the eye of Joanna Robles as she searched for something for her baby son to wear while she hands out candy on Halloween.
"His dad is really obsessed with superheroes," Robles said while strolling through a Spirit Halloween store near Los Angeles.
"My wife gives me a budget for Halloween and I always exceed it," he said.
It has grown into a major consumer holiday that now includes 18- to 34-year-old millennials and older adults who seize the opportunity for a night to escape reality.
"It\'s not just for kids trick-or-treating anymore," said Trisha Lombardo, a spokeswoman for Spirit Halloween, which has 1,150 temporary stores that are open just for the Halloween season.
"I post stuff after I pick out my outfit," especially on Facebook and Instagram, Jessica Medina, 33, said as she shopped at the Spirit Halloween store.
"The growth that\'s occurred in Halloween spending over the last 10 years has almost mirrored that of the growth in social media."
That is mainly because "Halloween is not a gift-giving holiday" much beyond candy for the kids, National Retail Federation spokeswoman Kathy Grannis Allen said.

Officials in Washington, D.C., have rarely paid much attention to the Bureau of Indian Education.
But that might all be changing.
He says the money is important for making sure Native American students can go to school in safe buildings.
In the 1800s, the federal government signed treaties with Native Americans promising that their children would be able to get an education.
However, the children that do go to tribal schools perform worse than Native Americans who attend public schools.

After 36 years of space travel and months of heated debate among scientists, NASA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 left our solar system and indeed entered interstellar space more than a year ago.
At a Thursday news conference in Washington, officials said the belated confirmation was based on new key evidence involving space plasma density.
The antennas, which are connected to a radio transmitter, detect the vibration of plasma particles.
Fortunately for Voyager scientists, the antennas picked up two long-lasting vibrations.
"We really needed to measure plasma to know if we were inside or outside the heliosphere."
Plasma density was increasing in a straight line as Voyager moved farther from the heliosphere and into the interstellar medium.
SA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 indeed left our solar system and entered interstellar space after 36 years of space travel.
At a Thursday news conference in Washington, officials said the delayed confirmation was based on new key evidence involving space plasma density.
Lead author Don Gurnett said information from the spacecraft showed conclusively that Voyager 1 had exited the heliopause \u2014 the bubble of hot, energetic particles that surrounds our sun and planets \u2014 and entered into a region of cold, dark space called the interstellar medium.
A functioning PLS would have been able to sense the rising density as Voyager exited the heliosphere.
The only trouble is that something has to excite the plasma for it to "ring."
SA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 indeed left our solar system.
But NASA scientists said they could not be certain Voyager had left the solar system until magnetic fields around it changed direction.
But voyager does have two antennas that stretch from its base in a wide V shape.
Thirty-six years ago the spacecraft Voyager 1 took off from Earth.
It was published online Thursday in the journal Science.
Gurnett said that Voyager crossed the edge of the heliosphere around Aug. 25, 2012.
SA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 indeed left our solar system and entered interstellar space after 36 years of space travel.
At a Thursday news conference in Washington, officials said the delayed confirmation was based on new key evidence involving space plasma density.
The first was in October and November of 2012 and the second was in April and May of 2013.
SA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 indeed left our solar system.
Voyager 2 is expected to reach interstellar space sometime within the next several years.
Thirty-six years ago the spacecraft Voyager 1 took off from Earth.
SA confirmed Thursday that Voyager 1 indeed left our solar system.
They decided that the magnetic field change was not necessary to show that the spacecraft had left the solar system after all.
It can be a large solar flare.
The spacecraft was also launched in 1977.
Thirty-six years ago the spacecraft Voyager 1 took off from Earth.
"Voyager has boldly gone where no probe has gone before," said NASA\'s John Grunsfeld.
The something can be a large solar flare.
Thirty-six years ago the spacecraft Voyager 1 took off from Earth.
It is now the first spacecraft to enter deep outer space, or interstellar space.
This is a measure of the amount of very small pieces found in gas that comes from our sun and other stars.
Don Gurnett said information from the spacecraft showed that Voyager had left the heliopause.
It entered into a region of cold, dark space.
The number of high-energy pieces from inside the heliosphere had dropped.
But NASA scientists said they could not be certain Voyager had left the solar system.
They decided that the magnetic fields did not have to change to show that the spacecraft had left the solar system after all.
The device takes an important measurement.
They stretch from its base in a wide V shape.
The antennas can tell how fast space plasma particles bounce around, or vibrate.
What color were winged dinosaurs?
Alison E. Moyer, now a Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University, says the oval-shaped "microbodies" might simply be impressions left by very old bacteria.
"You have these little structures that look very similar, and so we have to be careful," said Moyer.
The study has prompted a heated social media response from one researcher who favors the interpretation that the shapes are melanosomes, or pigment granules.
The only sure way to answer certain questions about the ancient world would be to travel back in a time machine.
She compared the bacteria with the pigment granules inside the feathers, as well as with the impressions found in ancient feathers from winged dinosaurs.
The size, shape, and other characteristics suggested bacteria, though it is still possible that they were pigment granules, she said.
One showed oval-shaped bacteria on a chicken feather, the other depicted similar-shaped impressions found in a feather from Archaeopteryx.
"It\'s always good to take one step back," said Johan Lindgren, a professor at Lund University in Sweden.
"There\'s a ton of work that needs to be done," said Moyer.
Scientists think the blobs are clues to the colors of winged dinosaurs.
The dark shapes in the two images look about the same size.
"It\'s always good to take one step back," said Johan Lindgren.
"There\'s a ton of work that needs to be done," Moyer said.
The graininess of the image makes it a bit hard to tell who is right.
They are just one-millionth of a meter long.
The other showed similar-shaped impressions found in a feather from an Archaeopteryx.
He says they are four times as long as the impressions in the Archaeopteryx feathers.
Another scientist who has said the shapes were pigment granules thought the Moyer study was useful.
"It\'s always good to take one step back," said Johan Lindgren.
So how did the other scientists find anything out about the color of dinosaur feathers?
"There\'s a ton of work that needs to be done," Moyer said.
Since this is impossible, Moyer found a living time machine: a chicken.
Paleontologists think birds are modern dinosaurs.
The other showed similar-shaped impressions found in a feather from Archaeopteryx.
Moyer says that the bacteria are closer to twice the length of the impressions on the Archaeopteryx feathers.
Bacteria are very small living things.
The size, shape, and other things suggest the spots are bacteria.
The other showed similar-shaped impressions found in a feather from Archaeopteryx.
He says they are four times as long as the ones in the Archaeopteryx feathers.

The latest figures released in mid-December by the Education Department showed wide differences in graduation rates according to where students live.
The District of Columbia had the lowest rate: 61 percent.
For the nation, the graduation rate for the 2013-14 school year was up almost a percentage point from 81 percent the previous year.
Though showing progress among subgroups of students, the latest figures drew concern from groups campaigning for a 90 percent graduation rate by 2020.
However, he said those gains are "not rapid enough to close these graduation gaps in a way that will get us to our goal" of a 90-percent national graduation rate.
The data showed that African-American and Hispanic students made progress in closing the achievement gap with white students.
In 2008, the George W. Bush administration ordered all states to begin using this method, moving to a calculation that required them to track each student individually.
The bones in the pits piled up over about 200 years, they wrote.
Researchers emphasized several factors that suggest the remains belonged to cats that had developed a unique relationship with farmers.
The closeness of the two skeletons to each other suggests the cat might have been tamed, experts say.
Unlike the Egyptian cats, which were often shown sitting under chairs, the cats of Quanhucun were hardly house cats.
Once people gave up their wandering, hunter-gatherer ways, their agricultural settlements became like buffets for cats.
The closeness of the skeletons to each other suggests the cat might have been tamed, experts say.
Scientists in China have found the first clear evidence of cats living among humans.
Today, every house cat in the world comes from a single type of Middle Eastern wildcat.
That raises the question of how the cats got there.
Marshall and her partners hope DNA tests will clear up matters.
The discovery was of eight bones from at least two cats.
The bones in the pits piled up over about 200 years.
Part of a jawbone from one Chinese cat had very worn teeth.
They can see whether it mostly ate plants or meat.
Wildcats, they believe, were probably drawn to farming areas.
There were plenty of food scraps there and an easy supply of rats and mice.

A majority of Americans now support same-sex marriage, in contrast to just a few years ago.
"This court is not a legislature (and) our Constitution does not enact any theory of marriage," Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said.
Some had thought Roberts might join the majority, but he wrote a 29-page dissent to say why he thought the matter should be decided by lawmakers.
Obergefell had sued the state of Ohio for refusing to recognize his marriage after his husband, John Arthur, died.
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined with Kennedy to make a majority.
Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. also voted against it.
That surge of support for gay marriage was set off two years ago when the high court struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act.

The Supreme Court has given gay couples the right to marry across the country.
However, its meaning goes far beyond the 20-year-long battle for gay marriage.
They called it an effort by justices to take over a matter that should be decided by state lawmakers.
Kennedy described gay marriage as a struggle for equal rights.
They wanted him to say discrimination against gay people is the same as discrimination against African-Americans or women.
She said that would make it clear that the government cannot discriminate against gay people.

No disrespect to the cigar-chomping, World War II prime minister, they say.
Yet nobody of their gender has been deemed worthy of being added onto British money, which Criado-Perez calls morally bankrupt.
And that was after King hinted, before stepping down at the end of June, that novelist Jane Austen was strongly in the running to knock Charles Darwin off the 10-pound bill.
Her record of nearly 64 years on the throne may soon be beaten by another woman (Elizabeth II).
Even Criado-Perez confesses to knowing little about her or her work in prison reform.
But there are plenty of other women who have made important contributions to history and deserve a spot on a bank note, activists say.

The Postal Service lost $15.9 billion last year.
But the savings have not been enough to match the big drop in revenue.
"We are in real trouble, " Mickey Barnett, chairman of the Postal Service Board of Governors, told Congress last month.
A plan to replace doorstep delivery with curbside delivery, which would save $4.5 billion, failed to pass last year.
The year after the Act was passed, the Postal Service showed a loss of $5.1 billion.
Package delivery has increased 14 percent in recent years as more people shop online.
But the savings have not been enough to match the drop in postage sales.
The Postal Service and its employees agreed to the 2006 law because at the time it looked as if the service could afford it, said congressional and union staffers.
Postal workers are quick to point out what the service does well.

Students taking the SAT college entrance exam will no longer have to write an essay as of 2016.
It will instead "focus on words students will use over and over again," said College Board President David Coleman.
The math problems will be more linked to real-life questions.
Some experts said making the essay optional sends a bad message.
"I\'m not sure it is a good signal to kids in schools about the importance of writing," said Katy Murphy.
Now test takers are allowed to use calculators for math questions.
It has so far only been offered in the traditional paper form.

There, beneath distinctive blue and gold onion domes, as the cathedral\'s leader prays for "calm and security for all Ukraine," parishioners peel away to visit two donation boxes.
He is the director of the Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies, a research center in Kiev, and a longtime top adviser to the Ukrainian military.
The Ukrainian military has come up with a budget plan in recent years to modernize the creaking Soviet weapons and machinery it relies on that calls for about 131 billion hryvnia a year, about $11.3 billion.
For instance, he said there was a widely accepted notion that Ukraine would like to use [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone).
Ukraine has lost three helicopters and had one pilot and one crew member killed on spy missions over the locations of pro-Russia separatists.

Rare, striking and never-before-seen portraits of black citizens in Victorian-era England are going on display for the first time in the U.S. Organizers say the photographs have a powerful message for modern-day Americans divided by racism.
"There\'s a healing aspect to seeing these exquisite images," said Vera Ingrid Grant, director of the Cooper Gallery of African &amp; African American Art.
Life-size black-and-white prints are mixed with small snapshots, some from privately owned collections.
They show ordinary people and the somewhat well-known posing for portraits in their Sunday best.
They show that blacks of the era not only were very present in daily public life but also prospered and enjoyed a certain dignity and social standing.
Many of the more than 100 photographs on display were taken for "cartes de visite," or calling cards \u2014 small, wildly popular postcards with a striking image and a bit of text.
In turn, that fresh understanding can "change how we view the present."
They range from students and businessmen to artists, military men, missionaries and international royalty.
The collection of photos was originally put together by British art historian Ren\xe9e Mussai.
A large group of old photos was discovered not long ago.
They can be seen at the Cooper Gallery of African &amp; African American Art in Massachusetts.
It may make historians look more closely at old, forgotten photos here.

S ANGELES - A science paper was recently accepted by 157 science journals.
Even with these problems, a whopping 157 journals accepted it; only 98 rejected it.
The journals that did accept the fake paper demanded as much as several thousand dollars to publish it.
There are no phone numbers listed for the journal or its officers.

The Florida bonneted bat is so rare that scientists know of only one group of them in the wild.
Her group of volunteers found bats near the Gables Granada Golf Course.
Some bats pollinate plants and others eat large amounts of insects.
Bohn helped write a study about bat singing.
Bats sing from their nests and they sing when they fly.
At their first bat night at the golf course, hundreds of volunteers wandered around or sat in lawn chairs looking into the night sky.
Bohn and volunteers studied calls and the comings and goings of bats.

In fact, voters in Maine this month passed a measure to strengthen their 1996 campaign finance law by making additional public money available to candidates running for governor and the Legislature.
Congress instead opted to let voters check a box on their tax returns to donate $1 toward the public financing of campaigns.
Mahon and others also suggest that the release of the vouchers early in elections will be advantageous to incumbents and well-known candidates with political machines ready to start collecting them.
It could be an unfair advantage.
Mueller said he would have to check on what images from the drones were actually kept.
But he said that they were limited to particular needs and particular cases.
But NSA Director Keith Alexander said the programs have helped stop more than 50 terror attacks.
Poachers have already killed 350 rhinos in South Africa this year and 668 endangered rhinos died for their horns in 2012.
"We statistically re-create the environment of when the incident happened," Snitch explained.
"On nights when this happened, where were the rangers deployed?
"I think we should just pull out all the stops and say this cannot happen on our watch, and we cannot let rhinos go extinct.

The United States has used secret unmanned airplanes to kill hundreds of suspected terrorists across the world.
Hundreds of the endangered animals are killed for their horns every year.
Professor Tom Snitch thinks that using drones could be a very valuable tool in catching the poachers.
He feels he might be able to use his mapping knowledge to help crack down on poachers.
Snitch will begin working over the next few days on a private farm next to the reserve.
The project will gather information about previous poachings, then put it into a mathematical formula.
This data will include the weather, the number of poachers working and exactly where they were in the park.
And then you put animal movement patterns on top of it," the animal lover added.

When the Chicago Blackhawks take the ice, Michelle Secor is dressed in her team clothing, watching every play, every goal.
"I have to cheer for our home teams," Secor said as she took a break from watching the Stanley Cup finals last week.
Hockey for years has been watched and played primarily by whites, experts said.
There have been more minorities on NHL rosters in recent years than in the decades before.
The percentage of fans who are minorities is up, though slightly, too, the league said.
But the league has tried to reach out to youth in urban communities.
The league is getting exposure in new Chicago neighborhoods by other means, too.
There are few opportunities to learn the rules and not a lot of places for minorities to play, said Richard Lapchick of the University of Central Florida.
"Once there are some African-American star players in the game, that will help.
The cost of the sport is another hurdle, experts said.
"The problem with hockey is that it\'s not a sport you can go in your backyard and play," said Jimmy Terracino, director of operations at the Bobby Hull Ice Rink in Cicero.
Still, there are efforts to develop interest in the sport among minorities.
Vic Ortiz, who is Mexican-American and lives on the South Side, considers himself a big Chicago sports fan.
But for years, he took little interest in the Blackhawks because the games were too expensive and most of the home games were not televised.
Gertrude Johnson, who is African-American and lives on the Near North Side, grew up watching the Bears and Bulls, she said.
Then she learned the rules of the game, admiring the speed of the players and the way they stick up for and protect each other.
"Anybody who is making a name for Chicago, we\'re riding with them," Johnson said.
Michelle Secor is big Chicago Blackhawks fan.
She is one of a small but growing number of minorities who have become hooked on hockey.
"It makes us all feel good to see a Chicago team out there winning\u2014race doesn\'t matter," she said.
Of that, 9.4 percent are Latino, and about 8.3 percent are African-American.
"The value of diversity for the NHL is that it would greatly expand their fan base."

In an unexpected move, House Speaker John Boehner said on Friday that he would resign from Congress at the end of October.
He later announced his decision at a news conference.

If biologists are right, the wolf and his mystery mate would be the first known wolves to breed in the Oregon Cascades in 100 years.
At 6:30 a.m., OR7 was photographed walking by one of the remote cameras.
Now, with wolf packs solidly re-established and widely ranging in the West, state wildlife officials say it is likely California will be home to a number of wolves within 10 years.
"He\'s certainly been there and checked it out."
This month, they took pictures of a black wolf squatting to urinate.
The two wolves had never been photographed together, which made it hard to be sure.

Cuban blogger Yoani Sanchez says her new digital newspaper is just weeks away from its debut.
The publication will include the usual news as well as investigative reports, sports, interviews and profiles, Sanchez told the Hispanicize conference Tuesday in Miami.
She hopes the publication will be inserted into so-called Combos, which are DVDs and other large memory formats recorded with massive amounts of information such as movies and telenovelas, which is Spanish for TV shows.
Sanchez drew laughs when she noted that because the Cuban government refuses to issue work permits for independent journalists, she obtained a license for the closest type of work, typist.
Sanchez added, however, that people abroad should support the growing area of private micro businesses known as "self employment."
Yoani Sanchez is known as the author of the popular blog Generacion Y, about life in Cuba.
The staff is also working on several backup ways of distributing the reports and getting around the government, Sanchez added.

"We\'re not seeing any evidence of declining growth rates," said Steve Sillett, a forestry professor and nationally known U.S. redwoods expert.
But so far the lack of fog may have allowed more sunlight to reach the trees, said scientist Todd Dawson.
They conducted studies to re-create the weather from centuries ago, and took core samples to learn the ages and growth rates of the trees.
As part of the latest study, he discovered the oldest known coast redwood tree in existence.
Some scientists say if that rate of increase keeps up, temperatures, rainfall and fog levels at the southern end of the redwood range in California will become unsuitable to support redwoods by 2100.
So the project will need to study how seedlings and trees on the edges of the redwood range fare as the climate continues to change, Dawson said.
Climate change is melting glaciers.
Or the trees might even like the higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Many years of work to limit forest fires may also be helping.

Moving around her whole life has made 13-year-old Claudia Morales an expert in packing.
Eventually, about 90 percent of kids living in seasonal workers housing drop out of school, according to Human Agenda, a nonprofit human rights group in San Jose.
"We are not aware of members of families being in jams or having a problem with having to move away," said Guerdon Stuckey, of the California Department of Housing and Community Development.
Morales \u2014 wearing a large straw hat \u2014 joked with nearby planters, all bent at the waist, as loud music blared over the field.
After Thanksgiving, she moved to Palo Verde Union School in Tulare, a newer school in a low-income community.
In the labor camp, Claudia knows just about everybody.
In Tulare, her family shares one room of a mobile home in a dangerous neighborhood.
"But when I grow up I expect to have good work and buy a house where we can stay permanently."
He said some families are not looking for permanent housing.

"They\'ve lost everything in Syria and all they have in Lebanon is the interest in their children\'s future," she said.
More than 2 million of those who should be in school are still in Syria, where classrooms have been bombed, used as shelters or turned into military shelters.
The conflict has unleashed massive suffering across all parts of Syrian society, but the impact on children has been especially rough.
With no end to fighting in sight, Syrian refugees are desperate to get their children the most basic education.
Anas was in fourth grade when his city of Homs in central Syria was attacked nearly three years ago.

Jay Fry, the head of identiMetrics, said biometric identification is used in more than 1,000 school districts in 40 states from Alaska to Long Island, New York.
In cafeterias, for example, schools can replace traditional student ID cards with machines that can read small portions of a fingerprint.
"We want to know exactly how it\'s being used \u2026 so we don\'t sacrifice too much privacy."

Blackey said that Scouting is not promoting a different religion.
"We\'re teaching them the same things their parents are," the adviser added.
Afghan Scouting has a long way to go.
During the dark years in Afghanistan, loyal Scouts were forced to hide their uniforms.
Mike Farrar, an American military contractor who helps train Afghan Scouts, said the program has proved invaluable.
BUL, Afghanistan -- Mohammad Aziz Ayob adjusts his Boy Scout neckerchief, leans over and plants a sapling into the dry Kabul soil.
Mohammad Tamim Hamkar, Afghan Scouting\'s program manager, said that "it\'s hard to let the girls do everything."
Still, it is difficult to train and look after local staff.
"If things get ugly, anything with an international connection could be targeted," said Marnie Gustavson.
BUL, Afghanistan -- Mohammad Aziz Ayob is planting a tree.
"I love my uniform; it makes me feel proud," said Ayob.
It hopes to have 1,500 Scouts signed up by the end of 2013.
Camping and hiking are restricted to boys.
Extremists in Afghanistan see any involvement with foreign countries as treason.
This could mean danger for Afghan scouts if there is further trouble in the country.
In 2014, soldiers from the U.S. and its allies will withdraw from Afghanistan.

Sweet Briar and Deep Springs colleges are single-gender schools.
The people who run Sweet Briar said in February that the school would close this summer.
They said that even letting male students go to the school would not help.
Many later go to top colleges for four-year degrees.
They can give special attention to those male students, the officials said.
One of these doors could possibly lead to a storeroom, Reeves said.
The theory would take many more tests to confirm, although a radar scan could quickly reveal any hollows.

It had remained safe from the tomb robbers who ravaged items found in other chambers because of how well it was hidden.
Tutankhamun is believed to have ruled for only nine years, after taking power as a young boy.
Thanks to rounds of royal inbreeding, he had a club foot and could walk only with a cane.
There are rumors of a "Pharaoh\'s Curse," which brings bad luck to those who disturb the tombs.
Eady, better known as Omm Sety, openly believed that she had been an ancient Egyptian priestess in a past life.
"It\'s in the Valley of the Kings, and it\'s quite near to the Tutankhamun tomb," she said, according to a biography.
"But it\'s in a place where nobody would ever think of looking for it."

"If I\'m wrong, I\'m wrong," Nicholas said.
The ancient Egyptian Queen Nefertiti has long been at the center of a mystery.
Now, however, an archaeologist named Nicholas Reeves claims he has found her secret tomb.
It consists of four rooms, but it is much smaller than those of other pharaohs.
It had remained safe from tomb robbers because of how well it was hidden.
The queen, famed for her beauty, served as co-ruler with King Akhenaten, her husband.

When Ethan Brown peels apart his ready-to-eat vegetarian chicken strips, the stringy strands mimic the moist meat of the real thing.
That\'s absolutely everything," said Brown, founder of Beyond Meat, admiring the strands of faux chicken at a cafe near the company\'s Southern California headquarters.
The company gets close to creating that authentic texture by blasting soy and pea proteins through an alternating cascade of high heat and high pressure.
"They said their competitors are the people who make chicken."
Beyond Meat and other makers of such substitutes are chasing increasingly picky taste buds by cooking up grub that captures more of the bite and appearance of animal flesh.
Janet Corvin, 52, has been a vegetarian since she was a child, but still desires the taste and texture of meat.
He added, "Yet we can\'t ask everyone to become vegetarians.
A Gallup poll last year placed the percentage of vegetarians in the U.S. at 5 percent.
"It\'s hard for me to imagine that tofu or tempeh will compete with T-bones any time soon among people who enjoy the beefy taste and texture of a steak," said Janet Riley, a spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute.
The team developed a method that broke down soy proteins by alternating high temperatures with high pressure.
Pressed through a large, stainless steel machine, the proteins ooze out like pale Play-Doh.

"It\'s like taking a fun toy apart to see how it works, and then putting it back together," said Matt Kuchta, a UW-Stout professor of biology and geologist who teaches the soil science and conservation class.
The class started with a clean slate and watched how plants extract water from the soil; how microorganisms interact with organic and mineral components of soil; and what kinds of minerals are present and provide important nutrients for plant life.

The U.S. and Chinese presidents announced they had come to an agreement on a joint effort to fight climate change on Wednesday.
At a news conference in the Chinese capital, President Barack Obama said he had agreed that the U.S. would cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent by 2025.
It sets a bolder timeline for two countries that, together, account for more than a third of global greenhouse gas emissions.
The reductions are the kind scientists have recommended to avert the greatest temperature rises associated with climate change.
At a U.N. summit in September to kick off the drafting of an international climate change accord, Obama spoke bluntly of American responsibility for global warming.
China, Zhang said, would put forth a plan in early 2015 to put a cap on its greenhouse gases "as soon as possible" and scale back emissions thereafter.
The U.S. and Chinese presidents announced a new joint effort to fight climate change on Wednesday.

Israeli children returned to school Monday in a welcome sign that life was returning back to normal after the Gaza war.
His mother, Enav Neardea, said her children mostly took the rockets and sirens in stride, even when they were out at the playground or swimming pool.
Environment Minister Amir Peretz, who voted against the cut, said it would hit poorer Israelis "directly in the pocket."
Peretz said the government should "have enough courage to impose a temporary tax" on everyone.

The appearance of the deadly Ebola virus in the United States has scared voters and raised questions about whether the White House can handle several crises at once.
McConnell said, "I don\'t expect the president to wake up tomorrow morning and view the world any differently."
He added, "He knows I won\'t, either."
"There would have to be some really exceptional set of events to get people who have shown no interest in cooperating to get something done," said Ken Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who studies the presidency.
Obama spent the last two days leading up to Election Day in meetings at the White House.
"I think there is a fork in the road."
McConnell added, "I don\'t expect the president to wake up tomorrow morning and view the world any differently.

The United States was capitalist, focusing on free markets and trade.
In many ways, life is better today for Germans who live in former East Germany.
Today, Ossies, as former East German residents are called, suffer from higher unemployment, are paid less, have far less in savings, and receive less money in retirement than Germans in the former West.
Employees at a shopping mall in eastern Berlin make $1,400 less each year than workers at a mall across the street in western Berlin.
In Kleinmachnow, the problem arose because of a basic difference between capitalism and communism \u2014 the idea of personal property.
As communism took over East Germany in the 1950s, many people moved to West Germany.

Collector and art dealer Peggy Guggenheim commissioned the work in the summer of 1943 for the entry hall of her Manhattan townhouse.
She was planning a November Pollock show for her gallery, and the painting would be a statement of her faith in a barely known talent.
"As soon as the paint was dry to the touch, Jackson broke down the stretcher, rolled the canvas, and transported both to Peggy\'s apartment building," Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith wrote in "Jackson Pollock: An American Saga," their Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning 1990 biography.
Pollock did lay out an initial overall composition, painting wet-on-wet in diluted, high-quality oils of teal, lemon yellow, red and umber.
Building an image of manly vigor surely had something to do with it.
Which begs a question: Does the destruction of a central element of the New York School\'s creation myth lessen "Mural\'s" artistic importance \u2014 or Pollock\'s?
Over days (or weeks), he honed his own steadily maturing vision.
By 9 a.m. the next morning, 15 intense hours later, "Mural" was done.
And the separate layers each required drying time, some for many days.
Myths die hard.
In 1943 Pollock, then 31 years old, was an artist living in Greenwich Village in the midst of World War II.
The carefully constructed painting shows us that Pollock knew exactly what he was aiming for.
For a time, it put New York at the center of the art world.
It also emphasized spontaneous creation \u2014 creating in the moment, without planning \u2014 and the act of painting itself.
The painting in question is Jackson Pollock\'s mammoth 1943 "Mural."
Still, the artist compared them to a stampede of mustang horses.
We now know that he painted over many days and perhaps even several weeks.
The huge painting would serve as a statement of her faith in Pollock.

The man seemed to be in good health when he stepped off an airplane Sept. 20 but began to feel sick four days later, said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Medical teams are now scrambling to locate people who were in close contact with the patient and may have been infected.
Johnson said that people in the crowded room watched the news closely and remained calm.
When she learned why they were there, she stopped short of the doors and wrung her hands as she decided whether to go in.
Frieden did say the patient had been in contact with only a handful of people after he became contagious.
A special team of CDC "disease detectives" and other experts have been dispatched to Texas to assist Dallas County health workers in tracing the patient\'s contacts.
If they show signs of a fever, they will be isolated and tested for Ebola, officials said.
"There are no other suspected cases in the state of Texas at this time," said Dr. David Lakey.
Access to good health care makes a widespread outbreak here highly unlikely.
"We have the ability to trace contacts, monitor people and to act quickly if any of them should start to exhibit symptoms," said Dr. Anne Rimoin, a doctor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.
Gaye would like officials to release the names of Ebola patients so that others in the community could take precautions.
"We see what is happening right now in Africa.
Frieden emphasized that the man could not spread the disease until he began to develop active symptoms of the fever.

Officials would not say which flights the patient took to get to Texas.
Liberia is one of the three African nations now battling the worst Ebola outbreak in history.
However, Frieden said other passengers on the airplane would not have been at risk since the patient had no symptoms at the time of the flight.

SHINGTON \u2013 President Barack Obama plans to move faster to bring high-speed Internet to American public schools.
Obama made the remarks as he revealed plans to speed up the start of his pet project.
Several U.S. companies are pitching in about $750 million in goods and services to help students get connected to the World Wide Web.
Back then, White House officials expected that the FCC would have to go through a long rule-making process to get access to $2 billion.
Right now, that money is already dedicated to building capacity for high-speed Internet.
The challenge showed Obama using his new second-term plan.

SHINGTON \u2013 President Barack Obama wants to bring fast Internet to American public schools.
For about 20 million students, the money will mean they can get the Internet in their schools and libraries.
It is sooner than Obama thought it would be when he launched his "ConnectED" plan last year.
Back then, White House officials thought the FCC would have to go through a long process to be allowed to spend $2 billion.
But the FCC recently decided it could give the money out faster.
This will speed up the funding of high-speed Internet projects without having to vote on them.
But he also warned lawmakers that he was about to ask them to pitch in.

Astronauts are not the only life forms on the International Space Station.
More work needs to be done to see exactly how many of these disease-causing microbes are aboard the space station, and if they are virulent, meaning if they are making toxins.
The study provides a baseline view of the microbes on the space station, but there is still more work to be done.
A new study of the life forms, or organisms, living on the space station found that there are more types of life living there than there are in the carefully controlled rooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Earth.
The results of the study were published in the journal Microbiome.
However, that method has some flaws.

The fans have reacted by filling stadiums or fan fests and embracing the carefree culture: A group of middle-aged German men in super-tight swimsuits and with bellies bulging, played football on Copacabana Monday morning before heading for the big-screen TV.
The home favorite came back from 1-0 down to beat Croatia 3-1.
"It\'s a big party," Netherlands supporter Rolleman said.
The games have been packed full of goals and great moments.
"It\'s crazy that I\'ve been able to do this," said Simon of New York City, describing her idea to study the rare form of cancer.
It was amazing enough that the teenager survived a rare type of cancer that attacked her liver.
Age 18 is pretty young to be listed as one of the writers of a study.
Experts at the New York Genome Center, which studies genes, assisted the study.
A second person who survived the cancer also co-wrote the study.
In it, Elana Simon and another patient who survived the illness explain why teen patients should get involved in the tests.

The crash left officials and families across Europe in a state of shock.
Sobbing, grieving relatives at airports in both cities were led away by airport workers and crisis counselors.
Photos of the crash site from a French newspaper showed scattered black flecks across a mountain and several larger airplane body sections with windows.
"No one can access the site from the ground," said Gilbert Sauvan, a lawmaker and president of the general council, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence.
Officials believe that 67 German nationals were on board, including 16 high school students on an exchange program from the German town of Haltern.
It was short noise and lasted just a few seconds," said Sandrine Boisse, the president of the Pra Loup tourism office.
Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told French television that he expected "an extremely long and extremely difficult" search-and-rescue operation because of how difficult it will be to get to the crash site.
The weather in the area worsened Tuesday afternoon, with a chilly rain falling.
"We cannot say at the moment why our colleague went into the descent, and so quickly and without previously consulting air traffic control," Stefan-Kenan Scheib said.
The plane last underwent a routine check in Germany on Monday, and its last regular full check took place in the summer of 2013.
Pierre Polizzi, the owner of a campground near the crash site, said he heard the plane making strange noises shortly before it crashed.
"The noise I heard was long, like eight seconds, as if the plane was going more slowly than a military plane.

To understand earthquakes, scientists are going straight to their source.
"If we want to understand earthquakes, it\'s one of the few kind of direct ways we can get evidence about what faults are like," said Clifford Thurber.
Thurber and Tobin are part of an international group of scientists working on the Deep Fault Drilling Project.
Scientists therefore think the fault is due for an earthquake, estimating a 28 percent chance of a quake in the next 50 years.
He spent seven weeks at sea last winter on a scientific drilling ship called the Chikyu, drilling into the Nankai Fault off the coast of southern Japan.
The UW researchers also were involved in an earlier experiment, the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD).
The experiment recovered some of the first samples of rock at the depth where small earthquakes can originate.
The lessons scientists learned there will be applied to the experiments in New Zealand and Japan.
So we need to know as well as we can how they work and whether there are ways to (reduce) their effects by early warning or detection," said Harold Tobin.
Thurber and Tobin are part of a group of international scientists working on the Deep Fault Drilling Project.
The UW researchers also were involved in an earlier experiment, called the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD).
Scientists drilled a 2-mile-deep hole through the famous San Andreas Fault in California.
Scientists are drilling deep into the Earth to understand earthquakes.
These rocks are like the ones down deep, Thurber said.
Earthquakes can hurt more people than hurricanes and tornadoes.
These are faults that could erupt at any moment, causing giant earthquakes.
So we need to know as well as we can how they work and whether there are ways to (reduce) their effects by early warning or detection," said Harold Tobin.
This is not very helpful for people living in the area who have only moments to take cover.
Earthquakes begin deep below the surface of the Earth, too deep for researchers to go.
Then they will place instruments in the hole to measure seismic tremors and other factors.

David Bolen recalled his wolf encounter from last fall as he ate breakfast at the Breakwater Family Restaurant in town.
Ironwood resident Al Clemens said the wolves have killed off the local deer population, affecting the popular \u2014 and economically important \u2014 local deer hunt.
The pair were told to name all of the plants and creatures and places of the Earth.
He wishes he still had that communication and partnership with (the tribes)," said Roger LaBine, chairman of the conservation committee of the Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians.
"The reason they became able to thrive were the protections they were given," said Nancy Warren, the Great Lakes regional director for the National Wolfwatcher Coalition, a nonprofit dedicated to wolf conservation.
When their task was finished, Gzhemnidoo told them to travel separate paths, but said that they would remain linked.
When wolves were nearly wiped out and hunted for their fur by white settlers, the tribes lost much of their land to the same settlers, LaBine said.
Michigan  lost almost all of their wolves by the end of the 1950s.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20131121_WARTHOG.jpg" />LOS ANGELES \u2014 The A-10 Thunderbolt II, a ground-attack plane nicknamed the Warthog, could be the latest aircraft to be killed off as the Pentagon slashes its budget.
The Air Force \u2014 better known for aerial dogfights and dropping GPS-guided bombs \u2014 would rather invest its money elsewhere.
The Pentagon has yet to release its latest budget or officially say that the Warthogs are on a kill list.
But last month, the Air Force said that eliminating the fleet of 326 aircraft would save it about $3.5 billion over five years.
The military says it must slash its older arsenal to save money.
But because these programs support troops and provide thousands of jobs across many states, Congress has always come to their rescue.
Sequestration cuts would reduce Pentagon spending by $52 billion next year.
The A-10 was designed in the 1970s around the gun \u2014 the heaviest rotating cannon ever mounted on an aircraft.
The aircraft has been upgraded over the years.
Known as the Joint Strike Fighter, the nearly $400 billion program would pay for 2,400 jets that could be used by the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.
The F-35 provides 127,000 jobs in 47 states and Puerto Rico.
!
But major savings \u2014 such as in the billions of dollars \u2014 can be made only by cutting an entire fleet, the Air Force has said.
The plane is designed to keep flying even if parts of the wing or one of its engines has been blown to shreds.
The aircraft has been upgraded often over the years.
If spending is going to be cut severely, where are the cuts going to come from: expensive new weapons that can carry out more missions, or older, simpler weapons?
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20131121_WARTHOG.jpg" />LOS ANGELES \u2014 The A-10 Thunderbolt II is a plane nicknamed the Warthog.

The A-10 has a reputation for tearing apart tanks, and clearing the way for troops on the ground with its massive rounds of ammunition.
It is in charge of military spending and the Air Force, Army, Navy and Marines.
The military says it must slash its older weapons to save money.
But these programs support troops and provide thousands of jobs across many states.
Pilots do that by firing on enemy tanks, other vehicles and strongholds with its high-powered Gatling gun.
But it must fly low and slow over the battlefield.

After dropping for many years, piano sales are coming back.
Many families know the value and benefits of music, so the piano will survive and thrive, he said.
Sales went up as the economy improved last year, after falling three years in a row.
Piano sales are not dying, just changing, said Dennis Saphir.
Websites like Craigslist and eBay have made buying used pianos cheap and easy.
Zoells opened his shop, PianoForte, and began selling expensive pianos in 2004.
At first, the police shooting triggered a public outcry.
Others, however, say that there are possible benefits, as seen in the Rialto case.
In Salt Lake City, for instance, an officer shot and killed a 20-year-old man on Aug. 11, two days after Brown was slain in Ferguson.
On his first day as a commissioner last year, he said the cameras were important and vowed to raise funds to buy them.
"We\'re just waiting for the prosecutor to finish his investigation and then we\'ll release (the footage) as a public document," Police Chief Chris Burbank said this week.
In Rialto, the number of police use-of-force events dropped 66 percent the first year cameras were worn.
The money went not only to purchase the devices \u2014 each cost about $1,200 \u2014 but also to run a website to store the images.
When police shot and wounded a man in Rialto, California, in 2011, people got angry at first.
Anger grew after cellphone video taken from a nearby balcony suggested that police had overreacted.
Most likely, their use will grow as the anger over Ferguson continues.
The Los Angeles Police Department is testing cameras.
This week, New York announced plans to do so as well.
By the end of next month, about 440 officers will be equipped with them.
Around the country, he said, about a dozen cities use cameras.
The money went not only to purchase the cameras \u2014 each cost about $1,200 \u2014 it also went to run a website to store the footage.
"We have had a big success," he said.
In 2011, police in Rialto, California, shot and wounded a man.
"These cameras are capturing good work by law enforcement.
De Anda said the city spent $100,000 on the cameras over the two years.
In the Ferguson case, it is still not clear why Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown.
In Rialto, 120 officers were equipped with cameras in early 2012.
The money went not only to purchase the cameras \u2014 each cost about $1,200 \u2014 it also went to run a website to store the footage.
The officer was wearing a body camera.
In 2011, police in Rialto, California, shot and wounded a man.
It looked as if there might be big protests, like those seen recently in Ferguson, Missouri.
The video, he said, showed the facts.
The Los Angeles Police Department is testing them out.
Take a case that happened last month in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Across the country, he said, about a dozen cities use cameras.
The goal is to purchase 500 cameras.
Since then, claims of police misconduct have dropped dramatically.

Garcetti, like the past mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, speaks a version of the language that might be called Funky American Business Spanish for lack of a more scientific term.
Villaraigosa and Garcetti have Latino roots, but both had to learn much of their Spanish in school or on the job.
They speak a serviceable but far from perfect Spanish, a shortcoming each has acknowledged with good humor.
On Tuesday, Garcetti referred to his language skills as "good community meeting Spanish."
If Garcetti had been speaking French on a diplomatic mission to Paris, he might have been yelled at for his errors, some say jokingly.
His parents, like many Latino parents at the time, saw the widespread prejudice against Spanish speakers.

A recently released study from the University of Texas warned that the Central Valley aquifer, the large storage of underground water farmers use for irrigation, is being used up at an unsustainable rate \u2014 even when wet years follow dry ones.
"Annie and Jeff\'s apricots are worth any price," Cultrera said.
One farmer who still dry-farms today is Fritz Durst, who owns Tule Farm in Yolo County, California, where he grows garbanzo beans, wheat, safflower and other crops.
The method is as simple as it is risky.
Used for centuries in the Mediterranean region to grow crops like olives and grapes, the practice is not for the faint of heart.
"Dry farming would be a hard life because you\'re at the whim of the rains," said Jay Lund, a scientist at the University of California-Davis.
Many are small farmers and winemakers who either lack a good water supply or believe that dry farming produces better-tasting fruits and vegetables.
"I think people are interested in the idea," said David Runsten of the Community Alliance with Family Farmers.
Runsten recently promoted dry farming to a group of California farmers.
Nearly half a million acres of land is devoted to wine grapes in California.
Of those, about 2,000 acres are dry-farmed; the rest are drip-irrigated, Runsten said.
He said he saw the superiority of dry-farmed fruit when he dry-farmed a 100-year-old heirloom apricot orchard between 2003 and 2010.
The store expects to sell potatoes and tomatoes that come from farms using the dry-farm method, said Kerri Williams, produce manager at the store.
The store sold the tomatoes last year and will offer them again in late summer.
Typically, dry-farmed fruit grows much smaller than fruit from irrigated farms.
"You still find that people buy with their eyes," he said "unless you can get the message to them with marketing, before they get to the point of purchase."
"There is no irrigation here, only rainwater in this area," said Durst.
"What we\'ve done is we\'ve adapted to the rainfall," he said.
Nearly half a million acres of land are devoted to wine grapes in California.
"The dry-farmed stuff has a whole different flavor," said Maine, who co-owns the farm Good Humus Produce, with his wife, Annie.
"There is no irrigation here, only rainwater in this area," Durst said.
That moisture, however small, keeps his crops alive in the dry season.

The farmer walked slowly up the hill toward her barn, as her driver followed behind her in a minivan.
The soldiers had taken back control of the tower from gunmen two days before.
Now, as the separatists in her area of Slovyansk are surrounded by Ukrainian security forces, her whole farm is at risk of collapse.
Vitaly Kolesnik, the supply chief for the Slovyansk electrical district, asked himself a similar question as he drove back down the hill at full speed.
The tower appeared to have been damaged during the fighting two days earlier, cutting off power supplies to at least three suburbs.
"I explained to them my mission and the plight of the residents sitting without electricity in such hot weather, but they wouldn\'t listen!"
Fighting in Slovyansk killed more than a dozen people and injured scores more in recent days.
But outside Slovyansk, troops from the Ukrainian government, army and national guard were tightening a noose around the town, manning checkpoints on every road going in and out of the city, searching vehicles and demanding to see the papers of every driver and passenger.
The blockade will continue to prevent the rebels from sneaking out of Slovyansk or getting reinforcements and weapons supplies, a Ukrainian troop commander said.

Jake Betts tugged the reins of a horse named Leroy and rode up a ridge.
Betts and 10 others who saddled up began this roundup at the first break of light.
Holton Nelson, 15, has been helping drive cattle since he was 4 years old.
They wear long sleeves even in the heat, pointed boots rather than sneakers or work shoes, and their jeans are always blue.
They work in areas so remote that few human eyes ever view them.
Jade Cole, 16, rose at 3:30 a.m. to meet her uncle Cliff Cole, who manages the ranch.
Other cowboys arrived for the roundup, their pickups hauling trailers carrying horses.
Each cowboy has his own command to get the wandering cattle to join the parade, and all of the cattle obey.
"Ryan\'s a yelper," Betts says.
More than 70 cows go up the truck ramp and pound into the trailer.
The truckers will drive the cows 50 miles to a feedlot, then head back for more.
"I\'m 51 and been doing this since I was 18," Ernest says.
"We don\'t like to go to town more than we have to," said Cliff Cole.

When the PDAs beeped, students were asked to complete a questionnaire about what they were doing and how they felt about it.
By gathering information about real-life situations, Goetz\'s team hoped to confirm psychological outlines of four distinct types of boredom: \u2014 Indifferent boredom, a relaxing and slightly positive type of boredom that reflects "a general indifference to, and withdrawal from, the external world"; \u2014 Calibrating boredom, the slightly unpleasant state of having wandering thoughts and "a general openness to behaviors aimed at changing the situation"; \u2014 Searching boredom, the kind that makes you feel restless and leaves you "actively seeking out specific ways of minimizing feelings of boredom"; and \u2014 Reactant boredom, which is so bad that it prompts sufferers "to leave the boredom-inducing situation and avoid those responsible for this situation (for example, teachers)."
If they felt bored, they were asked to rate their feelings of boredom, using a five-point scale that ranged from "calm" to "fidgety."
What researchers found is that the life of a German student can be very boring indeed.
This difference can perhaps be explained by the fact that college students have more freedom to walk away from a boring situation.
Apathetic boredom accounted for 10 percent of all boredom among the college students, and 36 percent of all boredom among the high-schoolers.
Students found apathetic boredom even more unpleasant than reactant boredom, but they were far less likely to do anything about it.
No one likes being bored.

Heading north from Leeds, the speed limit shifts from 75 to 80 miles per hour (mph) \u2014 all the way to Provo, 250 miles away.
But many safety officials are scratching their heads over a trend they say will lead to more \u2014 and more gruesome \u2014 deaths on the roads.
This year, Idaho and Wyoming raised their top speeds to 80 on some stretches of interstate.
"When your neighbor increases its speed to 80, there\'s pressure to do the same," said Kara Macek, spokeswoman for the Governors Highway Safety Association in Washington, D.C. "Motorists are giving in to the need to get everywhere quickly \u2014 especially out West, where it takes forever to get places."
Utah officials say that highway crashes have dropped on parts of rural Interstate 15 where they raised the speed limit to 80.
"About 10,000 Americans die every year in crashes that are related to speed, from going faster than the posted limit or faster than conditions allow," Rader said.
"The 80 mph speed limit is symbolic of my individuality and freedom," editorial page editor Robert Ehlert wrote in the Idaho Statesman.
"You get there faster; you unload faster."
"Our guys are out there on the road every day," said Sean McNally, a spokesman for the Association.
"Higher speed limits get people to their destinations faster, but there\'s always a cost: Ultimately, there will be more severe crashes and more deaths on those roads."
"It does make a difference \u2014 I can get ahead of schedule," said 26-year-old Hansen, who was hauling a load of steel beams for an apartment building in Salt Lake City.

Utah officials say that highway crashes have decreased on parts of Interstate 15 where they raised the speed limit to 80 mph.
A 2009 study showed that more drivers were following the new limit.

She began teaching the class in 1990 shortly after the school opened.
Students spend three years in her classroom, allowing her to get to know them more personally.
A teacher not using grades may rely on observation and detailed records about students instead.
Fischetti said research shows students in ungraded classes are not worse off, but teachers have to be well-prepared.
Her students enter the class at or above grade level and finish second grade able to read fourth-grade-level books, she said.
Barrett will be retiring this year after 36 years of teaching, but another teacher at the school will be taking over.
They finish second grade capable of reading fourth-grade-level books, she said.

She still teaches the educational standards, which are required by the state.

"For the first time in history, states recommended by consensus that an international treaty be negotiated to address the urgent crisis of biodiversity loss on the high seas," says Daniela Diz.
Although not utterly lawless, the high seas is controlled by a jumble of institutions and regulations.
"The new agreement will be about what we keep in the seas, instead of what we extract," says Karen Sack, director of The Pew Charitable Trusts\' International Marine Program.
To prevent overfishing the agreement would, among other things, make it much easier to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the high seas.
And yet, the evidence in favor of closing the high seas to fishing is growing.
"I realize what we have lost," says Enric Sala, a National Geographic Society explorer-in-residence and co-author of the UBC paper.
"It\'s the difference between the places that are degraded, and places that are pristine and beautiful that gives us hope."
To prevent overfishing, the agreement would, among other things, make it much easier to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the high seas.

More than 20,000 U.S. farms employ more than 435,000 immigrant workers legally every year, according to 2012 U.S. Department of Agriculture data.
"Because we\'re not a border state, it\'s definitely harder to get people over this far from the border to work," said Chalmers Carr.
"In northern Ohio, we\'re on the front lines, and it\'s not because we\'re on the northern border," said Mark Gilson.
"You\'ve got a choice to import your food or you can import your labor to harvest your food."
"These aren\'t just people with their heads down in the field for us," he said.
"There\'s truly not enough farmworkers now, legal or illegal," said Chalmers Carr.
Farmers say the crops cannot wait.
But we\'re also not getting anybody replacing them because of the mess we have at the border and no immigration law," said Manuel Cunha Jr.
From 2010 to 2012, Carr said he advertised for 2,000 workers.
"We respect their hard work."
Some people say U.S. workers should fill those jobs.
The second team found that many other species have only one copy per cell, just like humans.
Schiffman and his team looked at how elephant cells reacted to radiation, compared with cells from 10 healthy humans and 10 patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
Still, progress in the fight against cancer can come "from unexpected directions," said Dr. Ted Gansler of the American Cancer Society.
The elephant cells self-destructed at twice the rate of healthy human cells and more than five times the rate of cells from patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
Studies on humans are at least several years away, but "we certainly think we\'ve found something very intriguing," Schiffman said.

On a summer day in 1885, three Hawaiian princes surfed at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River in Santa Cruz, California.
"It definitely worries me," said big-wave rider Jake Wormhoudt, who has already noticed changes in water temperature and weather patterns during the 35 years he has surfed in Santa Cruz.
By 2100, these storms could shift, sending the swells parallel to the coast instead of toward it.
"As we increase sea level \u2026 those same size waves won\'t break over those nice bedrock ridges in the same spots that they used to," said Curt Storlazzi, a geologist and oceanographer, with the USGS office in Santa Cruz.
Some communities around Monterey Bay have built barriers to protect homes and infrastructure from rising seas.
These barriers may also contribute to beach erosion and cut off access to surfing spots.
That could improve surf conditions around Monterey Bay, at least temporarily.
Still, the shifting climate and rising seas could create better surfing conditions along other stretches of the California coastline \u2014 there are too many variables to pinpoint where.
This mixed and uncertain future may leave some surfers grasping for hard answers.
In 1885, three young Hawaiian princes brought surfing to North America.
"It definitely worries me," said big-wave rider Jake Wormhoudt, who has already noticed changes in water temperature and weather during the 35 years he has surfed in Santa Cruz.
But, she explained, storms on land may not lead to higher waves along the coast.

"It definitely worries me," said big-wave rider Jake Wormhoudt, who has already noticed changes in water temperature and weather during the 35 years he has surfed in Santa Cruz.
Recently, researchers used the models to study how a warming world might affect waves, said Li Erikson, a coastal engineer with the U.S. Geological Survey in Santa Cruz.
"We\'ll roll with it," said Pete Ogilvie, a Monterey Bay surfer for more than 30 years.
He is facing the possible changes with a laid-back Surf City vibe.
Higher sea levels will change how waves break against the coast.
"If there\'s a 3-foot tide, everyone\'s out here," he said recently as he headed out to Steamer Lane.
If the predictions are true, Monterey Bay could end the 21st century with poor surfing waves.

Mother Teresa, the tiny, stooped nun who cared for the poorest of the poor, will be declared a saint next year.
"With her work, she was always the symbol of mercy, not just with words but with her actions," said the Reverend Sebastian Vazhakala.
By Dec. 9, 2008, he was in a coma and dying, suffering from fluid around the brain.
The surgery did not take place, and a day later the man was declared to be symptom-free.
We are very happy," said Sunita Kumar, a spokeswoman for the Missionaries of Charity in the eastern city of Kolkata, which was earlier called Calcutta and where Mother Teresa lived and worked.
It has since opened more than 130 houses worldwide to provide comfort and care for the needy, sick and "poorest of the poor."
It ran roughly 600 orphanages, soup kitchens, homeless shelters and clinics around the world.
During his September 2014 visit to Albania, Francis confided to his interpreter that he was not only impressed by her fortitude, but in some ways he feared it.

Prince William Sound today looks spectacular, a stunning landscape of mountainous fjords \u2014 cliffs framed by blue-green waters, and thickly forested islands.
"I think the big surprise for all of us who have worked on this thing for the last 25 years has been the continued presence of relatively fresh oil," said Gary Shigenaka.
Listed as still not recovering are the herring, a group of killer whales and a type of North Pacific seabird.
But, the checks were too late and too little, he said.
I got divorced," said Wills, who now runs a bookshop and cafe in Homer, Alaska.
Prince William Sound was home to a booming spring herring fishery.
Researchers found physical changes in herring exposed to the oil.
"No other (fish) stock in Alaska crashed in 1993, so that\'s indirect evidence it is spill-related," said Jeep Rice.
The herring never really recovered, and the current population is too low to fight off predators.
"The evidence is pretty compelling that it was a spill-related effect on those two groups of killer whales," said federal marine scientist Shigenaka.
If it does, it would be the end of a genetic line that researchers say has hunted in the area for thousands of years, maybe since the last ice age.
The sound has "had a very solid, complete recovery," said Richard Keil, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil.
He said the spill left a huge mark on those who made a living from Prince William Sound.
Then, four years after the spill, the herring population crashed.
The killer whales of the sound also have suffered.
A newspaper photo showed a group of whales swimming near the tanker as it gushed oil.
Populations dropped in the year after the spill.
But, it was too late and too little, he said.
Court cases will decide whether to seek more money from Exxon Mobil for cleaning up remaining oil.

Researchers several years ago tested the widely accepted notion that skipping breakfast can make you fat.
Indeed, it is written in the U.S. Dietary Guidelines, the federal government\'s advice book, which recommends having breakfast every day because "not eating breakfast has been associated with excess body weight."
And the only group to lose weight was the group that skipped breakfast.
"In overweight individuals, skipping breakfast daily for 4 weeks leads to a reduction in body weight," the Columbia University researchers in New York concluded.
A closer look at the way government nutritionists adopted the breakfast warning shows how guesses \u2014 possibly right, possibly wrong \u2014 can become hard-and-fast rules.
In analyzing the results of observational studies, scientists try to adjust for the potential confounding factors that they can measure \u2014 age, alcohol consumption, exercise, employment, and the like.
Young said during a talk at the Sigma Xi, the science research society.
That experiment, conducted on children in Mexico, "found no relationship with breakfast alone" and weight gain, according to the committee.
Several years ago, researchers tested the idea that skipping breakfast can make you fat.
At 8:30 in the morning for four weeks, one group got oatmeal, another got frosted corn flakes and a third got nothing.

One of the key pieces of evidence, for example, examined the records for 20,000 men who work in health care.
Breakfast skippers in the health care worker study, for example, tended to drink more, smoke more, and exercise less.
The breakfast recommendation became part of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines, under its advice for losing weight.

The correct answer is "B," according to a new study of 66 of the nation\'s big-city school districts by the Council of the Great City Schools.
The president said federal officials would work with states, schools and teachers to "make sure that we\'re not obsessing about testing."
About 12 million students in 29 states and the District of Columbia took the tests.
Also, 4 in 10 districts reported having to wait two months to four months before getting test results.
The lack of timely results meant that teachers began the new school year without knowing whether a student was having a problem.

"The Army goes to such an expense to make rations, then watches time and time again as soldiers throw out anything that doesn\'t look and taste good," said Mary Ann Lila, director of N.C. State\'s Plants for Human Health Institute.
To make their products, the researchers have found a way to extract the fruit and vegetable phytochemicals and bind them with flour made from soybeans or hemp.
Meanwhile, researchers at the Plants for Human Health Institute are experimenting with various foods that could be made with the healthier flour.
Athletes, hikers and people trying to control their weight could also benefit.
These and other vegetables and fruits have phytochemicals.
Soldiers in harsh climates such as Iraq or Africa have few options.

Kap will display and sell examples of her work this weekend at Elegant Egg &amp; More, an annual show and sale of eggshell art.
That\'s because the term pysanky comes from the verb pysaty, meaning "to write," and because the wax is applied with a writing stylus called a kistka.
She even injects some of the solution into the emptied eggs with a syringe to clean them and prevent odor.
The egg then goes into the first in a series of dye baths, progressing from the lightest color to the darkest.

The endurance of the art form amazes Kap.
That\'s because the term pysanky comes from the verb pysaty, meaning "to write," and because the wax is applied with a sort of pen called a kistka.
Geometric shapes and simple pictures have particular meanings: A triangle, for example, stands for the Holy Trinity, while a rooster symbolizes fertility.
After the final dye bath, she melts off the wax with a candle flame to expose the multicolored design underneath.
She learned the art of pysanky from her mother when she was growing up in Cleveland.
"So somebody had to have done them in secret for years and years," Kap said.
Kap turns her dining room over to pysanky-making for two or three months each year.
Kap will display examples of her work this weekend at Elegant Egg &amp; More, an annual show of eggshell art.
The eggs are dyed in several stages, and wax is applied to prevent coloring in certain parts of the eggshell.
That\'s because the term pysanky comes from the verb pysaty, meaning "to write," and because the wax is applied with a sort of pen called a kistka.
She washes the eggs beforehand in water and vinegar so the dyes will take, she said.
She spends seven or eight hours a day on her art, she said.
The shapes and colors on pysanky eggs have special meanings.
While the rest of the nation is stuffing itself on Thanksgiving, the immigration activist and two other fasters will be in a heated tent on the National Mall at the foot of the Capitol.

But no presidential library has been built in a low-income, inner-city neighborhood.
Developer Dan McCaffery wants the library among his developments in southeastern Chicago.
Rutherford was part of a group who visited each site, looking at access, parking, cost of preparing the land, and the distance of nearby hotels, restaurants and other tourist attractions.
Location is important because presidential libraries have only a limited ability to attract large numbers of people on their own according to Marshall Brown, a professor of architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
They are hoping that President Barack Obama will choose to build his presidential library in their area.
The Clinton library in Little Rock, Ark., led to more than $2 billion in development along the downtown riverfront.
The site of the library will be announced in early 2015.
"They wouldn\'t have to wait on school trips, with a presidential library just down the street from where they live," she said.

Currie, 51, first became fascinated with crossbreeding plants when he was a boy in Michigan.
He read library books about plants and read horticulture magazines ordered by his mother, a master gardener.
It took Currie 12 years of crossbreeding to reach the peak of the pepper world.
The peppers are curvy and alluring: orange, red and green spheres glowing in the late autumn sunshine.
Currie is an independent person who insists on doing things his own way, and it took him more than two years to fill out the Guinness paperwork.
The human body responds to the chemical "heat" from the Reaper as if it were burned with a match, he added.
The hottest pepper \u2014 its name is top secret \u2014 "tastes awful," Currie said.
Forty minutes after chewing one, he was still drinking water, he said.
He began crossbreeding peppers after reading scientific papers suggesting that they might reduce the risk of heart attacks and cancer, two diseases that run in his family, Currie said.
He made salsas and hot sauces at home from peppers he grew in his yard.
The peppers helped him woo his wife, who loves salsa.
Two years ago, he opened a store  on Main Street in downtown Fort Mill.
It took Currie 12 years of crossbreeding to reach the top of the pepper world.
It was based on years of testing by chemists at Winthrop University in South Carolina.
In fact, he said, even the Reaper fumes and residue on his lab gloves were too hot for him.

She convinced him to sell his salsas rather than giving them away to friends and neighbors.
It took Currie 12 years of crossbreeding to reach the top of the pepper world.
He said he tested hundreds of hybrid combinations before finally finding the perfect one.
In the end, he combined a "really nastily hot" La Soufriere pepper from the Caribbean island of St. Vincent and a Naga pepper from Pakistan to create Smokin Ed\'s Carolina Reaper.
In his fourth year of breeding the Reaper \u2014 it takes years for hybrids to reproduce and stabilize \u2014 Currie asked a friend to taste the new pepper.
It was based on years of testing by chemists at Winthrop University in South Carolina.
Their official rating of the Reaper \u2014 1.56 million SHUs \u2014 was accepted by Guinness.

With his presidency coming to a close, Barack Obama urged Americans Tuesday night to rekindle their belief in the promise of change that first carried him to the White House.
He said, "The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.

However, he made no mention of the 10 American sailors picked up by Iran Tuesday.
"The rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better," he admitted.
He also urged steps to make voting easier and to lessen the influence of money in politics.

New Haven Promise is no one-way street.
During the few years these Promise programs have been in place, it has become clear that just providing free tuition is not enough.
The Promise program will be successful if students are able to do well enough in college to finish with a 2-year or 4-year degree.
It may be too soon to tell, but the hope is that the new culture of success will make the difference in the years to come.

Boys also saw problems with football which, unlike the others, is a contact sport.
Doctors see injuries arising from all of these sports, along with cheerleading and dance.
Athletes who had an ACL injury are 10 times more likely to develop arthritis in their knee than those who never had one.
If a child is doing the same sport all year, she is overusing some muscles and not strengthening others.
Girls playing sports should be careful with their knees.
In the meantime, put ice on it and use crutches to try to stay off it.
The risk goes up for girls once they hit age 12 or 13.
I\'m worried about it," Schultz says.
So, what does all this mean for parents, and for their daughters (and sons)?
It found that girls are up to six times more likely to have an ACL injury.
Usually, you feel a pop in the knee and then see swelling, says doctor Randall Schultz.
Sports where kids stop suddenly and turn in a different direction usually are the cause.
Boys also saw problems with football which is a contact sport.
The number of kids with ACL injuries is on the rise because of a change in how kids play sports: These days, more kids are focusing on one sport all year, with few breaks.
About half the athletes were never able to play as well as they had before their injury.
Parents also should get realistic about how much sports their children are doing.

The New Horizons spacecraft mission to Pluto has survived its most dangerous task: making a close approach to the dwarf planet.
Scientists at the Applied Physics Laboratory have examined the last image the spacecraft sent before going into radio silence.
The two sides of the heart have two distinct colors which indicates distinct chemical compositions.
Images from the spacecraft also show the difference between the varied and active surface of Pluto and the darker, grayer, cratered terrain of its largest moon Charon.
For example, it is much redder than Triton, so much so that its surface looks closer to Mars.
The surfaces presumably take their color from hydrocarbons that have been baked by solar radiation, creating dark tars known as "tholins."
The unmanned spacecraft New Horizons has just completed its most difficult job.
It shows one side of Pluto that faces away from its main moon, Charon.
He says the pictures show "a much younger surface on Pluto and an older, more battered surface on Charon."

In 1994, Jean-Marie Chauvet noticed air whistling out from a crack in the rock in southern France, so he and other explorers went to investigate.
"What impressed us," Chauvet said, "was the freshness."
Since then, scientists have determined that cave drawings in El Castillo, Spain, were painted at least 40,000 years ago.
Officials with the Culture Ministry were convicted of falsifying documents to make it look like Chauvet was on official duty when he found it.
But a replica of the 18,000-year-old cave drawings in the Lascaux caves in southwest France draws about 300,000 visitors yearly.
The next step, Terrasse said, could be "a virtual version, 3-D, something that could move around" \u2014 and bring prehistory to the generations of the future.
In 1994, Jean-Marie Chauvet went to investigate a stream of air blowing from a crack in the rock.
The discovery of the long-hidden artwork created a lot of excitement, but the site was quickly closed to the public.
French President Francois Hollande just unveiled the site, and it opens to the public later this month.

In 1994, Jean-Marie Chauvet went to investigate a stream of air blowing from a crack in the rock.
The paintings were so vivid, he said, it felt like the Stone Age artists had just moments ago put down their paint and walked away.
The cave turned out to be remarkably well-preserved thanks to a rock fall about 23,000 years ago that blocked the entrance.
At the time of their discovery, they were the oldest known cave paintings.
"We understood that we had to quickly protect it, and ensure that it was never opened to the public," he said.

DARE, based at the University of Wisconsin, finally reached the last volume including "Z" in 2012.
Discovering such words and preserving them may seem like an unusual pursuit, but it has practical applications.
A couple of months ago, Douglas Kelling, a 68-year-old physician in Concord, North Carolina, was examining an 80-year-old woman when the patient turned to him and asked: "Doc, how\'s my ticklebox?"
For years, DARE has weathered seemingly endless financial crises, somehow always finding last-minute benefactors.
The university has troubles of its own: a proposed two-year, $300 million budget cut from the governor.
If she is unable to find more funding, Hall said she may stay on at 20 percent of her salary and spend the next year "trying to figure out what goes in the archives and what goes elsewhere."

Planned in 1963 by its first editor, Frederic Gomes Cassidy, the project lasted much longer than its first deadline of 1976.
DARE, based at the University of Wisconsin, finally finished its last volume including "Z" in 2012.
A couple of months ago, Douglas Kelling, a 68-year-old doctor in Concord, North Carolina, was examining an 80-year-old woman when the patient turned to him and asked: "Doc, how\'s my ticklebox?"
The confused doctor asked what she meant by "ticklebox."
Chief Editor Joan Houston Hall, who has devoted almost 40 years to the project, recently sent layoff notices to all four DARE staff members.
Hall scans the digital version of DARE, looking up the word bittern, a marsh bird, and admiring the more than 50 regional alternatives, including belcher-squelcher, dunkadoo, conk-onk, fly-up-the-creek and wollerkertoot.
He discovered it was not a term for a species of fish back then, but rather for the process of lightly salting and grilling a fish.
Many of the entries are still kept on the original paper slips collected in the 1960s by DARE field workers.
The end may be near for the 50-year-old Dictionary of American Regional English.

President Barack Obama has belted out lyrics to Al Green\'s "Let\'s Stay Together," led a church congregation through "Amazing Grace," and tweeted his Spotify music playlist.
Spalding, the Grammy Award-winning jazz singer and bassist, said the variety of musicians who have performed at the White House conveys a message of inclusion at what the Obamas have long called the "People\'s House."
"It seems like there is a theme of wanting to really support artists who are working hard \u2014 not just in their craft \u2014 but communicating about the issues of our time," said Spalding.
Spalding said the Obamas believe that "just because you\'re not famous, doesn\'t mean you\'re not important.

On the other hand, seniors Meghan Gingrich and Peyton Kaercher chose to translate the old German directly into English.
Eberhard recently sent an email to Gaa, thanking him and the two students who translated it.
"Without that, I never would have known that history of my great-great grandfather."
Eberhard said reading his great-great grandfather\'s obituary allowed him to "connect some of the dots" of his family\'s history.
"There was so much information in there," he said.
William moved from Belleville to California.
Gaa said the German students are providing "a service to people" who can\'t read German and don\'t live locally.
The assignment to translate the obituary is challenging for the 19 students in his fourth-year class, according to Gaa.
Gaa is available to help as well.
Knipp said it\'s "really cool" to translate the old German obituary into English.
"I like translating this stuff knowing it\'s going to help people."
The German students translate obituaries twice a year \u2014 one time each semester.
The most important thing about the German obituaries is they mention the particular town the immigrant came from, Walsh said.
They work with partners, and Gaa is there to help as well.
Gaa learned about his own family history through this class work, which started in 2012.
So far, the students are almost through the notices published in 1898.

Some of the lawsuits mention reports from the AP.
Verite found that just about all U.S. and European companies that buy seafood from Thailand might have the same problem.
It said it would post the Verite reports online and come up with a plan to try to solve the problem.
All of its suppliers will have to follow tougher rules on how they treat workers.
Verite found children who were forced to fish.
In August, pet food buyers filed a lawsuit in court against the company.
It claimed that fish in Fancy Feast cat food was caught with slave labor in Thailand.
Major League Baseball plans to eliminate home plate collisions, possibly as soon as next season but no later than 2015.
New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson made the announcement Wednesday at the winter meetings.
"Ultimately, what we want to do is change the culture of acceptance that these plays are ordinary and routine and an accepted part of the game," Alderson said.
MLB will also expand the use of instant replay by umpires next season in an effort to eliminate blown calls.

Major League Baseball plans to stop players crashing into catchers at home plate.
Posey, an All-Star catcher, broke a bone in his lower left leg and tore three ligaments in his ankle.
"I don\'t think it\'s completely sparked by anything that\'s happened in baseball as much as what\'s happening outside of baseball and how it\'s impacting people and impacting the welfare of each sport," said Matheny.
So, for example, intentionally running over the catcher might result in an out call."

Uber has introduced uberFAMILY \u2014 an extra $10 charge for a car that arrives with a child\'s car seat \u2014 in New York City and Washington, D.C., and is "exploring the possibility" of launching the service in Chicago, Illinois, according to Anderson.
The drivers double as caregivers, with safeguards aimed at getting parents over the hump of putting their kids in cars with strangers.
They feature more thorough checking of drivers, specialized insurance, tracking apps to monitor progress and responsibilities that extend beyond transportation.
Drivers are trained and allowed to sign kids out of school and help them check in at after-school activities.
"We call them \'caredrivers\' because they are caregivers first and drivers second," said HopSkipDrive co-founder and CEO Joanna McFarland, a Stanford University MBA and one of three moms who launched the service in March.
The first back-to-school season looks to be busy for both new services.
Jeremiah Owyang, an analyst and founder of Silicon Valley, California-based Crowd Companies, said that while there is clearly a market, limiting ride-hailing services to children may not be a great business.
Whether the "can you pick me up" call from a child will be fully replaced by an app remains to be seen.

Hauanio remembers his green, pre-volcano beach town on the east end of the Island of Hawaii as "just one of the beautifulest places on the island.
The lava flow moves in fits and starts, moving for a few days, then pausing for weeks.
Still, Hauanio was determined to stay.
His own house was safe for now, but Hauanio knew that it would be next to go.
It is now a perfect geological example of pahoehoe.
Janet Babb, a geologist with the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said aa is "jagged and rubbly" and can be found high on the slope above Kalapana.

Now, for the second summer in a row, plane wreckage and human remains are being given up by Colony Glacier, more than a dozen miles from the crash site.
The mission to recover and, eventually, identify the human remains is being led by the Hawaii-based U.S. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command and its recovery leader, Gregory Berg.
They couldn\'t see and it flew into the side of Mount Gannett," said Air Force historian Doug Beckstead.
No lost airmen or soldiers have yet been positively identified, but the POW/MIA Command expects that to happen soon.
They are collected, labeled by precise location, kept in a morgue cooler, then shipped to the command laboratory.
Fresh snow 8 feet deep was already covering the glacier, and drifted snow near the wreckage had piled up to hundreds of feet, according to a statement by Air Force 1st Lt. Thomas Sullivan and Terris Moore, a pilot in the Civil Air Patrol.
The impact of the crash also appeared to have triggered avalanches that further buried the debris.
Then this spring, an Army Guard crew monitoring the area spotted a big yellow canister.
It was obvious it was debris from the wreckage," said Lt. Col. Matthew Schell of the Alaska Army National Guard.
A marker left last year had moved 300 yards down the glacier.
Last Tuesday, about 1,800 pounds of material was hauled off the glacier, the first batch removed this year.
The mission to recover and identify the human remains is being led by the Hawaii-based U.S. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command and its recovery leader, Gregory Berg.
In rough weather and battling strong winds, the plane blew 30 miles off course sometime after passing Middleton Island in the Gulf of Alaska.
It was nicknamed "Old Shaky" because of the racket from its big piston engines.
Crews last year removed all that they found, except one tire.
"The things that we keep are things that are directly related to an individual on that aircraft," Berg said.
No lost airmen or soldiers have been identified yet, but the MIA/POW command expects that to happen soon.
The long-frozen remains are in better condition than those found in areas like Vietnam and include tissue as well as bones, Berg said.
Decades passed and the glacier slowly shifted, giving up what it had buried in snow and ice and rubble.
And they may start the effort again next year, if the glacier continues to reveal what it has held for decades.

Determined to keep whaling, Stowe purchased his own whale boat and recruited his own crew of young seamen to train this season.
"Whaling is a tradition around Bequia," Stowe says.
It\'s something they are used to doing and people don\'t like change."
Mitchell is the daughter of former Prime Minister James Mitchell, whose government in the 1980s was the first to vote with pro-whaling Japan at the International Whaling Commission.
"We are no longer involved in the craftsmanship of whale hunting \'Moby Dick\' style."
"There are no whales here to watch," says Stowe, scanning the rough and empty sea.
"As my son said the other day, the only whale I want to watch is the one on my plate."
"It\'s like carnival when you catch a whale," says Stowe, standing next to his whale boat Persecution, inspecting the brass tip of a wooden harpoon.

Then, the harpooner, standing six to eight feet away, throws his harpoon.
Earlier this month, the International Court of Justice banned Japan from hunting whales in the Antarctic.
Published in 1851 by Herman Melville, Moby Dick is a famous novel about the pursuit of a great white whale.
This was despite concerns about inhumane killing methods, using baby whales to lure their mothers and selling whale meat.
Although for today there are no whales in the choppy waters, he says the whales will come back.
"Whaling is a tradition around Bequia," Stowe said.
Japan claims it kills the whales as part of scientific research.
They also say that nothing justifies whaling in Bequia.
As yet, no whales have been captured.
"I don\'t think we\'re going to go out today," says whale hunter Kingsley Stowe.
There used to be at least a dozen whale boats there.
Under international law, islanders can kill no more than four whales during the four-month season.
"Whaling is a tradition around Bequia," Stowe said.
People in Bequia like the taste of whale meat and use whale oil.
Although for today there were no whales, he says the whales will come back.

How well each state is positioned to deal with these challenges and others will vary as well, in part, based on cultural and political realities and history of immigration.
Communities in the South are starting to change.
For generations, Asian-Americans have lived on the coasts of the United States.
Some states in the South have little experience in hosting large immigrant communities.
In Georgia, registered Asian-American voters doubled, while turnout soared 168 percent.
Immigrants from parts of Southeast Asia are likely to have different skills than a highly educated professional from India.
Some states, like Tennessee, have long been a destination for refugees, and might be better ready to respond to a changing population.
Thousands of Asian-Americans have moved away from the big cities on the U.S. coasts and headed South.
By comparison, the Latino population rose 57 percent in the South.
The explosive growth presents several challenges for state and local governments.
Some cities in Georgia are encouraging Asian-American-owned businesses to put up signs in English, so police will know where to go in an emergency.
Asian-Americans, like most minority voting groups, tend to vote Democratic.
By comparison, the Latino population grew 57 percent in the South.
The number actually casting ballots rocketed 180 percent.
In the count, the South includes 16 states from Maryland and Delaware to Florida to Texas and Oklahoma.
In Georgia and North Carolina that population jumped more than 80 percent.
In Atlanta, Georgia, Asian-Americans make up just 5 percent of the population.
There are 111 different languages spoken in the area of one Georgia school district.

"A lot of them are catching up."
But even he was having a hard time wrapping his head around the huge work.
Mother Jones blogger Chris Mooney praised Johnson for summing up climate change in an "understandable, and even moving, way."
Within two weeks of going up last month, the post received nearly 40,000 hits.
"I think there\'s a hunger for a simple and clear" explanation of global warming, said Sightline\'s Anna Fahey.
Johnson, though, prefers not to get involved in what he considers a political debate.
His work has convinced him that some changes caused by global warming are detectable now, and more are certain in the future.
But Johnson was already well acquainted with it.
Eventually, he let the Seattle environmental group Sightline post the booklet on its website.
Haiku might seem like an odd choice for a scientist.

Archaeologists say prehistoric cave paintings in Indonesia were created nearly 40,000 years ago.
Their great age suggests that Europe can no longer claim to be the sole birthplace of art.
"I can say that it was a great \u2014 and very nice \u2014 surprise to read their findings," said Wil Roebroeks, an archaeologist from Leiden University in the Netherlands.
The researchers said they had no idea how old the rock art was when they started on the project about three years ago.
The method was also used to establish the age of rock art in Western Europe.
"The ratio between the two elements acts as a kind of geological clock to date" the deposits, explained Maxime Aubert.
Using this method, the researchers determined that one of the hand outlines was made at least 39,900 years ago.
A painting of an animal called a pig deer was at least 35,400 years old.
In Europe, the oldest known cave painting was of a red disk found in a cave in El Castillo, Spain.
Archaeologists have discovered that dated cave paintings in Indonesia are much older than anyone thought.
"I can say that it was a great \u2014 and very nice \u2014 surprise to read their findings," said Wil Roebroeks.

Archaeologists have two theories about how humans made art at the same time on different continents.
Each group may have come up with the idea of art at about the same time, although they did not know about each other.
Roebroeks said that the old "Europe, the birthplace of art" story was too simple to be true.

Wylie Brys just made the discovery of a lifetime, and he is not even in kindergarten yet.
The latest find is the most complete of all, said SMU paleontologist Louis Jacobs, author of "Lone Star Dinosaurs."
Nodosaurs were kind of the armadillos of the dinosaur world \u2014 short, squat and covered in armored plates with a soft underbelly.
Millions of years ago, the area was then the Western Interior Seaway, an extension of the Gulf of Mexico.
The only one who seems unimpressed by the rare discovery is the boy who found it.
The 4-year-old calls his dinosaur Ralphie after another reptile, his favorite Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle \u2014 Raphael.

For more than a year, kids nationwide have been singing "Let It Go," the hit song from the film "Frozen."
"When you have a jackpot like \'Frozen,\' it can go on forever," said Jason Moser.
"Frozen" is especially attractive because girl-friendly products based on movie characters tend to outsell boy\'s products by 10 percent, Botterman said.
"With girls, there are a lot more fashion items."
The popularity of "Frozen" may eventually prove to be its downfall, some observers said.
"When you begin to play with it or eat it or dress it up, we want to make sure that emotional connection" is there as well, Silverman said.

Such products are made possible by recent advances in technology that allow manufacturers to create nano-sized silver and put it into various materials.
A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter; a human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently began requiring nanosilver manufacturers to register their products, saying the particles could pose different risks than regular silver.
"Manufacturers shy away from labeling things in their products unless it\'s trendy."
Silver kills germs when it oxidizes and releases silver ions, which are deadly to bacteria and yeast.
American pioneers tossed silver coins into water storage barrels to keep water fresh.
Nanoscale silver products have been safely used in swimming pools and to purify water since the 1970s, said Rosalind Volpe, executive director of the Silver Nanotechnology Working Group.
In general, experts agree that humans can safely withstand fairly high doses of silver.
Nanosilver could upset the delicate balance of bacteria inside the digestive tract, said Marina Quadros, associate director of the Virginia Tech Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology.
"If we start using tons of silver nanoparticles and a lot more are going down the drain, then we might start to have an effect we haven\'t seen in the past," said Amy Pruden.

Olson pored over hundreds of photographs and scores of historical maps of Le Havre.
The tall, multiple-masted ships in the painting could only have been in the distant outer harbor if the tides were high.
However, Monet experts chose the November date, since Monet dated his painting "72."

"One of the really overarching questions about Mars is whether there was ever life," Bruce Jakosky, MAVEN\'s principal investigator told reporters last week.
"Both India and NASA are really quite interested in cooperating," said Jim Green, NASA\'s planetary science division director.
For clues, MAVEN will watch to see when and how gas is currently stripped off the top of the atmosphere \u2014 a process that is thought to be driven by solar wind.
MAVEN has been traveling toward Mars since its launch 10 months ago, in November 2013.
"The odds of having an approach that close to Mars are about one in a million years," Jakosky said.
Eventually, it will shrink its current 35-hour orbit to a tighter circle that takes just four and a half hours to complete.
"Both India and NASA are really quite interested in cooperating," said NASA\'s Jim Green.

When the patches of pink skin first showed up on his arm, Ashok Yadav ignored them.
But when pale sores erupted on his body and he lost sensation in his fingertips, a doctor said the devastating word: Yadav had leprosy.
People continue to hide their diseases from families and loved ones out of fear they will be cast out.
Worldwide, the number of new leprosy patients dropped from around 10 million in 1991 to around 230,000 last year.
In India, hospitals and clinics began treating patients with a combination of drugs that effectively kills the germ that causes leprosy.
But pockets of the country continue to have problems with leprosy, including in the central state of Chattisgarh, and Maharashtra in western India.
"They pay us a monthly allowance of 1,800 rupees ($29)," which is nothing, he said.

When pale sores erupted on his body and he lost sensation in his fingertips, a doctor told him the devastating news: Yadav had leprosy.
"What followed was like a nightmare," said Yadav, who has lived in Kasturba Gram, a leper colony outside New Delhi, since he found out he had leprosy 30 years ago.
The stigma or fear of leprosy is still strong in India, even though the country has made great strides against the disease, which is neither highly contagious nor fatal.

It will, he says, completely change the search for extraterrestrial life.
It also would get rid of the risk of bringing home alien diseases, said Ames Director Simon "Pete" Worden.
The game plan was to load samples of the bacteria into a DNA sequencer.
The device, which downloads a DNA sequence and prints out the corresponding nucleic acids, will be available for sale in 2014.
The U.S. government could use it to identify biological weapons in the field \u2014 perhaps dropping a sequencing unit from an aircraft.
Additionally, health agencies could use it during outbreaks of disease.
Venter said the key to finding evidence of life on Mars would be digging deep into the planet, perhaps as deep as a kilometer or more.
Scientists believe that every fifth star in our galaxy has a planet that might hold liquid water \u2014 a key ingredient for life.
That means billions of planets in the Milky Way have the potential to be inhabited by living organisms.

What resembles gibberish to anyone without a degree in computer science could help NBA teams find the best ways to grab rebounds and defend pick and rolls through a software system developed by Maheswaran and Chang.
On his laptop screen, Maheswaran displayed visual tools that teams could use to tweak lineups and position players for favorable outcomes.
But the system Maheswaran and Chang have licensed to four NBA teams through their start-up company, Second Spectrum, could influence the way their clients play.
Assistant general manager Kirk Lacob said the team checked its defensive rotations, lineups and fatigue metrics and made tweaks accordingly.
said Lacob, whose team uses data from a California company called MOCAP Analytics.
The data is electronically transmitted to STATS to be categorized into passes, dribbles, shots and rebounds, among other groupings.
"You can\'t give players a boatload of information and expect them to implement it out on the floor," Rambis said.
Players are conflicted about the value of data \u2014 like, which players prefer to shoot after just two dribbles.

In the new study, published Monday in Nature Geoscience, a different group of researchers took the search for perchlorates one step further.
They found perchlorates in abundance, and it seems like they have been getting hydrated.
They used a method called spectroscopy, which keeps track of what type of light an object absorbs to make conclusions about its composition.
With this method, scientists can identify glass, ice and other substances from miles above the surface.
Morten Bo Madsen of the University of Copenhagen, who co-authored the April study, but was not involved in the latest work, said the new results were significant.

President Barack Obama urged Congress on Wednesday to raise wages and secure the social safety net, issuing an appeal to correct economic inequalities that he said make it harder for a child to escape poverty.
"The basic bargain at the heart of our economy has frayed," the president said in remarks at a nonprofit community center.
He acknowledged his administration\'s "poor execution" in rolling out the flawed health care website that was supposed to be an easy means of purchasing insurance.

The electric barrier on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal is the last line of defense to stop an Asian carp invasion of Lake Michigan.
Concerned that the barrier was too weak to repel small fish, in 2011 the Army Corps increased its voltage.
Federal officials stressed they do not believe Asian carp are yet getting past the barrier.
But, Great Lakes advocates want the canal physically plugged to stop Asian carp and other unwanted species from swimming freely between the Great Lakes and Mississippi basin.
He said news of the electrical barrier problems is further evidence that the federal government has to find a more permanent solution to the Asian carp problem.
The study also revealed that small fish are not always stopped by the electrical current in the water.
In fact, a camera lowered into the canal at the barrier site regularly captured schools of fish swimming freely through the barrier.
Of those 72 samples, entire schools of fish were recorded swimming through the barrier 61 percent of the time.
The study may prompt changes in the way barges are configured and how the barrier operates.
She said they\'re going to do more studying "and work with the barge community and the Coast Guard to see how we can move forward."

Only two California school districts, Sierra Sands Unified and San Diego Unified, have said they could put up the 20 percent matching funds for repairs.
"We lost millions on this program because of sequestration," Wright said.
School officials would like to replace the roof, buy new playground equipment and new doors for classrooms and offices, which currently only lock from the outside.
There are also electrical improvements to consider, such as upgrading lighting and installing air conditioning.
Public school districts are often able to cover major maintenance and construction costs with the help of money raised through property taxes.
Last year, the California Department of Education asked the Department of Finance to provide $61 million in funding, which would cover the 20 percent matching for the 10 California schools on the list.
Last year, State Senator Jean Fuller, a Republican from Bakersfield, proposed a bill that would have provided the 20 percent matching to some of the base schools.
Muroc Joint Unified has tried to raise the matching funds on its own, chief business officer Trevor Walker said.
Although the district at first said it could provide the matching funds, it is struggling to do so, Ernie Bell, the superintendent, said.

That does not work for military base schools, because they are on federal land, which is not taxed.
However, the bill did not even make it to a vote.
Without the federal aid, Fuller said, California may have to pay the entire cost of repairs itself.
Muroc Joint Unified has tried to raise the money on its own, chief business officer Trevor Walker said.
However, it will only pay 80 percent of the cost.

For decades, toymakers believed that boys wanted to build things and girls wanted to play princess.
But women are now leading huge corporations, including Yahoo and General Motors, and more women are becoming engineers and mathematicians.
Eager to make building toys, Mattel in April acquired Mega Brands, known for its construction sets.
While boys are often satisfied just by building something cool-looking, girls want more of a story behind their construction toys, experts say.
Circuits power lights and a working fan.
Later sets let kids build miniature spinning windmills and elevators that go up and down.
Dulce Aguilar said she would consider buying a girl-oriented construction set for her goddaughter, who is not interested in "princess gifts."
"It\'s a great opportunity for girls to learn skills in terms of building and how to support a structure," the Aguilar said.
"Most in the toy industry told me the idea would never go mainstream and in order to appeal to girls, it had to be sparkly with ponies," she said.
After raising money online on Kickstarter, GoldieBlox rolled out a pastel-colored construction set that came with a book featuring the adventures of Goldie, a girl inventor.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie chomped down on a jelly doughnut and mocked his own weight on "The Late Show with David Letterman."
Ten days later, he underwent a secret medical procedure to help him lose weight.
No mention of the procedure at an event two days after the surgery or at any of the other meetings Christie held that week.
"If I had the choice, I wouldn\'t have ever talked about it," Christie said on Tuesday, confirming a news report about his surgery nearly three months ago.
The governor, who throughout his career has joked about his weight, said it was his plan all along never to acknowledge publicly that he had undergone gastric band surgery.
It is, Christie said, a deeply private matter for a man who has struggled for decades with his weight.
And he insisted it has absolutely nothing to do with politics, even though he is up for re-election and is said to be a potential 2016 Republican candidate for president.
Christie told reporters in a televised news conference on Tuesday that he decided to have the surgery because of his wife, Mary Pat, and their four children.
"My long-term goal is to get myself into a position where I\'m healthier and I can live a longer life and be an active parent and hopefully someday grandparent," Christie said, adding that his youngest two children are in elementary school.
How much weight he has lost, how much he weighs now, and how much he plans to lose were all questions Christie said he would not answer.
New York Jets coach Rex Ryan offered his personal experiences with the same surgery, but Christie said he never told the coach that he was considering the surgery at the time.
Less than two weeks before his surgery, Christie appeared on "The Late Show," where he pulled a doughnut out of his pocket and took a bite as Letterman asked Christie if his jokes about the governor\'s weight bothered him.
Christie replied his heft was "fair game" but also said, "I\'m basically the healthiest fat guy you\'ve ever seen in your life."
The remark, which Christie said his children heard, drew fire from the governor, who called Mariano a "hack who wants five minutes on TV."
During a news conference after the Letterman appearance, he said "there\'s always a plan" to shed pounds.
"Now that he\'s governor, it doesn\'t matter because as long as he hasn\'t had a health scare, and the only thing that we know about is a trip to the emergency room for an asthma attack, the only thing people judge him on is his performance," Murray said.
He pointed to an October 2011 poll in which 20 percent of those surveyed said it was appropriate to talk about weight in a presidential race.
"You have to take him on his word on that because he\'s been talking about that for years, but you have to think that the looming presidential election in three years, which we all know he wants to run in, gave him that extra push to try something he wouldn\'t have otherwise," Murray said.

On Thursday, two consumer advocacy groups often critical of corporate advertising tactics launched a petition drive urging the Girl Scouts of the USA to end the partnership.
"This is product placement at its worst," said New American Dream\'s executive director, Wendy Philleo.
Girl Scouts CEO Anna Maria Chavez announced the partnership last year, describing both her own organization and Barbie as "American icons."
Said Linn, the campaign director: "The website is little more than an interactive ad for Barbie promoting the brand\'s ...  message that women really are what they wear."
Linn said she communicated privately with the Girl Scouts last year, hoping they would end the Mattel partnership without the need for a public advocacy campaign.
It also has helped block proposed state laws that would have allowed ads on school buses.
"Together, we are teaching girls that their futures are wide open with possibilities," Chavez said.
It now has a membership of 54,000, many of them parents.
It also has helped stop proposed state laws that would have allowed advertising on school buses.
This time it is over a business partnership between her manufacturer, Mattel, and the Girl Scouts.
On Thursday, two consumer advocacy groups launched a petition drive urging the Girl Scouts of the USA to end the partnership.
Her group opposes the commercialization of American culture.
Mattel was widely criticized for the placement, although it received some praise.
It promoted the campaign with the slogan "unapologetic."
Notably, it forced several companies to halt or modify advertising claiming that some videos and other products could help infants learn.
It says this would "improve quality of life, protect the environment, and promote social justice."
Because it is large and well-known, the Girl Scouts have been a frequent target of criticism over the years.
"This is product placement at its worst," said Wendy Philleo.
Parisi said Mattel gave the Girl Scouts $2 million for the Barbie programs.

Sweden has been forced to come to terms with a troubling new reality: For the first time in generations, the country is witnessing people living in poverty, without electricity or running water.
Their numbers rose sharply last year, he said.
Roma are only eligible for emergency aid, which includes a few days of food and housing at homeless shelters and help returning home.
"I heard from others it was easier to earn money here," said Maria Carmen, a 38-year-old Roma from Romania with six children who came to Sweden two weeks ago.
In August, an extreme political party placed ads in the Stockholm subway apologizing to foreign tourists for "the mess" caused by the beggars.
Trash piled up between the flimsy homes, and neighbors complained as the smell of human waste and bonfires spread in the area.
Valfridsson said that Swedes should support efforts to help the Roma in their home countries.
It is much more helpful to them than "dropping coins in a cup," he said.
For the first time in many years, people are living in poverty in Sweden.
About 650 Roma live in 60 small camps in Stockholm, she said.

In addition, homeowners could use the software to create an online tour of their houses before putting them up for sale, Roumeliotis said.
The software is being designed to work on an upcoming Google smartphone, but it will also work on existing smartphones.
It doesn\'t use much processing power, about as much as the game "Angry Birds," Roumeliotis said.
Google often spends years testing a new product before releasing it to the public, Strawn said.
"There\'s a lot of valuable brainpower in the university system, and that\'s what Google needs to move these projects forward," he explained.
Roumeliotis points out that you could map the inside of the Mall of America today, but it would take many computers and a lot of time.
Wal-Mart managers in Texas have a new job: asking customers if they have a permit to carry a handgun.
Cashiers or door greeters who see someone with a gun are to alert the highest-ranking manager.
Gun-control advocates, meanwhile, are avoiding stores that allow customers to bear arms, saying no one should have to shop where they feel unsafe.
A restaurant or store can lose its liquor license if it "knowingly allows" a person to bring an illegal firearm on the premises, said Chris Porter.

"As an alternative to cutting a lot of programs, districts went the route of charging fees for sports events, uniforms, after-school activities \u2014 and eventually transportation."
That\'s just really unfortunate and a shame," said Mike Martin, executive director of the National Association for Pupil Transportation.
Students in grades 7 through 12 in Franklin, Massachusetts, pay $325 each, but no more than $975 per family.
And the Poway Unified School District in San Diego County, California, bills $575 a year per child, with a limit of $1,437 for three or more children.
"It costs $3.5 million a year to run the transportation program," she said.
"The state only gives us $86,000."
Parents of students living farther away must pay for bus service.
"Technology fees, book fees, athletic fees, and now bus fees.

Mike Huckabee, the folksy former Arkansas governor, preacher and television host, has entered the 2016 presidential race.
Now everyone knows who he is," said Bob Vander Plaats, who served as Huckabee\'s Iowa co-chairman in 2008 and is currently not sure whom he will support.
A poll released Monday, however, shows that just over half of registered Republican voters said they could see themselves casting a ballot for the former governor.
Country versus country club was a constant contrast Huckabee made against Romney, and one he will likely make against Bush, who is expected to run.
He was criticized for supporting some tax increases when he was governor.

"So people are going to want to take a test drive, kick the tires, and sit inside all the new cars, look at all the new candidates and see if that\'s the direction they want to go," Vander Plaats said that Huckabee hopes that his supporters will take a look at other candidates and then vote for him.
Rubio, Walker and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush received far more support.
Both are dominated by evangelical voters and hold two of the first nominating contests in the nation.

A makeshift bucket brigade hauled 14 pails of mud and slush from the tent that Um Mahmoud shares with a dozen other Syrian refugees in a settlement here in the Bekaa Valley.
she said, pulling back a curtain to show a bare kitchen stocked with meager provisions and subject to rat attacks.
The views were of little comfort to displaced Syrians, many of whom were found in their improvised enclaves clearing out the snow, slush and mud that had made an already difficult life more grueling.
Tiny Lebanon is now home to more than 1 million Syrian refugees, officials say; that means that about 1 in 5 residents of the country is a Syrian.
Lebanon is a nation where political power is carefully parceled out among Christians, Druze, Sunni Muslims and Shiite Muslims.
Aid arrives irregularly, and in haphazard fashion, refugees say, despite the work of United Nations relief teams and charitable agencies.
"It has been freezing cold here and fuel was like gold," said Ahmad Awadh, a resident of another camp in the Bekaa area.
A majority of the tents appear to have both portable heaters and stoves and some have electrical connections.
Still, residents complain that delivery of aid comes randomly, enrolling children in schools is next to impossible, and finding a job is a fantasy.
Given the dire situation in Syria, many reckoned they were lucky to be in Lebanon.

Or, as is happening more frequently in China, they discover that livestock are missing or mauled.
In China, the number of Siberian tigers living in the wild (far smaller than those in zoos) has been listed in government statistics at between 18 and 22 for some years, said Li Zhixing, 60, who has worked for decades on tiger protection.
"I personally think the number of tigers has doubled in the last decade and that the area populated by tigers has become much larger," said Li.
But in recent years, China has caught up and might even be moving ahead in creating habitats where tigers can thrive, Li said.
Here in Jilin province, the Forestry Ministry has designated a wildlife preserve containing 108,700 acres of forest, the favorite habitat of the tiger.
We are always in groups of two or three so there is somebody to scare off the tiger," said Qi Shuyan, 46, who works on the same ranch in Jintang as Liu.
Li, the tiger expert, says attacks on humans are rare here because of Chinese respect for the tiger, revered by many as a mountain god.

But in rural Kern County, Calif., David Cain is working to win the stomachs and wallets of grocery shoppers.
Ordinary grapes like the red Flame Seedless can cost as little as 88 cents per pound.
California is now churning out other sweet inventions, including apriums (a pluot but with more apricot in it), peacharines (peach and nectarine) and cherums (cherry and plum).
Cain got his start in the 1970s as a researcher with the USDA, developing new varieties of table grapes and seedless raisins in Fresno, Calif. Then, most fruit breeding was done by the government or universities that could afford the time-consuming and expensive work.
Cain went to the private sector in 1987 just as U.S. grape consumption was exploding, thanks to new seedless varieties developed in California.
He helped start International Fruit Genetics in 2001.
A few months later at a trade event, he tasted the grape that has obsessed him ever since.
But its cotton candy flavor transported Cain to a carnival or county fair.
A Bakersfield grower is set to harvest the first large crop in August.
He is a former scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) who now heads research at privately owned International Fruit Genetics in Bakersfield, Calif.

Even a drizzle will flood it with sewage, thanks to the outflow pipes.
"It\'s just like swimming through a dirty diaper," he says.
Cement trucks and other heavy vehicles shook the bridges as Swain swam underneath, and a bulldozer dumped gravel into one of the several cement plants that line the canal.
Before it became an industrial dumping ground in 1848, the canal was a tidal stream in a swamp.
The agency plans to dig up hundreds of thousands of tons of muck from the bottom of the canal, and then incinerate it, by 2022.
He adds that he could not even see his gloved hands at the ends of his arms when swimming, especially since he kept kicking the bottom and stirring up whatever lurks down there \u2014 including toxic chemicals and heavy metals like lead.
He describes the water as cold and a bit fatty, demonstrating by smearing it on a metal fence.

The blaze also came within 12 miles of 10 breeding pairs of the subspecies of red fox clinging to survival in the cold, steep slopes above the tree line.
Federal wildlife biologists are also concerned about the loss of potential habitat for the Pacific fisher, which belongs to the weasel family.
That effort was interrupted by the federal government shutdown, which furloughed federal wildlife biologists.
Preliminary reports from the fire area indicated that the blaze destroyed or damaged dozens of nesting and roosting areas for spotted owls, goshawks and great gray owls \u2014 the largest owl in North America.
On a recent weekday, however, John Keane, a U.S. Forest Service research wildlife ecologist, found a reason for some optimism about 10 miles west of Yosemite where he has studied great gray owls for 15 years.
Meadows there, edged with 80-foot-tall cedars and ponderosa pines, were spared by the fire, which began burning in August.
Two months after the fire raged across one of the wildest areas in the state,  animals continue searching for food and shelter in, as one resident put it, "patches of green, wherever they can find them."

Early reports said that the blaze hit dozens of areas where spotted owls, goshawks and great grey owls nest.
But John Keane, a U.S. Forest Service research wildlife ecologist, found a reason for cautious optimism about 10 miles west of Yosemite.
"If I had to put money on it, I\'d say there are still owls here," Keane said.
Those competing interests are already playing out on fire-stripped slopes.
A wildfire burned a huge area of the Sierra Nevada forests last summer.
Even without that information, the government is coming up with ideas to help protect the animals.
The idea is to save certain species from being wiped out.

It was Christmas Eve 2003 when Dennis and Dawn Zucca learned their 10-month-old boy had cancer.
"Enjoy him the best you can" their doctors said, telling the Zuccas that Peter had only two months to live.
Peter was just learning to walk again when a lump was found in the leg.
The hardest part still, Peter said, is "not being able to play the same way."

Autism is usually thought of as a serious developmental problem.
This small but important study, the first of its type, "makes us better aware of the unique talents that these people have," said Teresa Iuculano, lead author of the study.
They studied 36 youngsters, age 7 to 12.
On standardized math tests, the children with autism did significantly better than the others.
While other children counted on their fingers or memorized answers, the autistic children broke the problem down into parts.
For instance, if asked the sum of 7 plus 4, they would add 7 plus 3, then add one.
This occurred in a part of a brain just below the ears, called the ventral temporal occipital cortex.
"This different brain architecture might even ... [help] certain strong skills to develop, such as problem-solving, even though there are things that they may not be good at," said Iuculano.
Autism is usually thought of as a serious problem.
But people with autism can also have exceptional skills or talents, known as "savant" abilities.

Autism is usually thought of as a serious problem.
Now, though, a new study suggests that autism may not be a problem after all.
The children with autism were found to have better math skills.
This new understanding may help children with autism have an easier time in school and, later, at work, she said.
Like all those with autism, the children with autism had difficulty talking with people.
But people with autism can also have exceptional skills or talents, known as "savant" abilities.
But the discovery of math talents in such children is particularly important.
Perhaps children with autism only have greater math skills because they practice so much.
But they believe there is more to it than that.
They studied 36 children, age 7 to 12.
On math tests, the children with autism did much better than the others.
They were using a part of a brain just below the ears, called the ventral temporal occipital cortex.
Normally, the ventral temporal occipital cortex is used to interpret things we see, including faces.
"This different brain architecture might even [help] certain strong skills to develop, such as problem-solving, even though there are things that they may not be good at," said Iuculano.

President Barack Obama on Wednesday asked world leaders at the United Nations to "choose hope over fear" and help fight the extremist group Islamic State (ISIL) in Syria and Iraq.
"There can be no reasoning \u2014 no negotiation \u2014 with this brand of evil.
The United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death."
Videos posted on social media showed Syrian civilians picking through the rubble of destroyed homes.
"It is time for a new compact among the civilized peoples of this world to eradicate war at its most fundamental source: the corruption of young minds by violent ideology."
We will demonstrate that the future belongs to those who build \u2014 not those who destroy."
President Barack Obama explained in a speech on Wednesday why the U.S. was dropping bombs in Iraq and Syria.
The group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and has also been called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
"The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force."

The National Football League (NFL) may soon have a new football team \u2014 based in London, England.
The idea of permanently basing a team in London has been growing since the NFL first brought regular-season games to the city in 2007.
The National Football League (NFL) may soon have a new football team \u2014 in London, England.
It warns that American football fans could react negatively to the idea of their Super Bowl in London.
The idea of permanently basing a team in London has been growing since the NFL first brought regular-season games to the city in 2007.
If it started when it was 4 p.m. on the East Coast in the United States, that would mean it was 9 p.m. in London.
The two games held in 2013 generated $52 million for London, the study says.
A switch to four games a year would likely bring an additional $42 million in profits, bringing the total to some $94 million.
The NFL could instead chose to increase the number of International Series games held in London.
It would likely bring an additional $42 million in profits, for a total of $94 million.

According to a study released Wednesday, a new London team could be very good for Britain.
If the team hosts eight home games in a season, the study says, the city could see $165 million in higher profits.
Throughout Britain as a whole, a London team could lead to $252 million in new profits per season.

One of the most common excuses for throwing out food is that people "want to eat only the freshest food."
The other common reason is a fear of food poisoning.
The amount of food that goes to waste in the United States has increased in recent years.
That is almost a quarter more food than Americans tossed out in 2000.
The problem is often caused by the unreasonable standards we have set for foods sold in stores.
"This apple isn\'t good enough for me," isn\'t one of them.

Taste is the sense that lets us appreciate the beauty of good food.
Now scientists believe they have found a sixth basic taste that could profoundly change the way we eat.
Mattes said that if people learn to work with the taste of fat correctly in the kitchen, it will allow us to make lots of foods taste better by either reproducing the taste of fat or introducing substitutes that successfully mimic it.
Receptors are all over our taste buds, too \u2014 there are as many as 100 taste receptors on each taste bud.
How we experience a mouthful of food depends on how the chemicals in the foods interact with the receptors on our tongues.
In order to figure out that fat could be another one of the basic tastes, Mattes conducted two experiments.
In the first, more than 100 participants were given solutions that had one of six different tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami and fatty.
"We\'re pretty sure that they did that because bitterness, umami-ness and fattiness, when isolated, can be pretty strange," Mattes said.
The combination of those two things is what is important."
Taste is the sense that allows us to appreciate the beauty of good food.

The fat taste that he is talking about is hidden in a bite of steak or a dollop of olive oil.
People have five senses.
The sensation we feel when eating a piece of cake, chewing on a hamburger or taking the first bite of a piping hot piece of pizza is triggered when chemicals in our food interact with receptors in our mouths and send signals to our brains.
For hundreds of years, they believed there were four primary tastes: sweet, sour, salty and bitter.
Now scientists believe they have found a sixth primary taste that could change the way we eat.
In a new study, researchers found evidence that fat actually interacts with human taste buds in a way similar to the five primary tastes.
Many scientists believed it could change the way we experience food in the same way that tastes such as sweet and sour do.
People have five senses.

Then last week, violent attacks on immigrant shopkeepers in Durban townships exploded.
Violence spread in central Durban on Tuesday, after looters attacked shops owned by immigrants.
On Friday, in the worst attack in the latest unrest, two Ethiopian brothers near Durban were locked in their small shop in a shipping container, which had been set on fire by a mob.
The African Diaspora Forum also reported a threat to firebomb a building in the town of Mthatha, in the Eastern Cape, that houses many foreign-owned shops.
Bereje Fana, spokesman for the Ethiopian Community Association, said the organization had been pressing South African authorities to take attacks on immigrants more seriously and to protect them.

Instead, French children \u2014 who, like their parents, already enjoy longer lunch breaks and summer vacations than their counterparts in many other countries \u2014 have to show up for class Monday through Friday.
Their leisurely Tuesday evenings, when the family could go out to dinner or Sacha could watch TV without worrying about class the next morning, have been sabotaged.
This was imposed upon us," said Isabelle, 41, a dark-haired woman full of indignation and expressive gestures.
Because French students had Wednesdays off, as well as a relatively short school year, educators were forced to pack more hours into each remaining school day in order to achieve an annual amount of instruction time equal to other developed nations.
Adding Wednesday to the mix is supposed to lighten that burden, at a time when the declining performance of French students is becoming a source of heavy concern.
Everybody agrees that the day is too compressed and that something needs to be changed," said Peter Gumbel, a professor at Sciences Po university here.
And moms and dads who have artfully arranged their workweeks to spend Wednesdays with their tots feel shafted.
"We have this midweek day off which helps the kids relax, to establish their own rhythm, to stay up a little longer (on Tuesdays) with us," said Eric, Sacha\'s father.
"The day after, there is no stress, no push in the morning to wake up to go to school.
Businesses have sprung up to serve the Wednesday whims of middle class families, offering such get-ahead programs for youngsters as English classes.

By the time they turn 15, nearly 40 percent of French students have had to repeat a grade \u2014 triple the average rate of most industrialized countries.
The new schedule has sparked protests from teachers and letters from parents.
The deeply unpopular government of President Francois Hollande, who pledged the change during his election campaign last year, is struggling to defend it.
Because French students had Wednesdays off, as well as a relatively short school year, educators were forced to pack more hours into each remaining school day.
Adding Wednesday to the mix is supposed to lighten that burden, at a time when the declining scores of French students is becoming a real concern.
When France created public education in the late 19th century, the government gave a weekly day off for children to attend classes held by the Roman Catholic Church.
And moms and dads who have arranged their workweeks to spend Wednesdays with their tots feel cheated.
The day after, there is "no push in the morning to wake up to go to school."
More than 15 percent drop out or finish school without a degree.
Children as young as 6 stay in class late in the afternoon, until skies go dark and parents get off work.
The parents group she leads is now urging members to pull their kids out of school next Wednesday in protest.
The outcry may seem to outsiders like a case of French whine.

McGraw-Hill Education sought to correct these implied untruths in a Facebook announcement Friday.
However, it went on to say, a close review revealed that "our language in that caption did not adequately convey that Africans were both forced into migration and to labor against their will as slaves."
"They can send out a supplement.
Dean-Burren added, "Minimizing slavery in any way is a way of saying those black lives, those black bodies, that black pain didn\'t matter enough to give it a full description."
McGraw-Hill was one of a handful of textbook companies that came under fire after the Texas State Board of Education adopted new standards for its social studies curriculum in 2010.
Most of the textbooks found to be problematic in the review were nevertheless approved.
It read: "The Atlantic Slave Trade between the 1500s and 1800s brought millions of workers from Africa to the southern United States to work on agricultural plantations."
It "is a way of saying those black lives, those black bodies, that black pain didn\'t matter enough to give it a full description."
The publisher has been criticized for its Texas textbooks before.
"It\'s kind of like teaching physics and stopping at Newton without bringing in Einstein," said Countryman.

By now, Jeramey Winfield thought he would be working in downtown Chicago.
I wanted to give her some relief," said Winfield, who was the first in his family to go to college.
But more than a year after graduating from Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire, Winfield still does not have a full-time job.
In fact, he said, he is rarely called back for an interview.
They also are more likely to be in a job that does not require a college degree and are being paid less than white workers with the same experience.
Even African-Americans who studied science, technology, engineering and math \u2014 winning fields in the job market \u2014 have had a hard time finding work, said John Schmitt.
He is a senior economist with the Center for Economic and Policy Research and co-authored the new report, "A College Degree is No Guarantee."
Like Winfield, many of these graduates were the first in their family to attend college.
That has made their search for work all the more urgent, and their failure a greater hardship.
Among recent black graduates ages 22 to 27, the jobless rate in 2013 was 12.4 percent, compared with 5.6 percent for whites.
"Jeramey is just a wonderful person who made our campus a better place," said the college\'s president, Tom Galligan, who became friends with Winfield.

While not an advocate for stem cell therapy, as one of the few athletes who have gone public on the treatment, he understands why active players approach him about it.
Yet while Bradley is excited about its potential, he still spends a fair amount of time explaining what exactly stem cell therapy does.
But nearly all evidence is anecdotal \u2014 no absolute lab results show it works.
Clinics in various countries in Europe, Australia and Asia offer stronger therapies.
Patients can have stem cells taken out and then grown in a laboratory for weeks, producing millions more cells.
He has referred some patients (not Steelers, following team policy) to a clinic in the Cayman Islands he considers safe.
"There is so much hype, so much marketing," said Dr. Matthew Matava, president of the NFL\'s Physician Society.

Adult stem cells are similar cells found throughout the body that can divide rapidly and help repair tissue.
To avoid scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration, stem cell doctors generally perform one-day procedures similar to what Nitkowski received.

He was 38 and his fastball traveled just 50 miles an hour.
Surgery and a lengthy rehabilitation after would have ended his career.

Parkour, a sport which treats the world as one big obstacle course, is becoming increasingly popular.
It borrows elements from martial arts, gymnastics, rock climbing and other athletic fields to enable participants to turn obstacles like park benches, trees, guardrails and buildings into tools they can use to nimbly propel themselves forward.
Beginners who want to hit the ground running \u2014 but maybe not by running up a construction crane, James Bond-style \u2014 have the option of classes like those offered by London-based Parkour Generations.
Classes include a warm-up, technical drills to learn the basics of safety, and games to teach and reinforce parkour techniques.
They teach students how to walk on or hurtle over balance beams and lift, leap or weave their way through whatever else was in their path.

In 2011, a Nevada public elementary school decided to require students to wear a uniform.
The panel said the words "Tomorrow\'s Leaders" potentially violated students\' right to free speech, and the uniform policy must go unless the school district can justify it under a legal standard.
The "policy compels speech because it mandates the written motto, \'Tomorrow\'s Leaders,\' on the uniform shirts," wrote Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen, an Obama appointee.
"The exemption explicitly favors the uniforms of the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts over all other uniforms," the court said.
Siding with the mother were a student organization and a national legal group that advocates for religious liberty.
In ruling for the mother, the 9th Circuit cited a 1977 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down a New Hampshire law requiring motorists to display license plates with the state motto, "Live Free or Die."
But they also would have to permit similar attire without the motto and the uniforms of other groups in addition to the Scouts.

Since then, Pooh and his friends have been in many television shows and movies and can be found in stuffed animal collections everywhere.
He joked that since he was an adult, it was time to give up his childhood companion.
The Times made the case for the return of Pooh.
"It is obvious then that Winnie-the-Pooh, whatever else he is, is not an American," The Times argued.
"The librarians themselves leave Winnie a pot of honey and a red balloon every year on his birthday \u2014 he is a cherished part of everyday life" at the library, she explained.
The bear has lived there ever since.
Pooh is just a stuffed animal, after all.
Angela Montefinise, who works at the library, said Pooh is comfortable where he is.
Should Pooh stay in New York or go back to England?
Fleeing poverty in Kentucky, Rose Will Monroe piled her son and daughter into a bus in 1942.
Monroe was just one of 6 million American women who entered the workforce during World War II, about half of them in the defense industry.
Monroe became "Rosie the Riveter," the image of the tough, hardworking American woman who helped win the war.
"Rosie" was first popularized by a song, and she soon came to represent all women working in defense jobs.
"There were quite a few faces of Rosie," said Croston, who spoke in honor of Women\'s History Month at Lockheed Martin.
Monroe\'s story is inspiring for today\'s "Rosies" at Lockheed Martin, said Gayle Roland, a senior manager there.

When he learned that there really was a riveter named Rose on the job, he made her a showpiece of his movies.
"They were so willing to pitch in and help."
Among them are Lorraine Martin, who heads the F-35 program in Fort Worth, and Janet Nash, vice president for producing F-35s.
She noted that a modern rivet hammer weighs 2.5 pounds.

Fifty years ago, Colombia shipped its first batch of fresh-cut flowers to Miami and jump-started a billion-dollar industry.
In a handful of decades, flowers in the United States went from being high-end luxury goods sold only at specialized shops to being commonplace.
Inspired by Wells\' work, Cheever wrote a paper in 1967, titled "Bogota, Colombia, as a Cut-Flower Exporter for World Markets."
"He said, \'Why don\'t we get into that business.\'"
One of them was a Colorado State University student named David Cheever.
In 1969, he and two brothers started growing carnations on a 2.5-acre plot of land.
"They work by the square foot," he said of chain stores such as Costco and Walmart.
Things began to take off in the early 1970s after Weston established El Dorado Trading Company in Miami.
"After that, flowers were going straight into refrigeration, and we had sales girls who could talk to all of the cities in the United States," he said.
Now, there are around 350 flower growers in Colombia, with 130,000 workers.
Fifty years ago, Colombia shipped its first batch of fresh-cut flowers to Miami.
"He saw that Washington was full, full of socialites and all they did was go to parties and take each other presents, which were often flowers," Weston said of Wells.
In 1961, President John F. Kennedy launched the Alliance for Progress, which aimed to create a better relationship between the United States and its Latin American neighbors.
Soon, many people in the U.S. "will not only want flowers for Valentine\'s Day but as a year-round consumer good," he said.
They can be bought everywhere from grocery stores to gas stations.
Since then, Colombian flowers have grown into a billion dollar business.
The future looks even brighter, said Colombian Agriculture Minister Aurelio Iragorri.
Soon, many people in the U.S. "will not only want flowers for Valentine\'s Day," he said.

The firm now is working in Kenya on an effort, also supported by the Gates Foundation, to develop a similarly simple device for areas that lack abundant water.
The Caltech toilet \u2014 with its solar panel and battery \u2014 also has been criticized as being too complicated.
Hoffmann, though, is convinced that technology can help solve sanitation problems where other approaches, he said, have had little success.
Some use "hanging latrines" that dump directly into streams, or buckets that are simply emptied in the streets.
"That\'s very, very expensive," said Doulaye Kone, an engineer who grew up in a village in Africa\'s Ivory Coast.

Under the Americans With Disabilities Act, state and local governments, businesses and nonprofit organizations that serve the public generally must allow service animals to accompany those with disabilities in all areas of the facility where the public is normally allowed to go.
Some advocates, for instance, are concerned that doing so may put an unreasonable burden on those with disabilities to prove their dog is legitimate.
The dog also opens and shuts doors, retrieves the phone, picks up objects she drops, and helps open the refrigerator and cabinets.
Some states have laws against residents pretending to have a legally protected disability in order to gain access for their dog.
A search of eBay under "service dog patches" revealed more than 22,000 sellers.
Fake service-dog certificates, vests and harnesses for use on ordinary pets are showing up all over.

City officials here had long worried that a patient infected with Ebola would eventually appear somewhere in this busy, chaotic city.
New York and New Jersey announced mandatory quarantines for anyone traveling from three West African nations who have had direct contact with an Ebola patient.
Cleaners wearing protective suits and boots carried blue plastic waste-collection drums into the apartment to begin the hours-long decontamination process.
Pedro Vanegas, who lives and works across the street from the apartment building, said he was not worried.
"I don\'t like the idea that the country is letting people come and go from these West African countries like normal," said Kenneth Clarke, who lives in the neighborhood.
Juan Perez, whose family lives down the block, said his parents had not sent his younger sister to her school across the street out of fear she could catch Ebola.
Officials at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York also will conduct interviews with passengers coming from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Seth Wilner has been the go-to guy for agricultural questions in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, for 15 years.
Today, fewer than 2 percent of Americans farm for a living, and only 17 percent live in rural areas.
"Extension back in the day was funded about one-third federal, one-third state and one-third county," said Sonny Ramaswamy, director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.
"People say programs are more focused and better quality," although, she admitted, "It\'s a challenge letting people know what we are doing."

"The Great British Bake Off," a televised baking contest for amateur pastry chefs, has become one of the most popular shows in Britain.
Hussain said on Thursday that winning the show was "one of the best moments of my life."
She said she made her winning creation, which she dubbed her "big fat British wedding cake," because she didn\'t have a cake when she got married in Bangladesh 10 years ago.
The Muslim Association of Britain said her victory "has demonstrated the connection that young British Muslims have with British society."
Two hosts, comedians Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc, add encouragement and humor.
The show had a modest start, but ratings rose from about 3 million viewers for the first season to 10 million by the fifth.

Lake Mission Viejo is Southern California at its most picturesque and, when it comes to water, its most extravagant.
Now, almost 40 years after first-term Governor Jerry Brown criticized officials for filling the lake "while others use buckets to collect water in their showers," Mission Viejo is under scrutiny again as the state struggles through another relentless drought.
"You have to hand it to them \u2014 (a lake) was a fantastic idea.
But today, that water should be available for indoor use, not outdoor recreation," said Stephanie Pincetl, director of the California Center for Sustainable Communities.
Today, the lake is part of a "complete, year-round resort," with beaches, parks, clubhouses and a stage that hosts summer concerts.
Mission Viejo, state officials said, may be the largest manufactured lake in the Greater Los Angeles Area that is solely recreational.
The association that owns and operates the lake is talking with state officials about ways to use less water while keeping the lake filled.
High-end homes along the lake can sell for more than $3 million.
In response, the California Water Board ordered Mission Viejo Company to stop filling the massive hole it had dug for the lake.
A year later the drought ended, and the board allowed the company to fill the lake with water from the Colorado River.
The lake is not open to the public.
They are angered by the suggestion of reducing or changing the lake levels.
According to water-use expert Conner Everts, creating a "giant swimming pool for the few" with precious publicly owned water "makes no sense at all."
In a state with a lot of inequality when it comes to water, Mission Viejo stands out for its wastefulness, Everts said.
But when it comes to water use, some say it is also particularly wasteful.
To use it, one must join the association and pay dues of more than $200 a year.
If the drought worsens, private lakes could face restrictions as well.

had earned the place of a full-fledged word, though an admittedly odd one.
All the words had a single syllable, and they were typically limited to a low-front vowel, something similar to "ah" or "eh."
To an English speaker, this tone would sound like a statement of fact: "Huh."
A low-front vowel in the "ah" or "eh" families involves minimal effort, compared with a high vowel such as "ee" or a lip-rounder such as "oo."
Just as sharks and dolphins developed the same body plan to thrive in the water even though they\'re very different, all languages have developed a "Huh?"

The argument spilled into the spotlight in February and March, oddly because storms finally began hitting the state after a sunny, dry December and January.
Grober said the delta needed a good flushing to push out ocean salt from the dry months.
Pumping water out of the rivers to farms and cities did not greatly increase.
So how much water should flow to the ocean and how much should go into the south delta?
Last Friday, the state announced it would allow farmers and cities to take 5 percent of their allocation from the State Water Project.
The Bay Institute estimates 60 percent of the water from rain and snow is going to reservoirs, not into the delta.
In the delta, residents are extremely concerned about their communities as water cutbacks continue, said Janet McCleery, who lives in Discovery Bay, a community in the delta.
In Fresno County, drought and a zero allocation of Northern California river water will mean unemployment rates could climb to 50 percent in some towns, Sheriff Margaret Mims wrote to the water board.

Grober said the delta needed a good flushing to push out the salty ocean water from the dry months.
"That was the split in February and March."
"We\'re just trying to protect our home and life," she wrote, "and trying to save the salmon and local delta farmers while we\'re at it."
And how much should go into the south delta?
Mostly, the discussion is about river water allowed to reach the Pacific Ocean through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.
He is the assistant deputy director at the State Water Resources Control Board, which decides questions about California water rights.
But the storms in February and March caused the outflow of water to peak more than three times higher.

Finding records from the late 1800s to the 1930s is difficult, she said.
During that time, the U.S. government forcibly removed Indian children from their families.
The idea was to strip them of their Indian culture and "civilize" them.
"But if there is one thing we are, we are stubborn, which is the reason we are still here," Elliott said.

Even though the Kepler mission has found 3,601 possible planets, only 246 had been previously confirmed.
The new method researchers used to find and confirm these 715 planets relies on the idea that planets seem to cluster in systems with other planets.
It nearly quadruples the number of confirmed planets found with Kepler (from 246 to 961).
For example, many of these systems seem to have multiple planets clustered in an orbit smaller than Venus, or even Mercury, around our sun.
The number of Jupiter-sized worlds, on the other hand, increased by a mere 2 percent.
It will certainly have effects "for any mission that finds planets," Kepler project scientist Steve Howell said of the findings.
"I\'m super excited about this," said Sara Seager, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Yet before this happened the spacecraft turned up a trove of strange and wonderful worlds, researchers said \u2014 bringing them ever closer to finding "Earth 2.0."
The researchers have delivered "more than 20 times as many planets as have ever been found and announced at once," said Jack Lissauer.
Confirmed super-Earths (larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune) increased by 500 percent and Neptune-sized planets rose by 200 percent.
Instead Kepler might be picking up drops in light caused by two stars blocking each other.
It relies on the idea that planets seem to cluster in systems with other planets.
Two teams of researchers were able to devise a method that focused on these multiplanet systems.
This resulted in the largest single haul of exoplanets (planets found outside our solar system) since the first one was discovered in the 1990s.
Many exoplanets have also been discovered by looking for the gravitational influence of a planet on its star.
No similar planets are found in our own solar system.
Instead, Kepler might be picking up drops in light when two stars block each other.

Paleontologists have found fossils of a bizarre sea creature that are providing an important clue to how arthropods evolved.
"It is one of the biggest arthropods that ever existed, far bigger than any arthropod today," said Peter Van Roy.
Aegirocassis benmoulae is the latest of these animals to be found and is more than double the size of the biggest of its older known relatives.
He and the Moroccan fossil collector Mohamed Ben Moula, who first discovered them, have found dozens of preserved specimens in the Moroccan desert.
This ancient animal had a set of flaps that ran down the top side of its body for swimming, like an upper limb, and a set of legs on its belly side, for walking.
These include a variety of horseshoe crabs, some which look remarkably like modern-day horseshoe crabs, as well as jellyfish relatives, and early starfish and snails.
Long before the dinosaurs, a giant sea creature was one of the largest living beings on Earth.

Van Roy described how giant storms occasionally caused large mud flows to wash into the ancient sea.
The fossils were so well preserved scientists were able to solve a long-standing evolutionary mystery.
Paleontologists thought they could trace the leg of the modern arthropod to a much earlier arthropod from the early Cambrian period.

However, the growths on the sea creature just discovered were shaped differently.
Van Roy said the creatures may have come together to molt \u2014 shed their shells as they grew.
Soft tissues like skin and muscles decay quickly after death, explained John Paterson.

The pairing was indicative of the wildly successful union of what once were polar-opposite institutions: the stodgy, European-dominated IOC and the rebellious, U.S. extreme-sport community.
While the Olympics provide snowboarders and freestyle skiers with an international showcase, the new sports have added youthful energy and millions of new TV viewers to Games that were growing stale.
The Winter Games, as founder Baron de Coubertin conceived them and broadcast pioneer Roone Arledge presented them for so long, have been changed dramatically by the inclusion of these sports.
So is a younger TV audience that once spurned the Games.
Finally, in a burst of revised thinking between 1992 and 2010, the IOC added short-track speedskating and freestyle-skiing and snowboarding disciplines.
"At the same time, we have to remain relevant and make sure that we capture a new audience as well."
"They had little understanding of the sport," recalled Bodensteiner, "but we showed them how visually appealing it was and, maybe more importantly, how it could be picked up even in nations like Great Britain or Australia that don\'t have big mountains or big resorts."

Scientists have long noticed that tropical ecosystems are rich with different kinds of animal species.
Researchers compared eight species-rich mammalian orders.
The eight orders chosen for the study make up 92 percent of all mammals living on Earth.
The researchers explain that their vision of mammalian evolution on a large scale "continues to change drastically as new data is compiled and new methods are developed."
There are more than 4,000 different kinds of mammals.
They show that the tropics have been a source of different types of creatures in the cooler regions of the planet with little climate change.
Scientists have long noticed that tropical ecosystems are full of different kinds of animal species.

The study found that the two groups did an equal job at predicting how time was passing during the experiment.
But this may not be the whole explanation for the return trip effect.
In a 2011 study, psychologists asked a group of cyclists to bike to a fair.
Humans are advanced creatures, but we are not so good at measuring time.
Our sense of how much time is passing often depends on what is going on in our lives, what we are doing at a certain moment, or even on our mood.
When we go somewhere new it often seems that the trip back took less time than the trip to get there.
Some of the people in both groups were asked to tell the scientists every time they thought three minutes had passed.
The study suggests that the "return-trip effect" has something to do with memory and reflection.
When you are distracted by more interesting things, time passes quickly.
Scientists also have another theory.
On the way back, you recognize things you saw before and this makes the trip seem to go faster.
One study found that people can experience the effect even when they are in unfamiliar territory.
Then they split the group in half after they arrived.
One group rode home on the same road that they biked in on.
In the end, the "return trip effect" may be caused by all of these things.
Humans are great at many things but terrible at measuring time.
People in both groups were asked to tell the scientists every time they thought three minutes had passed.
The second group watched a man take two different trips.
The other group took a different way back, but it was exactly the same length as the first group.

Yet people do not experience the "return-trip effect" on trips they take often, like to work.
This is because they already know the route and have a good idea of how long the journey will take.

A group of astronomers say they have discovered an Earth-size planet where water could exist in liquid form.
But after finding the Earth-like planet known as Kepler-186f, it seems reasonable to assume "that other ones are likely to exist.
Scientists who were not involved in the study praised the find.
It sits some 490 light-years away in the group of stars called Cygnus, and circles its home star, Kepler-186, in just 130 days.
In the past, scientists have argued that M-dwarf stars may not be good places for life to develop around.
"I believe that planets are very" varied "and a whole range of them could be habitable," said astrophysicist Sara Seager.
Before it was hobbled last year by a broken gyroscope, the Kepler telescope stared at a patch of roughly 150,000 stars.
Close-in planets with shorter orbits complete their orbits more often, which makes them easier to find.
And given that M-dwarf stars account for 70 percent of the stars in the Milky Way, there could be billions of Earth-size planets throughout the galaxy.
"Whether we are an extremely rare fluke \u2014 a phenomenon that only happens once in a universe \u2014 or in a galaxy teeming with life is a very basic question," said planetary astrophysicist Dimitar Sasselov.
For "the first time in human history we have a good shot at answering that question, and that\'s very exciting."
The results are absolutely rock solid."
It circles its home star, Kepler-186, in just 130 days.
And given that M-dwarf stars account for 70 percent of the stars in the Milky Way, there could be billions of Earth-size planets throughout our galaxy.

"Whether we are an extremely rare fluke \u2014 a phenomenon that only happens once in a universe \u2014 or in a galaxy teeming with life is a very basic question," said astrophysicist Dimitar Sasselov.
Scientists say they have discovered an Earth-size planet that could have water on it.
But they said the huge discovery suggests that a large group of Earth-like planets is waiting to be found much closer to home.
But after finding the Earth-like planet known as Kepler-186f, it seems reasonable to guess "that other ones are likely to exist.
It will also mean that astronomers should be able to find plenty of similar planets closer to home.
Powerful telescopes in space will figure out which planets have the strongest signs of water and atmospheres that can support life.
The discovery marks a breakthrough in the search for planets that are not just Earth-size, but truly Earth-like.
Out of 1,800 or so confirmed planets, fewer than two dozen sit in a habitable zone.
None of the other planets are as close in size to Earth as Kepler-186f.
So even though Kepler-186f sits closer to its sun than Mercury does to our sun, it is still safely located in a habitable zone.
And given that M-dwarf stars account for 70 percent of the stars in the Milky Way, there could be billions of Earth-size planets throughout our galaxy.
"Whether we are an extremely rare fluke \u2014 a phenomenon that only happens once in a universe \u2014 or in a galaxy teeming with life is a very basic question," said astrophysicist Dimitar Sasselov.
For "the first time in human history we have a good shot at answering that question," he said.
Scientists say they have discovered an Earth-size planet that could have water on it.

Yet the minimum wage, one of their most important areas of disagreement, came up only in passing.
Raising the national minimum wage to $15 would more than double the amount that employers must pay their workers.

Most of the 370,000 children in Fukushima prefecture, or state, have been given ultrasound checkups since the meltdowns at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant.
The most recent statistics, released in August, show that thyroid cancer is suspected or confirmed in 137 of those children, compared to 112 a year earlier.
Elsewhere, the disease occurs in only about 1 or 2 of every million children per year by some estimates.
Looking harder with routine checkups, like the one in Fukushima, leads to quicker discovery of cancers, inflating the numbers in a so-called "screening effect."
Right after the disaster, the lead doctor brought in to Fukushima, Shunichi Yamashita, repeatedly ruled out the possibility of illnesses caused by radiation.
David J. Brenner, professor of radiation biophysics at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, took a different view.
He agreed that individual estimates on radiation doses are needed, but said that the higher thyroid cancer rate in Fukushima is "not due to screening.
The borders are constantly being changed as the cleanup of radiated debris and soil continues in an effort to bring as many people back as possible.
"Nonetheless, this study is critical to initiate additional investigations of possible health effects, for governmental planning, and increasing public awareness," Olshan said.

After four weeks of ferocious fighting, the guns of Gaza fell silent Tuesday with a 72-hour truce in place.
Though several previous cease-fires broke down in violence, some expressed cautious hopes that this might be the beginning of the end of the war.
Militants in Gaza sent a volley of 20 rockets toward Israel, with most of the rockets intercepted by the Iron Dome antimissile system or falling harmlessly.
One of the last of them struck a Palestinian home in Beit Sahour, near biblical Bethlehem in the West Bank.
Talks to be held in the Egyptian capital looked to be contentious.
Egypt, which controls access to southern Gaza through a crossing at Rafah, has a government hostile to Hamas.
The fighting has exacted a heavy toll: nearly 1,900 Palestinians reported dead, with the toll likely to rise when bodies are recovered from previously unreachable areas.
On July 17, it widened to a ground incursion in response to weeks of heavy rocket fire.
Israel has come under heavy international criticism for failing to take sufficient steps to protect civilians.
Israeli authorities have blamed other scattered attacks in Jerusalem this week on anger stemming from Palestinian deaths in Gaza.

When Rick Rodriguez Sr. moved into a three-bedroom home in Downey, California, in the mid-1980s, a neighbor interrupted his yard work with a question: "You\'re not going to be one of those guys that parks in the front yard and lets chickens run around in the front yard, are you?"
Now he is part of a wave of second- and third-generation Latino immigrants who have transformed Downey and numerous other Los Angeles suburbs, including Whittier, Pico Rivera, Van Nuys and Anaheim, over the last two decades.

Humans and other primates are more likely to "catch" a yawn when they are around those with whom they share "a close social bond."
They logged 254 hours of observation time over a five-month period, paying special attention to yawns.
Only yawns that occurred when wolves were awake, relaxed and not in distress were included in the study.
Nearby wolves were not counted if their eyes were closed at the time of the yawn.
If they did, they noted the gap in time between the first yawn and the follow-up yawn.
The scientists found that the wolves were indeed more likely to yawn after another wolf near them yawned.
Not only that, but among females, the closer the bond, the shorter the gap between the first and second yawn.
When someone yawns near you, you yawn too.

"It shows the Lebanese society to some extent catching up with the rest of the Arab world in terms of popular protests against the central government," said Rami Khouri.
These longstanding grievances erupted after the government closed its main landfill July 17, offering Beirut no alternative site to dump its trash.
Mountains of garbage piled up on the streets, prompting a protest movement that is calling itself "You Stink."
The "You Stink" movement, a rare, non-political grassroots movement, quickly picked up supporters and expanded its demands beyond just the trash in the street: It demanded the resignation of the entire government.
Lebanon has been without a president for more than a year, despite nearly 30 attempts by Parliament to pick a new one.
"We arrived in the morning and found everything broken, chairs on the floor, everything is a mess," said Joseph Khoury, who works at a car rental agency.
Some are already calling the huge protests of the past 2 days a revolt similar to those of the Arab Spring that overthrew dictators across the Mideast beginning in 2011.
Anticipating more trouble, the Lebanese army took up positions around downtown Beirut, stationing armored vehicles on street corners.
Activists, however, quickly dismissed those actions as political game-playing.

The tall, cool glass of milk with a sandwich at lunch or a burger at dinner is increasingly a thing of the past.
"It\'s really one of our best sources of vitamin D and calcium," said Deb Sheats, a nutrition professor at St. Catherine University in St. Paul.
Although added in the factory, plant milks have just as much, if not more, calcium and vitamin D as dairy milk, and sometimes fewer calories \u2014 though they are more expensive.

Sundquist made the switch after reading about the hormones given to cows.
Take the experience of Stacey Sundquist in Virginia, Minn. She and her husband have three kids under age 10.
Now, she drinks more water and has developed a taste for almond milk.
"I started questioning whether I needed cow\'s milk," she said.
The drop in milk drinking in 2011 and 2012 was the biggest in more than 10 years, though interest in milk has been falling for years.
People drank 25 percent less milk from 1975 through 2012, according to the federal government.
The tall, cool glass of milk with a sandwich at lunch or a burger at dinner may be a thing of the past.
Some people have been concerned about growth hormones used in dairy cows, business research company IBISWorld found.

But there is also a toe bone and a couple of tailbones from a second Siats.
!
The bones were found in a region of 100-million-year-old rocks in Utah.
"It\'s more than just a new dinosaur," Makovicky said.
The fully developed T. rex later ruled North America, until dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago.
Named Siats meekerorum, it was an important dinosaur before the time of Tyrannosaurus rex.
It was named after two things: a man-eating monster from the legends of the nearby Ute Indians, and the Meeker family who are big supporters of the museum.
More bones were turned up, including some from the backbone.
From there it was a matter of bringing the bones back to the lab.

Concern about substance abuse dates from at least the 19th century, when the Yakama signed the Treaty of 1855.
A lieutenant with the Yakama Nation tribal police force, Frederickson is one of the most skilled "spotters" in a task force aimed at getting rid of illegal pot statewide.
But each year the job has become more difficult, as growers with ties to Mexico go to greater lengths to hide their efforts.
Like most in and around the reservation, Frederickson said he opposed legalizing a substance he has worked so hard to get rid of.
"Alcohol has such an impact here," said Frederickson.
A tribal elder, she spent 20 years at the Youth Treatment Center here, counseling young men and women with substance abuse problems.
"You have to go out in the community, and you have to let people know," she said.

They got the name, right whales, because they were once considered the "right" whales to hunt.
They were able to spot 55 probable whales and 22 possible whales in the gulf as well as 13 whale-shapes underwater.
New satellites will have higher quality images and will allow scientists to identify whales with greater confidence, Fretwell and his coauthors write.
Scientists already have used satellite images to count populations of penguins in Antarctica and similar work was being done with seals.

In the Western world, it has been decades since worms were a familiar part of the human biome, the term for all organisms - or tiny life forms - that thrive in people.
"As far as the big picture of human health goes, it\'s pretty much already accepted that when you put helminths back into the ecosystem of the human body," you can stop disease, he said.
Although the use of helminths in humans is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there are about 7,000 people in the world using helminths for a variety of diseases.
Parker, who recently published a study on self-treatment with helminths, said those using worms to cure themselves fall into two groups.
"A lot of them are scientists, or are in the medical field; and the other half either knows one of those people or weren\'t that educated but got very, very sick" and educated themselves.
Depending on the species, helminths are given through a drink or are placed on a bandage applied to the skin, which absorbs them.
It will be some time before reports of helminthic success are backed by enough scientific data to win FDA approval.
The experiments are complicated by issues of where to get the worms, how many doses are needed, and how long treatment can take before showing results, Parker and Nandi said.
People considering self-treatment with helminths are advised to speak with their doctors.

"It\'s a great day when you can bring back a species from extinction," said Dunn, a technology consultant.
The torpedo-shaped trout with orange-red cheeks and sequined, rose-pink stripes that grows as large as salmon inhabited Pyramid Lake when it was part of a much larger body of water called Lake Lahontan tens of thousands of years ago.
From near extinction to stunning recovery, its comeback is a rare win for threatened and [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) made possible by the uncommon commitment of a fisheries biologist laboring in one of the most remote corners of the West.
Another reintroduction at Fallen Leaf Lake near Lake Tahoe in California in 2002 also is paying off: Last year, Lahontan cutthroats spawned there in a tributary for the first time in more than 70 years.

All of her previous achievements merely set the stage for 2013, when McFadden became the first person to win four major marathons \u2014 Boston, London, Chicago and New York \u2014 in the same calendar year.
McFadden had hatched her plan to try cross-country skiing \u2014 known as sit skiing in the Paralympics.
After she won the London Marathon in 2011, she decided to visit St. Petersburg before returning to the U.S. McFadden went back to Orphanage 13, taking in the modest space that had seemed so huge to her when she was a tiny kid, navigating the halls on her hands.
After touring the orphanage, she met her birth mother.
"They were absolutely amazed \u2014 from scrawny to how strong I\'ve become," McFadden says.
"Very few women in the world are as fit as she is," says her track coach, Adam Bleakney.
Some describe McFadden as having been "abandoned" in the orphanage, but she doesn\'t see things that way.
"My birth mom, she had to do the hardest part," Tatyana says.
She added, "Going back and showing her the person I\'ve become was almost a way of saying thank you to her.
She has remained in touch with Polivikova since their meeting, and looks forward to racing in front of her and various cousins in Sochi.
A little girl was dropped in a Russian orphanage.
Tatyana McFadden was once a little girl in Russia.
"\'You did what you could.

Instead of collecting pollen and nectar from flowers, robber bees raid the hives of other pollinators and steal their honey.
The sea slugs known as sacoglossans are some of the most remarkable biological burglars on the planet.
Most sea slugs digest the chloroplasts right away, but some species store them for weeks to months in large transparent digestive glands, turning the animals brilliant shades of green.
Sven Gould of the University of Dusseldorf and his team deprived six sacoglossans of food for 55 days: two enjoyed 12 hours of light followed by 12 hours of darkness each day; two lived with the same cycle, but received a drug that disrupted photosynthesis; and the remaining two slugs lived in continuous darkness.
Sunlight would not help them endure this subterranean slumber, but a digestive sac full of chloroplasts would do the trick.
Flamingos get their red and pink colors from the carotenoid proteins in the plankton they eat.
E. chlorotica, the emerald-green slug species Rumpho studies, seems to be so dependent on algae that if baby slugs are not exposed to it for at least seven days, they stop growing and die.
The chloroplasts E. chlorotica captures from its algae primarily make lipids, which provide a source of energy as well as building materials for cells.
If so, captive chloroplasts would be so much more than a postponed meal for the slugs \u2014 they would be more like a continually renewed vital organ.
Two were given 12 hours of light followed by 12 hours of darkness each day; two lived with the same cycle, but received a drug that prevented photosynthesis; and the remaining two slugs lived in continuous darkness.
They were all equally pale and all had lost about the same amount of weight.
"It\'s very appealing to think that here you have an animal slowly turning into plant," Gould said.
E. chlorotica seems to be so dependent on algae that if baby slugs are not exposed to it for at least seven days, they will stop growing and die.
Some ant species kidnap and enslave members of neighboring colonies.
Large frigate birds \u2014 also called pirate birds \u2014 swoop down on smaller seabirds and snatch the fish right out of their beaks.
They feed on simple underwater plants known as algae, which have no stems, roots or leaves, but which do contain green-colored chlorophyll.
Oxygen is produced as a result of photosynthesis.

Some sacoglossans hibernate in the winter, after burrowing into the bottom of the ocean floor.
Even if these slugs are not relying on photosynthesis for nutrition, they might be using some of the oxygen produced by the process.
Perhaps some of the slugs are camouflaging themselves \u2014 after all, they spend a lot of time sitting on green plants.
The slugs could be taking advantage of this to get a few weeks or months of free oxygen.
E. chlorotica seems to be so dependent on algae that if baby slugs are not exposed to it for at least seven days, they will stop growing and die.
What if E. chlorotica has handed over its lipid production to chloroplasts?

Julia took three years to create, and after consulting extensively with researchers, Westin was at first surprised that they recommended a girl.
As of now, Julia will not be appearing on the Sesame Street TV broadcast, a spokesman said.
The two groups that "see certain things differently, but what they had in common is they wanted to give families and children tools."
"We don\'t pretend that every child who is on the spectrum is the same," she said.
Yet the more she thought about it, the more it made sense to her.
Recently, Sesame Street Workshop unveiled its newest project, called "Sesame Street and Autism: See Amazing in All Children."
Sesame is trying to tackle a critical problem: Autistic children are five times as likely to be bullied than their peers.
For example, when she plays with a toy bus, "she especially likes spinning the wheels around and around."
However, Julia doesn\'t look in Abby\'s direction, prompting Abby to say, "Your friend doesn\'t like me."

When the authorship of a book or play is contested, computer-enhanced stylometry can compare suspected authors\' "signatures" to that of the disputed work.
In the end, two psychology professors from the University of Texas in Austin declared that the author of "Double Falsehood" \u2014 a tale of fathers, sons, duty and love \u2014 was Shakespeare.
He published the play in 1728, claiming it came from three original manuscripts written by the Bard.
"Our results offer consistent evidence against the notion that \'Double Falsehood\' is Theobold\'s whole-cloth forgery," Boyd and Pennebaker wrote.
While Theobold\'s "psychological signature" was not evident, it did make "passing statistical appearances" \u2014 probably the result of Theobold\'s practice of heavy editing, they added.
The researchers mentioned studies that show that the way writers use language, the words they choose, and even the length of their sentences shows their cognitive style and temperament.
A deep study of a writer\'s verbal output can "paint a very rich picture of who that person is, how he or she thinks, and what he or she thinks about," they wrote.
For Shakespeare, much of whose life remains a mystery, the study offers a bit of information: his frequent use of prepositions suggests he was very educated in grammar.
His heavy use of "social content words" (instead of words related to thinking or feeling) suggests he was more attentive to how people in society acted and was less concerned with the way people thought or felt, the authors wrote.
Those pieces, however, were said to have burned in a library fire.

In the end, two professors from the University of Texas in Austin declared that the author of "Double Falsehood" was Shakespeare.

For 300 years, people have been trying to decide who wrote a play called "Double Falsehood."
New research now says it is almost certainly the work of Shakespeare.
It also shows he cared more about how people in society acted than the way they thought or felt, the authors wrote.

They had computers go through millions of sentences of text.
Instead, scholars became suspicious that Theobold was only pretending that the play was written by Shakespeare.

It also shows he cared more about how people in society acted than the way they thought or felt, the authors wrote.
There were 33 by Shakespeare, nine by Fletcher and 12 by Theobold.
Boyd and Pennebaker said the study showed proof that the work was not a fake by Theobold.
Theobold claimed it came from three pieces written by hand by William Shakespeare.
There was no proof that Shakespeare wrote the play.
It can also be used to help us better understand who a person was and how they thought, they said.
Israeli troops battled Hamas militants on Wednesday near a southern Gaza Strip town in fighting that has so far killed more than 680 Palestinians and 34 Israelis.
Israel has insisted it must substantially curb the military capabilities of the Islamic militant group Hamas \u2014 a position that appears to have gained support within the U.S. administration.
On the ground, meanwhile, Israeli troops backed by tanks and aerial drones clashed with Hamas fighters armed with rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles on the outskirts of Khan Younis.
An airstrike demolished a home, killing 30-year-old journalist Abdul Rahman Abu Hean, his grandfather Hassan and his nephew Osama.
"I spoke with him a day and a half ago," his mother, Evie Steinberg, told Israeli TV.
Israel says it launched the Gaza operation to halt Hamas rocket fire into Israel \u2014 more than 2,100 have been fired since the conflict erupted.
She noted an Israeli drone strike that killed three children and wounded two others while they were playing on the roof of their home.
"These are just a few examples where there seems to be a strong possibility that international humanitarian law has been violated, in a manner that could amount to war crimes," Pillay told the 47-nation U.N. Human Rights Council.
As the Gaza death toll mounted, a 34-year-old Palestinian man was killed in clashes with Israeli soldiers near the West Bank City of Bethlehem, doctors said.
Hundreds of residents of eastern Khan Younis were seen fleeing their homes as the battle unfolded, flooding into the streets with any belongings they could carry.
Meanwhile, a foreign worker in Israel was killed when a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed in southern Israel on Wednesday, police said.
In Jerusalem, 30,000 people attended the funeral of Max Steinberg, a 24-year-old from Southern California serving in the Israeli military.
Israeli troops battled Hamas militants on Wednesday near a southern Gaza Strip town in continuing fighting.
Steinberg was killed in an attack on Sunday.
The Palestinian death toll stands at 684, mostly civilians, said Gaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra.

Porter the dog is trying to figure out why his owner has placed a toy bone under a bucket.
"And they might have been shaped in a way that\'s very different from any other animal species in part because, in a sense, they behave more like a human child who\'s cued in (to humans) than, say, a chimpanzee."
"More and more, we\'re learning that, although monkeys" are "closely related to us, the environment they\'re in and the way they\'re raised is completely different," she said.
"They grow up in exactly the same environments as children and rely on some of the same kinds of cues," she said.
Porter the dog is trying to figure something out: Why has his owner placed a toy bone under a bucket?
For all that we ask of dogs \u2014 loyalty, companionship, slipper-fetching \u2014 rarely have we asked how dogs think.
Monkeys have to be housed somewhere.
The Canine Cognition Center is the latest example of that growing interest in dogs.
While monkeys are "closely related to us, the environment they\'re in and the way they\'re raised is completely different," she said.
Monkeys and other animal subjects have to be housed somewhere \u2014 but at the Canine Cognition Center, people bring in their dogs for tests and then bring them home.
His studies found that dogs learn to associate humans with food.
Dog behavior studies peaked in the 1960s, but declined over the rest of the 20th century.
Now in the 21st century, dog studies are picking up again.
The difference between recent studies of dogs and earlier ones are the reasons behind the studies.
"I think recently, that animals \u2014 dogs and cats \u2014 are seen more as persons in our home," said dog researcher Erica Feuerbacher.
Porter is growing up in the same kind of setting as human children, Santos said.
For that reason, comparing how he learns with the way people learn can tell us a lot about how humans develop.

Dogs have "all sorts of jobs in the real world," he said.
She also looks at how dogs react to cues, or signals, from the humans around them.
They "rely on some of the same kinds of cues."
Santos said she has about 300 dogs signed up.
These include serving as guide dogs and sniffing for bombs and drugs.
Dogs are even used to sniff out diseases like cancer.
The new studies will help us pick "the best dogs for those jobs."
The Los Angeles City Council lifted a decade-long ban on public murals.
They will now be able to "reclaim our legacy as a mural capital of the world," said Isabel Rojas-Williams, executive director of the Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles.
Advertisers sued the city on First Amendment grounds, arguing that it was unfair that artists could create big, eye-catching murals when they were banned for commercial enterprises.
Not all murals were treated equally in what artists call the "dark ages" of the ban.
But when pop star Chris Brown put up 8-foot-high fanged creatures on a retaining wall at his Hollywood Hills home, neighbors deluged City Hall with complaints.
In addition to concerns about the murals\' appearance, residents worry that they will attract graffiti and become "God-awful eyesores," he said.
We should recognize that."

Following the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy, officials all over the country are trying to figure out the best way to keep schools safe.
Last week, Sheriff Arpaio put his own new school safety plan into action.
He sent out his volunteer posse to patrol 59 schools in Maricopa County.
She said school officials do not necessarily oppose the new plan, but that there are details that schools need to consider.
The plan has its critics.
The sheriff says that publicity about the program will help prevent violent criminals from entering schools.
The move by Sheriff Arpaio comes in a highly charged political climate.
The White House called the NRA video "repugnant and cowardly."
Their school has no armed guards on staff.
The posse includes some former police officers.
Their school has no armed guards of its own.
He calls himself "the toughest sheriff in America."
They are not inside the schools or on school property.
"This will be mainly a deterrent, prevention, that\'s why we\'re sending marked cars out there," Sheriff Arpaio told J. J. Hensely of The Arizona Republic.
"I can\'t imagine criticism coming when they\'re given free protection."
Sheriff Joe Arpaio calls himself "the toughest sheriff in America."
After the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy, officials all over the country wanted to find out the best way to keep schools safe.
Sheriff Arpaio did not need extra money for the program because posse members do not get paid for working.
Joe Arpaio is a county sheriff in Arizona.', u'He calls himself "the toughest sheriff in America."
The White House called the NRA video "cowardly."
Some of the volunteers carry weapons with them while they are on patrol.
"This will be mainly a deterrent, prevention, that\'s why we\'re sending marked cars out there," Sheriff Arpaio told J. J. Hensely of The Arizona Republic.
President Obama wants to convince the public to support his plan.
It would make it harder for people to buy guns.
The National Rifle Association (NRA) is against these measures.
That compares to 14 percent of toddlers and 13 percent of Americans overall.
A total of 7,443 children between the ages of 2 and 11 and 6,447 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 19 took part in the new study.
Compared with the earlier period, the more recent figures were 25 percent lower for younger children, according to the study.
The decline in pizza eating was seen mainly in younger children who are white or African-American, bringing them closer to the consumption levels of Latino children.
By the end of the study period, the amount of pizza eaten for dinner was similar to the amount eaten for lunch.
Pizza "should become a target for counseling for the prevention and treatment of obesity" by children\'s doctors, they said.
The death toll from a massive earthquake in southwestern Pakistan rose sharply to nearly 300 on Wednesday, officials and local media said.
Crisis teams braced for more deaths and rescue workers raced to reach isolated mountain communities.
Initial reports had placed the magnitude at 7.8.
"Right now, as I talk to you, I\'m sitting on a rock beside the ruins," the teacher said, adding that no government rescue workers had arrived yet.
A spokesman for the Baluchistan government said its offices were sending 1,000 tents, 500 food bags, various types of medicine and a dozen ambulances to Awaran.
Gwadar, a port city located about 200 miles southwest of Awaran in the Arabian Sea, saw one of the more unusual characteristics of the earthquake: the near-spontaneous creation of an island a few hundred yards off the coast.

That year, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake killed more than 74,000 people.
A large earthquake hit southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday.
Most houses in the region are poorly constructed of simple materials.
First guesses were that the island was about 30 feet high and 100 feet long.
"If it is just mud, it\'s possible it will disappear soon," said Zahid Raf of Pakistan\'s National Seismic Monitoring Center.
If there\'s a rock beneath it, or it appeared because of the movement of a big rock, then it may stay."
It killed more than 74,000 people.

"The bottom line is people need to decide whether they\'d rather import their labor or import their food," said Randall Patterson, a North Carolina farmer who grows strawberries, cucumbers and watermelons.
The 52-year-old third-generation farmer legally employs about 140 foreign-born workers on his 1,200-acre farm through a system similar to the one a group of senators wants to streamline.
Many of their former workers no longer show up because they fear being stopped by police on their way to the fields and deported.
Many Republicans and Democrats agree that the industry is suffering because of a broken immigration system that has workers living in the shadows.
Many of those on the right oppose providing any legal path for those here illegally, and many of those on the left argue that the farm labor must be addressed only as part of a wider plan.

They would be granted special legal status.
The bill also calls for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to hand out guest worker visas, rather than the Department of Labor, to ensure a sufficient workforce.
Yet, there are few U.S.-born farm workers in the fields.
More than 90 percent of those applying were hired, but just 163 showed up for the first day of work.

The fruits and vegetables you find in your neighborhood grocery store today are just as likely to be picked in Mexico and Brazil as in California and Florida.
"The bottom line is people need to decide whether they\'d rather import their labor or import their food," said Randall Patterson, a North Carolina fruit farmer.
"If that labor was not available to us," Conner said, "... it would mean that we would get that food from somewhere else."

But crops are being left to rot in fields across the country because farmers cannot find enough workers.
They could even become U.S. citizens.
"If that labor was not available to us," Conner said, "... it would mean that we would get that food from somewhere else."
He said 80,000 acres worth of fresh fruits and vegetables that had been grown in California are now grown outside the United States because of labor shortages.
A new study found that just 268 U.S.-born people in North Carolina applied for farm jobs.
There are nearly 500,000 people without jobs in the state.

Still, he said, he has been meeting with lawmakers "around the clock" to address concerns that it would allow businesses to deny services to gay customers.
Although the legal language does not specifically mention gays and lesbians, critics say the law is designed to protect businesses and individuals who do not want to serve gays and lesbians.
Also Tuesday, the Indianapolis Star urged Indiana lawmakers to respond to widespread criticism of the law by protecting the rights of gays and lesbians.
The newspaper says the uproar sparked by the law has "done enormous harm" to the state.
Hundreds of protesters filled the Arkansas Capitol to oppose the measure, holding signs that read "Discrimination is not a Christian Value" and "Discrimination is a Disease."
"I believe that many people will want to flee the state, and many people will want to avoid our state," said Rita Jernigan.

At one time, the Marine Corps did not encourage their soldiers to have families.
That considerate approach reflects a growing theme in the military: provide for the families as well as the warriors.

China has promised to stop selling and processing ivory.
On May 29, China destroyed nearly 1,500 pounds of poached ivory in a public ceremony.
China bought 62 tons of ivory from Africa in 2008, and then imported it in 2009.
Meng said the Chinese government is selling five tons of ivory a year to carving workshops but would "gradually" reduce that amount to zero.
More than 20,000 animals are thought to have been killed for their tusks in each of the past two years.
Meng said attitudes toward conservation are changing throughout China, particularly among younger people.
Trophy hunters can also import ivory into the United States as long as they do not sell it.
New York and New Jersey both passed laws outlawing it, but the United States has not completely banned it.
The National Rifle Association still supports trophy hunting and the sale of guns with ivory handles.
As campaigns officer at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, LaFontaine has written that the U.S. must lead by example.

Parents hoping to avoid a wait for a visit with Santa Claus at Woodfield Mall near Chicago can now reserve a spot in line with the jolly fellow, though it will cost them.
The new fee and elaborate home for Santa are part of a trend across the country to make holiday displays grander at shopping centers.
Holiday displays are "on the scale of what we are calling an attraction now," said Ruth Rosenquist, a spokeswoman for Noerr Programs, which sends Santas and photographers to 278 malls across the United States, including Woodfield.
"I really believe that it\'s a result of online shopping and the fact that developers are now realizing that Santa Claus is a physical manifestation of the holidays," she said.
Malls in the Chicago area typically allow free visits with Santa but charge fees for photos and do not let parents take pictures, operators say.
Mary Jo Shepherd, a parent who has brought her kids to Woodfield for years, considers the advance fee "a new level of greed."
She considers Christmas exhibits at malls and stores, like the holiday window displays at Macy\'s in downtown Chicago, to be a "give-back" to customers, and was appalled a few years ago when Woodfield stopped letting parents take their own pictures during Santa visits.
But Matthew Caczewe, a father of two girls, said he works in sales and understands why malls might have to charge for bigger exhibits.
John Sullivan, who once managed Santa mall exhibits and now portrays Santa at a variety of events, maintains a long list of free events on his website, at www.santainchicago.com Most cities, villages, park districts and chambers of commerce offer free visits with Santa and let parents take their own pictures, he said.
It has teamed up with DreamWorks Animation to create "Adventure to Santa," a 20-minute movie that leads visitors on an interactive journey to find Santa, with help from Shrek, Donkey and their friends.
"When things become too big or too grand or too monetized, there\'s a nice pendulum shift back," he said.

"My hope was that the Chicago project would create some awareness around the homeless," said Ian Todd, the artist responsible for the signs.
"It was a bit shocking seeing all the homelessness," Todd said.
Some refused, but others agreed and Todd got to work.
The signs tell many stories of struggle, from a single father trying to support three children to a woman offering work so she can afford a bus ticket home.
Droney said he often gets compliments about the sign, but it is hard to tell whether the lettering is really doing much.
In 2011, the Chicago Tribune newspaper did a piece on a man named Christopher Devine who was printing and laminating signs for the homeless.
They were printed on white paper in bold Helvetica font with text saying "Homeless" or "Please Help."
He told his homeless friends before he left that he would no longer be able to make signs for them.
Clues to what our ancestors ate, how they got along and what diseases they fought may be found in their teeth.
"I feel like we discovered a time capsule that has been right under our noses this whole time," said Christina Warinner.
Plaque is the rough, bumpy stuff you might notice coating your teeth if you have skipped too many dentist appointments.
Today, dentists scrape plaque off our teeth as part of our regular teeth cleanings.
To find out, she scraped the fossilized plaque off the teeth of four skeletons from Dalheim, Germany.
After treating the plaque with various chemicals, she put them through a machine that separates out the DNA.
"When we analyzed the (plaque) we got 100 to 1,000 times more DNA fragments than we would have from a bone."
So this method could be used to learn more about people from a wide range of time periods.
Clues about how our ancestors lived may be found in their teeth.
The challenge is how to (find) it."
Warinner wanted to know whether it had also preserved DNA.
"What is exciting is it looks like the way (plaque) protects the DNA \u2014 almost like it is sealed in concrete \u2014 so it is more protected," she said.
Clues about how people lived can be found in their teeth.
Clues about how our ancestors lived may be found in their teeth.
But now, it is clear that plaque holds a huge amount of information.
They hoped to find tiny bits of food stuck in its hard material.
The skeletons were from people who lived about 1000 years ago.
From those tiny pieces of DNA, Warinner and an international team of scientists determined that bacteria in tooth disease has not changed much in 1,000 years.
This provides evidence of what people ate 1,000 years ago.
This includes scientists who study the germs that cause lung diseases and ones who look at how tooth and gum diseases have changed over time.
Warinner notes that all groups of people who ever lived have had plaque on their teeth.

They also found bits of plant DNA in the teeth.

On April 30, Obama promised that he will go back to the Guantanamo problem, which frustrated him during his first term.
A: According to a report by researchers at the Constitution Project, Pentagon officials considered a variety of Pacific islands and other remote locations for holding men captured during the so-called war on terrorism that President George W. Bush declared after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on U.S. soil.
The most secret of the facilities, Camp 7, holds an estimated 15 of the detainees, including those accused of planning the 9/11 attacks.
Although Cuba owns the Guantanamo land, the Supreme Court noted, the United States has exercised complete control for more than 100 years.
The Bush and Obama administrations also have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade the facility.
A: This is a hotly debated topic.
Three of the 166 have been convicted of crimes by a military court, seven have been charged with crimes - including the five accused of planning in the 9/11 attacks - and 24 may face criminal charges.
Until recently, most of the detainees were in Camp 6, where they were allowed to keep their cell doors open and move freely, watch television and eat together.
The most secret part of Guantanamo, Camp 7, holds about 15 of the detainees, including those accused of planning the 9/11 attacks.
A: Since 2009, Congress has made it difficult for the White House to transfer men out of Guantanamo.
Another 72 were suspected of fighting against U.S. forces.
SHINGTON \u2013 Barack Obama promised to close Guantanamo Bay when he ran for president.
A: When the first detainees arrived, they were housed in wire pens that looked like a backyard dog kennel.

A: The first detainees were housed in wire pens that looked like a backyard dog kennel.
A: Since 2009, Congress has made it hard for Obama to move men out of Guantanamo.
Officials eventually turned to Guantanamo, which had been used to house people from Haiti and Cuba who had been picked up on the high seas trying to reach the United States.
Also, since it is part of Cuba, the men held there would not be able to take their case to U.S. courts.
Three of the 166 have been convicted of crimes by a military court, seven have been charged with crimes - including the five accused of planning in the 9/11 attacks - and 24 may face criminal charges.
Also, 46 face no criminal charges but they were found to be too dangerous to release.
The most secret part of Guantanamo, Camp 7, holds about 15 of the detainees, including those accused of planning the 9/11 attacks.
The Supreme Court ruled in a 2008 decision that Guantanamo detainees had the same constitutional right to get their day in court as prisoners in the United States.
The justices decided that meant it was really part of the United States.
That works out to about $800,00 per prisoner.
SHINGTON \u2013 Barack Obama promised to close Guantanamo Bay when he ran for president.
A: The military says it uses the term for most of the men because they have not been found guilty of crimes.

So guards forced all the prisoners back into small cells.
One law stops him from using military money to move detainees to the United States.
A: The military looked at many faraway places for holding men caught after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
Officials thought that the men held there would not be able to take their cases to U.S. courts.
The Supreme Court said that was not fair.
But they are thought to be too dangerous to release.

It also stops him from moving detainees to risky countries where it might be hard to keep track of them.

The report said that 97 went back to fighting against U.S. forces.

Lots and lots of cats.
TNR, they say, prolongs the suffering of the cats, who can fall victim to cars, predators, disease and human cruelty.
The issue is highly emotional and potentially explosive, with arguments on both sides dismissed by each other as "misinformation" and "propaganda."
The Orange County Animal Services department partners with CARE Feline TNR and provides hundreds of free spay-and-neuter surgeries to the organization.
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) has information on its website about risks to health and wildlife posed by cats.
A major line of attack against the practice is the claim that cats kill huge numbers of birds and other wildlife.
Alley Cat Allies, a national advocacy group, has been lobbying on behalf of TNR efforts since its founding in 1990.
The organization counters that human activity has a much greater impact on bird populations than predation by cats.
She argues that the anti-TNR position "assumes we have a choice between cats and no cats.
"It\'s not as if you stop putting out bowls of food and the cats will go away," Holtz added.
"The larger issue is that trapping and killing has not worked," said Elizabeth Holtz of Alley Cat Allies.
She added, "It\'s not as if you stop putting out bowls of food and the cats will go away.
"In most situations it is cruel to both the cats and local wildlife," said Teresa Chagrin of PETA.
"It\'s never going to go away," she said, looking out over her cats in the twilight.
"If people weren\'t putting out food, they would just go through the trash."

Terise Marchelos pulled into a downtown parking lot.
About 20 of the animals greet her each evening when she arrives in a parking lot in downtown Orlando.
Such cats, they argue, can fall victim to cars, coyotes, disease and cruel humans.
Williams argued this was necessary in order to protect wild birds.
Outraged cat lovers protested, and he eventually apologized.
One study found that cats kill up to 3.7 billion birds a year.
"It\'s not as if you stop putting out bowls of food and the cats will go away," Holtz added.
The animal-rights group PETA is against TNR, however.
Chagrin thinks feral cats should be put to sleep.
"It\'s never going to go away," she said, looking out over her cats.
TNR works like this: People trap cats, then take them to a vet.
About 35,000 walrus were photographed Saturday about 5 miles north of Point Lay.
They also use ice as a diving platform to reach snails, clams and worms on the shallow continental shelf.
As temperatures warm in summer, the edge of the sea ice gets pushed further north.
In 2011, scientists estimated there were 30,000 walrus along 1 kilometer of beach near Point Lay.
As a result, record numbers of walrus are coming to a beach in Alaska.
They also use ice as a diving platform to reach clams and snails and worms on the shallow continental shelf.
Large groups of walrus were first spotted on the U.S. side of the Chukchi Sea in 2007.
Stampedes can be set off by a polar bear, human hunter or low-flying airplane.
It said walrus have also been gathering in large groups on the Russian side of the Chukchi Sea.
Officials were putting together a team to find out how they died.
Walrus use their tusks to pull themselves onto ice or rocks.

They can do the same thing to X-rays and defibrillators, which give a shock to the heart.
SANS is a private company that specializes in Internet protection training.
In 2007, he had the wireless function on his heart defibrillator disabled.
If they did that, it would stop "somebody from doing something bad," he said.
Wired magazine published a report in April.
They can even change temperature settings on refrigerators that store drugs and blood.
"Both of the people I talked to had no idea this was possible," he said.
X-rays and defibrillators \u2013 which regulate the heart \u2013 are also linked up.

He said it was hard to say how big the risk of medical information leaks was.
For Americans, Chinese New Year brings to mind colorful parades and fireworks in Chinatowns across the United States.
Hundreds of millions have moved from rural areas to cities in recent years.
Earlier this month, a Chinese woman in Guangdong province was so upset over her long-lost son that she purchased a front-page ad in the Chinese Melbourne Daily.
They moved to Beijing to take factory or office jobs, often living in run-down and crowded conditions.
When she was asked for her name and details, she got nervous and walked away.
The money could help migrants return home for Spring Festival.
Pressure on stingy and crooked bosses had recovered $1.8 billion in unpaid wages for more than 1.5 million workers across the country, according to the Chinese government.

To slow down the spread of the deadly virus Ebola, the United States and Britain are sending troops and equipment to West Africa.
The military forces will build treatment centers in Liberia and Sierra Leone to help care for victims of the virus.
"When patients are turned away at Ebola treatment centers, they have no choice but to return to their communities and homes," the WHO said.
In Liberia alone, about 152 health care workers have come down with the virus.
In contrast, the U.S. has 250 doctors for every 100,000 people, according to the World Bank.
In neighboring Sierra Leone, a WHO doctor who was working at one Ebola center tested positive for the virus.
President Barack Obama said that the U.S. military will help set up isolation units and equipment for health workers.

On Wednesday morning, General Mills, the biggest seller of cereal in the United States, announced that sales have slipped again, marking the sixth straight time the company has reported lower sales.
Other cereals, such as the once-popular brand Wheaties, have not fared so well over time.
Last year, sales of Wheaties dipped to $17 million, marking at least the 10th consecutive year in which people bought fewer boxes of the whole-grain flakes.
Over the past decade, several shifts have taken place in the cereal world.
Kashi, too, has posted considerable growth since the mid-2000s, although it has struggled of late.
Wheaties has seen sales drop by nearly 80 percent over the past 10 years.
!
Overall, cereal sales are down 6 percent since their peak in 2009, and they are expected to continue falling through at least 2019.
Muesli, the strongest of the bunch, has been the only type of cereal to post steady growth.
Rice Krispies sales have fallen 32 percent.
Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Lucky Charms remain popular too.

On Wednesday morning, the company announced that its cereal sales have slipped again, marking the sixth straight time it has reported lower sales.
Cereal is just no longer the centerpiece of breakfast it once was.

The scene shown in so many cereal commercials \u2014 families gathered around a dining table, each person with a bowl of cereal \u2014 is just not as common as it used to be.
General Mills sold nearly $1 billion worth of the cereal last year.

This year marks the 100th anniversary of the massacre of more than 1 million Armenians at the hands of Ottoman Turks.
White House officials defended the decision, saying it was necessary to preserve the chance of cooperation with Turkey on Middle Eastern conflicts.
National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan released a statement saying the United States would use the anniversary of the onset of the massacres to "urge a full, frank and just acknowledgment of the facts that we believe is in the interest of all parties."
However, the official added, "the approach we have taken in previous years remains the right one \u2014 both for acknowledging the past, and for our ability to work with regional partners to save lives in the present."
Turkish officials base their argument that the killings do not meet the definition of genocide on the claim that no intentional plan to eliminate Armenian populations was involved.
This year marks the 100th anniversary of the mass killing of more than 1 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks.
"The president\'s surrender represents a national disgrace," said Aram S. Hamparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America.
In a statement, Speier said, "I intend to call it what it was \u2014 I will call it a genocide everywhere I go."
Roughly 1.5 million Armenians were killed starting in 1915 during the chaotic collapse of the Ottoman Empire.
Beginning in 1915, Ottoman Turks killed more than 1 million of the Armenians then living within the Ottoman Empire.
"The president\'s surrender represents a national disgrace," said Aram S. Hamparian, head of the Armenian National Committee of America.
Speier said: "I intend to call it what it was \u2014 I will call it a genocide everywhere I go."
Most historians, however, believe the use of the word is appropriate.

In a rare Oval Office address Sunday night, President Barack Obama sought to reassure Americans shaken by recent attacks in Paris and California.
"I know that after so much war, many Americans are asking whether we are confronted by a cancer that has no immediate cure," he said, speaking from his West Wing office.
Authorities say a married couple carried out the attack, and that the wife pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in a Facebook post.
He announced no significant shift in U.S. strategy or new policy solutions for defeating the Islamic State, showing both his confidence in his current approach and the lack of easy options for countering the extremist group.
Still, he called on Muslims in the United States and around the world to fight extremism.
Obama stands little chance of getting the Republican-led Congress to agree to any gun control law.

"If somebody tells me today that another deportation is possible, I would tell him that he is an idiot and nothing of the kind can happen again," said Jafer Abdulkerimov.
Repression and deportation followed, and over the next half century, more than 600,000 Tatars were forced to leave, Abdulayeva said.
On May 18, 1944, Jafer, his two brothers and his mother were awakened at 5 a.m., along with hundreds of other Tatar families in his village.
Huddled below deck, the deportees saw daylight only when a door was opened to dump a dead woman overboard.
"Women and children were crying and wailing while old men were praying," Abdulkerimov said.
In December, Aksenov reportedly led a group of Russian nationalists who rioted through an area on the outskirts of Simferopol, where dozens of Crimean Tatars were building homes.
The attackers destroyed many of the buildings with sledgehammers and crowbars, Dzhemilev said.
"The Tatars should watch their step now," said Alexander Zhilkin, who carried a Russian national flag to protest the presence of the Ukrainian army.
"When they deported my father\'s and mother\'s families in 1944, all our grown men were at the front and couldn\'t protect them," said Emir Shevkiev, a member of the local Tatar community.

State lawmakers around the United States are taking a harder line on crimes that were once seen as juvenile pranks.
Recently, though, there have been proposals across the United States to increase punishments, said Michael Dorn, executive director of the school safety nonprofit group Safe Havens International.
His son was caught up in a 3 1/2-hour lockdown at his high school in October after a threat that came in by telephone.
"As we were kids growing up \u2014 I\'m 51 \u2014 we always had the notion that it was a childish prank," Hwang said.
An analysis by National School Safety and Security Services found a 158 percent increase in the number of threats schools received in a five-month span in 2014 compared with the same period the previous year.
About 37 percent of the threats were sent electronically, and nearly one-third resulted in schools being evacuated.
These include Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Virginia and Washington, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
A bill passed by the California Legislature would have created a specific crime for someone who threatens to discharge a firearm on a school campus.
Dorn said school threats are a popular tactic for people who want to cause major disruptions.

But on some days, scientists are catching and releasing as many as 30 sharks in one hour in the shallow waters at the southern edges of the bay, Hobbs said.
Scientists could catch the sharks and cut them open to study what the sharks eat when they swim into the old salt ponds.
Most of the areas opened are less than 10 feet deep, so during low tides vast areas of mud flats are exposed.
"We\'re starting to see a lot more leopard sharks and also bat rays in the ponds now," said Eric Mruz, manager of the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge.
"It\'s pretty much a buffet tray for them," said Jim Hobbs, a biologist who is helping lead the research in areas along the bay.
Before 2003, leopard sharks that wanted to eat from those shallow waters had to swim to the middle of the bay every low tide to avoid being washed ashore.
"We\'re starting to see a lot more leopard sharks, and also bat rays in the ponds now," said Eric Mruz, a manager of San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge.

Studies have linked vision and literacy, Hopkins researchers say, but there has never been a big study on children with conclusions drawn from their reading performance in the classroom.
So far, the results have been staggering \u2014 of the 250 students tested between January and March, 150 needed glasses.
The city also has a history of problems when it comes to ensuring that students are screened and treated properly.
In the last school year, she said, the department increased its vision screening rate to 96 percent.
Fewer than 20 percent of students who test positive for vision problems end up getting glasses, she said.
Wen said lack of vision care is a "big problem" among city students, adding to educational barriers like truancy and drop-out rates.
The health department is looking at new ways to get glasses to students, such as mobile eye clinics.
The study includes second- and third-grade students, who are at a critical time in their education.

Now the archaeologist is back in the spotlight with another set of prehistoric bones, along with DNA evidence that helps resolve a long-standing puzzle about the first Americans.
Divers came across a trove of prehistoric animal bones and one of the oldest, most complete human skeletons in the Western Hemisphere.
That jibes with genetic studies documenting their descent from Siberians believed to have migrated east into the land mass that once linked Asia and Alaska.
The study is the first to show that there is at least one Paleo-American who is descended from the same ancestors as modern Native Americans, said WSU anthropologist Brian Kemp.
Alberto Nava, one of the divers who discovered the skeleton in 2007, said he and his team swam through a mile-long tunnel before reaching a chamber the size of a basketball arena.
Heaps of bones on the chamber floor, nearly 150 feet below sea level, were identified later as those of sabertooth cats, elephant-like creatures called gomphotheres and giant sloths.

Jim Chatters tried to keep his head down.
They said the human remains are those of a teenage girl.
Both skeletons have narrow brain cases, short faces and large foreheads.
First came people from Southeast Asia or even Europe, then migrants from Siberia.
The girl probably fell through a hole into the chamber.
Jim Chatters was the first scientist to study the Kennewick Man.
Naia will help scientists argue that most of the people who came to the Americas had their roots in northeast Asia.
The young girl probably fell through a hole into the chamber.
The old bones got Chatters in a bitter fight.
The new discovery comes from an underwater cave in Mexico.
It is one of the oldest, most complete human skeletons in the Americas.
She apparently fell into the limestone cave between 12,000 and 13,000 years ago.
The divers who found the skeleton named her "Naia."
The first Americans are believed to have moved east into the land mass that once linked Asia and Alaska.
First came people from Southeast Asia or even Europe, they said.
It proves there is at least one Paleo-American \u2014 Naia \u2014 who came from the same ancestors as modern Native Americans.
Ebola outbreaks in the past few decades have consistently "burned out" in relatively isolated and rural areas in Central Africa.
Projections from the WHO and the CDC suggest that the death toll could soon climb to the tens of thousands if efforts to contain the epidemic are not substantially increased.
The massive scale-up in resources provided by international forces could lessen the effects of the disease.
Yet the longer the response takes, the greater the possibility that areas that are now Ebola-free or that become Ebola-free could flare up again.
Already Senegal and Nigeria appear to have stopped the spread of Ebola.
They suggest the reproductive rate has not changed much between those historical cases and this epidemic in West Africa.

Without new people to make sick, the virus eventually had nowhere to go.
Right now every ill patient with Ebola during this outbreak typically makes about two more people sick.
In the 1918 Spanish flu that killed more than 30 million people worldwide, each ill person infected between two and five people, says Gerardo Chowell of Arizona State University.
"We can\'t make the risk zero until the outbreak is controlled in West Africa," says Tom Frieden, head of the CDC.
Past outbreaks of Ebola happened in areas of Central Africa that are difficult to reach.
Right now every ill patient with Ebola makes about two more people sick.
In a worst-case scenario, Sierra Leone and Liberia alone could have up to 1.4 million cases by mid-January, the CDC said.

During his first term, President Obama rarely brought up the issue of race.
"So often, the issues facing boys and young men of color get caught up in long-running ideological arguments \u2014 about race and class and crime and poverty, the role of government," the president said to a packed White House room.
Obama on Thursday signed a presidential memorandum setting up a task force to figure out which public and private efforts are working, and how to expand upon them.
Several foundation leaders joined Obama to announce plans to invest at least $200 million over the next five years.
The president has seen the results already in his meetings with the Becoming a Man group from Hyde Park Academy.
"I think the president\'s getting as much out of this as they are," said Anthony Ramirez-Di Vittorio, a social worker who runs the program.

Obama only occasionally spoke about race in his first term.
"I think the president\'s getting as much out of this as they are," said Anthony Ramirez-Di Vittorio, a social worker who founded and runs the program.
A year ago, Obama sat down with a dozen young men for their weekly "check-in circle" at their school.
During his first term, President Obama rarely talked about race.
"I felt the flame in me," he said.
Last summer, he invited them to his own circle: the Oval Office.
On Thursday, however, he unveiled a program aimed at helping a group he says demands urgent attention: black and Latino young men.
"So often, the issues facing boys and young men of color get caught up in long-running ideological arguments \u2014 about race and class and crime and poverty, the role of government," the president said.

The incident east of Freetown, the capital, was the latest sign that poor communication on Ebola by governments and global health agencies has led to public suspicion and people feeling resentful.
After visiting a house, a team makes a chalk mark on the outside to show that residents had been seen.
The aim of the project was to find Ebola sufferers who refused to go into isolation treatment wards, which places others at risk.

Six states are in federal court to challenge a California ban on the sale of eggs from hens kept in cramped cages.
Two years later, California lawmakers banned the sale of eggs \u2014 from any state \u2014 that have been produced by hens in "battery" cages.
Lawmakers in New York and Massachusetts also have considered laws.
Hayes estimates that 40 percent of the laying hens in Iowa will be killed to make room for the new space requirements for the California market by Jan. 1.
California is being sued in court because of its ban on the sale of eggs from hens kept in cramped cages.
"We don\'t want a trade war in America but we think that California is dead wrong on this," said Iowa Governor Terry Branstad.
If California can get away with this, it won\'t be long before the environmentalists in California tell us how we must build cars, grow crops, and raise cattle, too."
Michigan, Oregon and Washington have passed laws mandating more space for hens, and Ohio has banned the construction of new battery cages.
The 2010 law did not say what size or type of cage is acceptable, which has led to confusion.
It gives each hen space slightly smaller than a sheet of legal paper, which is 8.5x14 inches.

Oil company workers now visit the park to get away from it all.
Preserving a wild area is more important than ever, Naylor knows.
Valerie Naylor first saw this national park in North Dakota more than 40 years ago, when she was a teenager.
Today, North Dakota has more than 11,000 oil wells.
They want the sound of blowing wind and singing birds, not the noise of traffic.
The park is named after Theodore Roosevelt, U.S. president from 1901 to 1909.
Naylor wrote a letter to the company, asking it to move the project.
Hornfeldt said spending time in nature helps her relax and feel less stressed.

"Maybe someday,  some kid in Russia will read that and change his view on what sexuality is and what a gay person can accomplish."
Leading tech companies, including Google and Apple, rank high on the Human Rights Watch equality index, which tracks how companies treat gay workers.
"Once you have the Internet of people connecting with each other, and whether that\'s on Facebook or people connecting on apps, you can\'t reverse that," said Kenji Yoshino, a New York University professor who is writing a book on this topic.
Last week, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told the world that he is gay.
"Everyone is saying, \'Look at the most valuable company on the planet, and it\'s run by a gay man,\'" said gay-rights activist Chris Sinton.
Their influence could be valuable in countries such as Russia and Pakistan, where gays and lesbians are discriminated against \u2014 or worse.
Tackling gay rights around the world may be a natural next step for the tech community.
Tech companies have fought for gay rights more openly and aggressively than most other kinds of businesses.
In an information-based culture, everyone has seen a LGBT group\'s Facebook page, or a "coming out" video on YouTube.
Tim Cook, the top boss at Apple, announced last week that he is gay.
Tech companies are some of the richest and most powerful companies in the world.
"These big tech companies have offices overseas," said gay-rights activist Leanne Pittsford.
However, they have done little to bring more women, blacks and Latinos into their workforce.
"These big tech companies have offices overseas," she said.
Tim Cook, the top boss at Apple, announced last week that he is gay.
"Everyone is saying, \'Look at the most valuable company on the planet, and it\'s run by a gay man,\'" gay-rights activist Chris Sinton said.
Many tech businesses have a very open-minded attitude toward gays and lesbians.
This is partly because many of their workers are highly educated young people.
Tech leaders, she says, tend to be more honest about themselves than leaders in other industries.
It may move us one step closer to a world where workplaces treat everyone equally.
Tech companies are some of the richest and most powerful companies these days.
They are comfortable telling coworkers they are gay.
One in five students could not pass any of the tests conducted last year.
School systems instead were asked to develop new and innovative cardio programs to weave into an already time-pressed day.
State officials also asked for pledges for what they coined "Power Up for 30."
But exercise is now moving up the priority list as officials try to reduce obesity.
Huntley Hills Elementary School in Chamblee, one of the schools taking the pledge, has offered a morning program called "Tiger Tune Up," letting kids play in the gym before class starts, with everything from hula hoops to plastic balls.
She often brings out a cart with plastic balls and lets kids develop their own twist on a chase and tag game.

Three scientists in the United States won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discovering how key substances are transported within cells.
James Rothman, 62, Randy Schekman, 64, and Dr. Thomas Sudhof, 57, won for their research on how tiny bubbles called vesicles act as cargo carriers inside cells.
The awards in physics, chemistry, literature, peace and economics will be announced this week and next.
"It left an indelible mark on my memory."
Berg said the work provided the framework that scientists use to study how brain cells communicate and how other cells release hormones.
They have been handed out by award committees in Stockholm and Oslo since 1901.
Three scientists in the United States won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday.
James Rothman, 62, Randy Schekman, 64, and Dr. Thomas Sudhof, 57, shared the $1.2 million prize.
I didn\'t have anything elegant to say," he said.
Rothman showed in the 1980s and 1990s how vesicles delivered their cargo to the right places.
I have a lot of friends who might play these kinds of tricks," he said.
Three scientists in the United States worked for many years to figure out how important substances are moved within cells.
committee secretary Goran Hansson said.
Three scientists in the United States won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday.
Rothman works at Yale University and Schekman is at the University of California, Berkeley.
Rothman and Schekman won the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award in 2002.
Berg said the work provided the framework that scientists use to study how brain cells communicate.
The prizes were invented by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel.
Three scientists in the United States worked for many years to figure out how important substances are moved within cells.
Those discoveries have helped doctors diagnose a severe form of epilepsy, Hansson said.
The prizes were established by Swedish businessman Alfred Nobel.
They have been handed out since 1901.
Schekman is at the University of California, Berkeley.
He said he got the call from the head of the prize committee at 1 a.m.
The place where a kid can be a kid also wants to be the place where mom can get a cappuccino and dad can chow down on fancy pizza.
New menu items include California Alfredo thin and crispy pizza with mushrooms and spinach and, for a limited time, New York-style cheesecake.
Nationwide, the company rolled out the Cali Alfredo pizza along with a change to its BBQ chicken pizza, now with a smoky barbecue sauce and fried onions.
She doesn\'t think she\'d order any of the new pizzas on a regular "family fun day" outing.
"We are a real restaurant, and having that test kitchen will ensure that this is not just a one-time big bang," he said.
Beyond the food, the company is adding Wi-Fi to its U.S. locations.
"We want to make sure the adults are as excited about the visit as the children.
New menu items include thin and crispy pizza with mushrooms and spinach and, for a short time, New York-style cheesecake.
"If we provide a good experience for mom and dad, they are going to be more willing to take their kid to Chuck E. Cheese\'s instead of \u2026 going out to a competing place."
All locations in North Texas are being remodeled.
In some local stores, the company will test the new "play pass" system, replacing tokens.
"We want to make sure the adults are as excited about the visit as the children," he said.
"The menu was a great opportunity to really do that."
The change is meant to make the restaurant more appealing to adults.
New menu items include thin and crispy pizza with mushrooms and spinach and, for a short time, New York-style cheesecake.

None of the parents spotted during dinner were eating the new menu items.
Nearby, 38-year-old Zab Herrera also handed out slices of pepperoni pizza to his daughters.
"We want to make sure the adults are as excited about the visit as the children," he said.
But marine biologists \u2014 including SeaWorld critics \u2014 agree that the killer whales probably will never be released to the open seas.
"They are not good candidates for release to the wild, either because they were born in captivity or because they have been in captivity for a very long time," said Naomi Rose.
Caretakers say they spent up to $300,000 a month to care for and attempt to train the orca to feed itself in the wild.
During a short swim outside of the pen, accompanied by caretakers on a ship, Keiko swam away and turned up in a deep inlet in Norway.
"They are blindsiding it because they don\'t want a solution," said Ingrid Visser, founder of the Orca Research Trust, a nonprofit group dedicated to education and the research of orcas.
But marine biologists \u2014 including SeaWorld critics \u2014 agree that the orcas probably will never be released to the open seas.
No enclosed sea pens exist to hold all 11 killer whales.
"They would not be better off in sea pens than where they are now," said Chris Dold, the head veterinarian for SeaWorld Entertainment.
During the court hearing, SeaWorld critics waved banners calling for the release of the orcas.
"They are blindsiding it because they don\'t want a solution," said Ingrid Visser, founder of the Orca Research Trust.
A documentary released in 2013 accuses the company of neglecting and abusing its killer whales, or orcas.
Dold and other SeaWorld supporters say sea pens could expose killer whales to ocean toxins, viruses and harsh weather.
During the court hearing, SeaWorld critics waved banners calling for the release of the orcas.
It calls for SeaWorld Orlando in Florida to release an orca featured in "Blackfish," Tilikum, to a sea pen.
After several years at a theme park in Mexico City, Mexico, the killer whale was transported to a sea pen in Iceland in 1998.
There, he was found playing with children and fisherman along the shore.
"They are blindsiding it because they don\'t want a solution," said Ingrid Visser, founder of the Orca Research Trust.
A high court ruling in the case would guide lower courts in deciding such lawsuits in the future.
It might allow workers to sue smaller employers \u2014 those with eight workers versus those with 25 as required in federal cases.
Attorneys for Gate said that it "takes its legal obligations very seriously, including those that are designed to protect the rights of its employees."
While low in numbers, religious-based workplace complaints to both state and federal governments have been on the rise since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
It found that the most common religious-based conflicts involved being required to work on a religious holiday or attending company events where foods were not halal, kosher or vegetarian.

For safety reasons, it prohibits its workers from bringing their own meals to work.
This comes at a time when employees are increasingly expressing their religion at work.
She said state law does not require employers to allow for religious practices.
She claimed her supervisor told her to give false information to another employee which was against her religious beliefs.
In doing so, it concluded that the Supreme Court, lawmakers and the Human Rights Commission, which enforces discrimination law, had never formally recognized religious allowances under state law.
It could set the standard for the allowances employers must make.
While low in numbers, workplace complaints regarding religion have been on the rise since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
Still, most lawyers in the state say they file employee discrimination cases in federal, rather than state, court.
Hardeep Rekhi, a Seattle lawyer, recently won a lawsuit he filed for a Muslim man.
Do businesses have to let their workers practice their religion at work?
He is an Orthodox Christian, which is a form of Christianity practiced in Ethiopia and Egypt.
That was 15 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 created those rights at the national level.
Should they give workers days off for religious holidays, or time to pray during work hours?
The lawsuit was brought by four workers of Gate Gourmet.
He is an Orthodox Christian, which is a form of Christianity practiced in Ethiopia and Egypt.
She said state law does not force businesses to allow for religious practices.
They might be able to sue companies with as few as eight workers.
Only businesses with 25 people or more can be sued in national court.
While low in numbers, problems regarding religion at work have been on the rise since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
One was being made to work on a religious holiday.
The company makes food for airline passengers.
But it is still understood as being part of the law, they say.
He recently won a lawsuit he filed for a Muslim man.
The men say the meals the company served to the workers had pork in them.
This comes at a time when workers are increasingly expressing their religion in the workplace.
So most lawyers in Washington state file such worker cases in national courts.
Rekhi filed the case in national courts rather than state court.
Four years ago, Mary Visconti figured out an unusual way to keep her students out of trouble.
Visconti rounded up donated skeins of yarn and plastic knitting needles and hired an art teacher.
"Part of our logic behind the lab was that they would form a community."
Shukurieya McClennon, 13, said it helped her develop her own sense of style.
"I can just make them."
Students can keep one item each; the rest are sold.
If they call in sick one day, they make up the time.
Students have learned to dye yarn lively colors with Kool-Aid, weave rugs with strips of ratty old T-shirts and "knit bomb" \u2014 knit around objects like chairs, handrails and bike racks.
On a gloomy day last month, the students clustered around a folding table in the KnitLAB to create scarves.
The room was small, and boxes of donated yarn in a rainbow of colors crowded a massive bookshelf.
Knitting needles were stuffed haphazardly in vases and cups.
Artreuna Dotson, 14, rearranged the colors with long, nimble fingers and sprayed them with a soapy solution to set the design.
"For kids from a challenging situation, it can bring a sense of grounding that they can take home with them."
Students are paid salaries of $325 each over 10-week sessions to create products ranging from hat and scarf sets to rugs and quilts.
They are allowed to keep one item each, and the rest are sold.

"With knitting, it can take weeks to finish a single project."
The lab has about 15 kids in each 10-week session.
On a gloomy day last month, the students gathered around a table in the KnitLAB to make scarves.
"I thought this would probably be boring at first," Akenna said.
"You think of a grandma sitting in her front room knitting with all her cats."
Knitting is not just for grandmothers.
If they call in sick, they have to make the time up.
Knitting, she said, has forced her to be open to other ideas.

She said knitting has made her open to new ideas.
Yet, the other part of that growth is the high adoption rates among high school students attracted to the variety of e-cig flavors, including cotton candy, gummy bear and root beer float.
Users inhale this flavored vapor and not burning tobacco, which means e-cigs are safer compared to cigarettes.
Initial findings from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health indicate high levels of "dual use" of tobacco products, meaning that smokers frequently use both e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes.
These findings are consistent with other studies that have found that rather than helping people quit smoking, e-cigarettes may actually make it harder for smokers to quit.
Nicotine is addictive and it is a poison \u2014 two facts that the FDA should make clear by requiring warning labels on e-cigarette devices and vials of e-juices.
Skin contact with even small quantities of liquid nicotine can cause dizziness, vomiting and seizures.
Some want bans on the sale of e-cigarettes, or grossly high taxes on e-cigarettes, or even outright bans on the use of e-cigarettes in public.
But such policies mean nicotine addicts will be less likely to use e-cigarettes.
Which means America should not treat e-cigarettes and vaping just like tobacco smoking and smoking.
In 2014, the Oxford English Dictionary\'s word of the year was "vape."
It should write its own definition of e-cigarettes \u2014 a definition that will treat them as a tobacco product.
And herein lies the possible merit of the e-cigarette: it could be a powerful tool for saving millions of lives if smokers switched from puffing to vaping to, ideally, nothing.
Over this half-century of cigarette regulation, two facts have been public knowledge: 1) smoking tobacco kills people; 2) once a person is addicted to smoking cigarettes, or to the nicotine one ingests by smoking cigarettes, it is very hard for a person to quit.
He says e-cigarette regulation should take into account that different nicotine products "pose different levels of risk to the individual," and regulate accordingly.
Because of that, a carefully crafted regulatory policy that steers Americans from smoking toward vaping as a replacement provides "an extraordinary public health opportunity."
In short, the FDA was made to watch over products just like e-cigarettes.
"What if" vaping turns out to be harmful?
The director of the FDA\'s Center for Tobacco Products, Mitch Zeller, made the key point clear: "People are smoking for the nicotine, but dying from the tar."
Skin contact with even small amounts of liquid nicotine can cause dizziness, vomiting and seizures.
Over these 50 years of cigarette laws, two facts have been repeated over and over: 1) smoking tobacco kills people; 2) once a person is addicted to smoking cigarettes, or, really, the nicotine in cigarettes, it is very hard for a person to quit.
How do they go about banning a product that saves lives?
The obvious result will be more tobacco smoking and thus, more illness and death.
And it is a market that is booming.
The FDA should prohibit sales and advertising to kids and make sure that health claims made by e-cig companies are true.
Initial evidence from a major new study should cause regulators to stop and think.
They have likewise found that rather than helping people quit smoking, e-cigs may actually make it harder for smokers to quit.
Researchers at the University of California-San Francisco found that 95 percent of e-cig websites either made outright claims that they had health benefits, or hinted there were some.
It soon required health warnings on cigarette packages and bans on cigarette commercials on radio and television.
They have nicotine just like a tobacco cigarette, but without any apparent link to cancer or lung disease.
Finally there was a product that could help those who were addicted and for whom the available anti-smoking aids had not been of sufficient help.
Instead, they may be more likely to keep smoking tobacco.
The director of the Food and Drug Administration\'s Center for Tobacco Products, Mitch Zeller, made the key point clear: "People are smoking for the nicotine, but dying from the tar."
These findings agree with other studies that found that rather than helping people quit smoking, e-cigarettes may actually make it harder for smokers to quit.
Based on those studies, the report cited tobacco smoking as a major cause of lung and throat cancer.
It soon led to health warnings on cigarette packages and bans on cigarette commercials on radio and television.
Which means America should not treat e-cigarettes and vaping just like tobacco smoking and smoke.
Skin contact with even small amounts of liquid nicotine can cause dizziness, vomiting and seizures.
"What if" people who vape start smoking?
Which means America should not treat e-cigarettes just like cigarettes.
The agency was created to help people know whether a product is safe and healthy.
Right now more than 16 million children can legally buy e-cigs and give themselves as much nicotine as they want.
Accidentally drinking liquid nicotine has caused a huge increase in poisonings \u2014 including the death of a toddler in New York state two months ago.
They predict it will rise to $10 billion annually by 2017.
Yet, the other reason is the growth in the number of high school students using them.
E-cigs should be regulated, not banned.
"Juice" sounds harmless, but it\'s far from it.
It is, in fact, flavored nicotine liquid.
At least, people inhale this flavored vapor and not burning tobacco.
And here is the possible value of the e-cigarette: it could be a powerful tool for saving millions of lives if smokers switched from puffing to vaping, and then to nothing.
Initial evidence from a major new study should make people stop and think.
The FDA should make both of these facts clear by requiring warning labels on e-cigarettes and bottles of e-juices.
It looked at scientific evidence from more than 7,000 articles on smoking and disease.
It soon led to health warnings on cigarette packages and bans on cigarette commercials on radio and television.
And that horrible smell would be replaced with just the light scent of a flavor like mint or strawberry.
How can they try to ban a product that saves lives?
The director of the FDA\'s Center for Tobacco Products, Mitch Zeller, made the key point clear: "People are smoking for the nicotine, but dying from the tar."
He says e-cigarette regulation should take into account that different nicotine products "pose different levels of risk to the individual."
"Juice" sounds harmless, but it\'s not.
Researchers at the University of California-San Francisco found that more than 9 out of 10 e-cig websites either claimed that they had health benefits, or hinted there were some.
Over these 50 years of cigarette laws, two facts have been repeated over and over: 1) smoking tobacco kills people; 2) once a person is addicted to smoking cigarettes, or, really, the nicotine in cigarettes, it is very hard for a person to quit.
Some even want total bans on the use of e-cigarettes in public.
He made the key point clear: "People are smoking for the nicotine, but dying from the tar."
In fact, vaping can help people to stop smoking.
They contain nicotine, so it should define them as a tobacco product.
At the time, food and drugs were filled with toxic dyes and preservatives.
The agency was created to help people know if a product is safe and healthy.
The many types of e-cig flavors attract young people.
The FDA should stop sales and advertising to kids.
Burning tobacco releases thousands of chemicals, so e-cigs are safer than cigarettes.
In recent years, smoking has been banned in some public places, like restaurants.
People who had tried other ways of quitting now had another shot.
Others want to add grossly high taxes on them.
He made the key point clear: "People are smoking for the nicotine, but dying from the tar."
Which means America should not treat e-cigarettes just like cigarettes.
Because of that, we need carefully written rules.
If it steers Americans from smoking toward vaping as a replacement, it will provide "an extraordinary public health opportunity," in Zeller\'s words.
They were seeking birds that could survive a hotter planet.
Backed by millions of dollars from the federal government, they are racing to develop new breeds of farm animals that can stand up to [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).
In agriculture, "we are dealing with the challenge of difficult weather conditions at the same time we have to massively increase food production,"  said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.
"We have to start now to anticipate what changes we have to make in order to feed 9 billion people."
"It\'s a big problem when it happens," said Gale Strasburg, a professor of food science and human nutrition at Michigan State University.
He added, "If we start seeing a lot more shifts in summer temperature extremes, there is going to be more of this."
The hope is ultimately to enable industry to breed turkeys that can withstand the heat.
The scientists working to create breeds of animals that can cope with a warmer climate argue that they, too, are focused on depleting fewer resources.
He pointed to the lack of feathers on its bare neck, which help it keep cool.
A few buildings away, some of his graduate students delicately place drops of chicken blood into test tubes to map their genes.
But Schmidt says where he hopes his work can be most beneficial is in increasing the chances of survival for chickens in poverty-stricken areas of Africa and South America.
The issue is helping these chickens or any animals survive in a state of increased heat."
If the developing world doesn\'t have enough food, he said, "that affects everybody."
Some climate change activists dismiss their work, which is just getting under way.
The scientists, though, say new breeds of farm animals that can resist heat will be essential to feeding the world.
"If we start seeing a lot more shifts in summer temperature extremes, there is going to be more of this," he said.
So the only way to reduce greenhouse gases may be to encourage people to eat less meat, they say.
Gates, the founder of Microsoft, supports technology that uses pea proteins to create beef and chicken that look like the real thing.
But Schmidt says his work can be most helpful in increasing the survival of chickens in poverty-stricken areas of Africa and South America.
Two years ago, scientists traveled to Africa.
If they don\'t have enough food "that affects everybody," he said.
But the government would not actually shut down.
Prisoners would still be held in federal jails.
"Hundreds of thousands of government workers will not be working," said Brian Deese of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
The White House told federal agencies last week to begin planning for a partial shutdown.
Managers have to decide which employees are essential and would be required to come to work.
They would decide who on their staffs was essential.
Taxes would be collected but judges would have to go home when the courts run out of money.
For example, Anderson said, the OMB could determine that  the National Zoo must close.
He said that if there is a positive outcome of a shutdown it could be that people may start thinking about which services the government provides are necessary and which should be permanently dropped.
Prisoners would still be held in U.S. jails.
He said figuring out which employees are essential is difficult and keeps changing.
For example, Anderson said, the OMB could say that the National Zoo must close.
People may start thinking about which services the government provides are necessary and which should be permanently dropped.
Until last week, Florida black bears were a source of awe and amusement to their suburban neighbors.
The big lugs made repeated appearances in areas throughout Seminole County and other Central Florida communities.
State wildlife experts regularly assured uneasy callers that the beasts would leave them alone if they followed some rules such as locking down their garbage.
All of that changed Dec. 2, when Susan Chalfant, a 54-year-old resident of Wingfield North near Wekiwa Springs State Park was mauled while walking her two small dogs.
Because of the attack, the agency plans to hire more wildlife contractors to trap and relocate bears, or catch and kill them.
Bear hunting, which is not permitted in Florida, also is part of the strategy in New Jersey, where hunters killed 287 bears in 2012.

And, despite early indications of shopper gloominess, 158 million consumers plan to celebrate Halloween in some manner this year.
A survey distributed recently by the NRF indicates that nearly nine in 10 people plan to spend less on candy, costumes and decorations this Halloween season compared with last year.
About a quarter of the 5,200 consumers surveyed cited the economy as the main reason for the decline.
Plus, smaller items, including spider-web earrings and people paints, are hot this season.
For retailers, Halloween is an important revenue bridge between the two biggest events of the year: back-to-school and Christmas buying seasons.
"Halloween is one of the most popular holidays of the year, and while we are expecting people to cut back on their spending a bit this Halloween, there\'s no sense it will be a bust," said Kathy Grannis of the National Retail Federation (NRF).

Not all retailers are reporting Halloween-spending jitters.
Shoppers are expected to spend $330 million on pet costumes.

When a king penguin feels threatened, it can shuffle away while keeping its egg or baby chick balanced on its feet.
Perhaps future robots could even be designed to follow around swimming and flying creatures as well.
"When the rover was camouflaged with a penguin model, all adult and chick emperor penguins allowed it to approach close enough for an electronic identification," the scientists wrote.
Maybe rovers in the future might be able to follow around swimming and flying creatures as well.
Maybe rovers in the future might be able to follow around swimming and flying creatures too.
A team led by scientists from the University of Strasbourg in France have designed a rover that looks like a fluffy penguin chick.
When humans study animals in the wild, it is better to stay out of the way and let the robots do the work.
When the penguins shuffle away, they move into the spaces of other nearby penguins.
Of the 158 birds that were tested with the robot, 28 percent "reacted with alertness," 47 percent did not seem to notice at all, and 25 percent were curious about the rover and moved closer to check it out.
The adorable spy was even more successful than the plain-looking robot.
Maybe rovers in the future might be able to follow around swimming and flying creatures as well.

But health-minded diners at the Da Dong restaurant chain here in the Chinese capital have one excuse: They did a little weightlifting before their meal.
And diners are handed two other menus: a selection of seasonal items running 24 pages and a wine list of a relatively thin 19 pages.
All over China, high-end eateries have been supersizing.
And countless run-of-the-mill restaurants offer customers menus as large and colorful as American high school yearbooks.
Chinese cooking is very varied, and also very adjustable.
In addition, low wages in comparison with the West make it easier to have more cooks in the kitchen.
Typically, dinner party hosts like to show their generosity by ordering a wide range of dishes.
Dong Zhenxiang, the chef behind Da Dong, says he started adding photos to his menu in the early 1990s.
Even I, as a professional chef, it\'s taken me years to realize why some dishes have their names."
As his menu grew more elaborate, Dong found himself with a problem: Customers were pinching them at a pace that made running his restaurants difficult.
Now, his mega-menus are made once a year at a top printing house in Shenzhen, and theft is way down: Their sheer size makes them difficult to steal.
Countless other restaurants offer customers menus as large and colorful as American high school yearbooks.

At a small community park in Santa Monica, a group of Los Angeles-area musicians gathered around a flatbed truck.
"Make no mistake, music that we produce" is critical to the "artistic and financial success of any film that\'s produced here," said Neil Samples, a violinist.
After his speech, Samples and the others drove a few blocks to the headquarters of Lionsgate, the studio behind the hit "Hunger Games" movies.
They accused Marvel of hiring London musicians to work on such movies as "The Avengers" and "Iron Man 3" even though those films were shot in the United States.
It says the studio is hiring foreign musicians to play music on movies that were filmed in the United States.
It has cited such Lionsgate releases as "The Hunger Games" and "The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn," which were scored in London, and the recently released "Draft Day."
"One of the fantastic things about being a musician in LA is that you\'re surrounded by just an astonishing level of players," said violinist Marc Sazer.
For example, musicians in Macedonia might get paid only $10 to $15 an hour and not receive any contributions to health and pension plans.
But unlike other studios, Lionsgate does not have an agreement with the union that would require it to score music in the United States if it shoots the movie or TV show here.
"Make no mistake, music that we produce" is critical to the "success of any film that\'s produced here," said Neil Samples, a violinist.

Seconds later, viewers watching the show live on TV saw a scary picture of a gazebo battered by wind and rain.
The station called itself Hurricane Central.
Helped by a steady string of blizzards, hurricanes and tornadoes, the cable channel has brought in more money while some other media outlets have struggled.
The decision upset meteorologists and the National Weather Service, which is responsible for naming hurricanes.
Its coverage of what it called "Nemo," the snowstorm that blanketed much of the East Coast in February, featured headlines such as "YOU MUST PREPARE NOW."
It ran an article headlined "Snow Panic Has Driven Weather.com Completely Insane."
It has also beefed up its website with feature stories and photo galleries that are only slightly weather-related.
Since then, the Weather Channel started airing more reality shows and programs like "Deadliest Space Weather" and "Forecasting the End."
"Forecasting the End" is about how "catastrophic weather or natural disasters could" cause the end of the world.
It pitched itself as a necessity for viewers trying to plan their days who wanted to know what kind of weather they might find.
So the Weather Channel had to give viewers something different, said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group.

Complaints range from doubts about their effectiveness to concern about whether the impact on the ecosystem has been adequately studied.
Another critic, Camilo Rodriguez-Beltran, a French-trained biosecurity expert working in Chile, said the gene-altered mosquitoes could cross international boundaries.
A Panamanian environmental lawyer, Olmedo Carrasquilla, said his nation should better educate the public on mosquito control.

Olmedo Carrasquilla, an environmental lawyer in Panama, said his nation should better educate the public on mosquito control.
Scientists have created a new type of mosquito.
The mosquito that carries the dengue virus has spread to 100 countries and potentially exposes 2.5 billion people to the terrible disease.
Teams patrol the streets spraying chemicals in a constant battle against the mosquito.

Yosemite High School once offered six wood shop classes.
The number of students is down from 1,100 five years ago to about 700 today.
Though the local Chinese food is not to their satisfaction, they appreciate the clean air and the elbow room.
In looking abroad to fill seats, Yosemite is following the lead of high schools in Maine and New York, among other places.
"And because there\'s a lack of regulation, you\'re just going to see a lot of people rushing into this field driven by profit rather than the desire to provide students and schools with a quality experience."
These students plan to stay in the United States for college, skipping a brutally competitive educational system back home.
Some experts say more rules are needed to manage the boom.
At Murrieta Valley High School, Jixian "Johnny" Wang said he enjoys more free time and extracurriculars than he did in China.

At a time when so much may seem uncertain, the people of Ferguson can have confidence that the Justice Department intends to learn exactly what happened.
On Wednesday, I was in Ferguson to receive an update on the federal civil rights investigation that I launched more than one week ago.
We hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm to the tensions in Ferguson.
Although these acts have been committed by a very small minority \u2014 and, in many cases, by individuals from outside Ferguson \u2014 they hurt, rather than help, the cause of justice.
And they interrupt the deeper conversation that the peaceful demonstrators are trying to advance.
Enforcement and arrest patterns must not lead to treating groups of people differently under the law, even if such treatment is unintended.
Conversations should continue \u2014 but they must also be converted into concrete action.
And it is painfully clear, across our great nation, that more progress, more conversation, and more action are needed.
This is my pledge to the people of Ferguson: Our investigation into this matter will be full, it will be fair, and it will not be influenced by anyone.
And beyond the investigation itself, we will work with the police, civil rights leaders, and members of the public to ensure that this tragedy can give rise to new understanding \u2014 and strong action \u2014 aimed at bridging the gaps between law enforcement officials and the communities we serve.
Long after the events of Aug. 9 are gone from the headlines, the Justice Department will continue to stand with this community.
In research published this week in the journal Antiquity, scholars wrote that the evidence supports a 6th century B.C.
According to Buddhist tradition, Siddhartha Gautama, as he was known before he became enlightened, was born in a garden, beneath a tree.
Coningham said that because of this belief, it was not surprising that a tree would feature prominently in the shrine.
"This is one of those rare occasions when belief, tradition, archaeology and science actually come together, because here we have a very early shrine built around a tree," Coningham said.
The Lumbini temple is one of four key temples associated with the life of Buddha.
The first Lumbini shrine was likely built by wealthy followers of Buddhism at a time when the religion was considered a cult.
Later shrines were constructed with large open areas as well, researchers said.
At some point, the temple was forgotten and overgrown by jungle.
Coningham said that because of this tradition, it was not surprising that a tree would be an important part of the shrine.
And it was found to have a large sandstone column with an inscription that called the site Lumbini and said the emperor Ashoka had visited there.
"It had never been covered by a roof," Coningham said.
New evidence found in Nepal may provide a better answer for the question of when the Buddha was born, according to archaeologists.
And it was found to have a large sandstone column with an inscription that called the site Lumbini and said the emperor Ashoka had visited there.
Researchers used fragments of charcoal from the early wooden temple and grains of sand to date the structure.
More than 350 million people around the world follow the teachings of the Buddha.
The original wood structure appears to have been built around an open space.

More than 350 million people around the world follow the teachings of the Buddha.
The Lumbini temple is one of four important temples in the life of Buddha.
He got the name of Buddha after he reached a great level of knowledge and wisdom, also called enlightenment.
Hundreds of thousands of monks, nuns and pilgrims visit Lumbini each year to pay respect to the Buddha.
And the temple remained open to them as the archaeologists did their dig.
But, it was rediscovered in 1869.

Bradley Manning to 35 years in a military prison on Wednesday, Aug. 21 for the largest-ever leak of classified U.S. documents.
Lind had found Manning guilty of the theft of an estimated 700,000 documents.
The items ranged from diplomatic cables and intelligence assessments to a video of a U.S. Apache helicopter attack.
Defense lawyer David Coombs asked Lind to issue a sentence that allowed Manning to "have a life" when he left prison.
Manning can apply for release after serving one-third of his sentence.
"I am sorry for the unintended consequences of my actions," Manning told Lind during a sentencing hearing.
But prosecutors charged him with additional crimes, including spying.
Lind heard testimony from witnesses in both closed and open court sessions.
State Department officials testified about the consequences of having 250,000 department documents made public.

People are more likely to get hurt on older rides than on newer ones.
And about 1 in 8 injuries involve riders who were hurt while getting on or off.
In all, the newspaper went through 2,089 injury reports from 57 theme parks that were filed from 2007 through 2012 with the state Department of Industrial Relations.
The largest number of reports, about 18 percent, involved motion sickness, including fainting, nausea and dizziness.
Back and neck pain ranked second, at 16 percent.

By comparison, the odds of being injured in the bathroom \u2014 and requiring a visit to the hospital \u2014 are about 1 in 1,037.
The age of Space Mountain, which opened in 1977 may also be a factor in its injury rate.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will consider the case of a California man whose smartphone got him in serious trouble.
The Supreme Court must decide if smartphones are covered by the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Some fear that a ruling against Riley and Wurie would make the secrets of cellphone owners far too easy to uncover.
Riley was pulled over by a San Diego police officer on Aug. 22, 2009, prosecutors and defense lawyers agree.
On it were video clips of gang fights, pictures of gang signs and clips of a red car allegedly used in an earlier gang shooting.
Convicted on charges that included attempted murder, Riley was sentenced to prison for 15 years to life.

Now, at least seven of the 45 states that adopted the standards are trying to restore cursive instruction.
"Modern research indicates that more areas of the human brain are engaged when children use cursive handwriting than when they keyboard," said Bateman, who handwrites 125 letters each year.
Cursive advocates point to recent brain science: Research indicates that the fluid motion employed when writing script enhances hand-eye coordination and develops fine motor skills.
The percentage using smartphones to go online has grown from 23 percent in 2011 to 37 percent today, according to the Pew Research Center.
But many still use handwriting for notes, letters, journals, short stories or music lyrics \u2014 as well as for school.
"Jack assured me that he is going to work to make at least one letter legible" in order not to devalue our currency, the president joked at the time.

"Modern research indicates that more areas of the human brain are engaged when children use cursive handwriting than when they keyboard," said Bateman.
States that adopted Common Core are allowed to offer courses that were left off the list of preferred offerings.
But in many schools these days, classroom time is limited and the pressure to get good grades is high.

Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, along with an Egyptian and a couple of Georgians, also have done well this year.
This is partly the result of a general trend away from rigid traditions in Japan, and also because the life of a professional sumo wrestler is particularly tough.
"Sumo is not a familiar sport compared to others like soccer and baseball," said Kento Nakazawa of the Japan Sumo Association.
Toshiyo Abe sat on the tatami mats watching his 6-year-old son Shotaro wrestle older boys.
Shotaro asked to start sumo a year ago, so now they travel an hour by train to the dojo every Saturday and Sunday.
Some parents, however, balk at a key part of getting ahead in sumo: being heavy.
"Some high school clubs make you eat until you throw up, but some clubs just leave it to you to bulk up," said Akiteru Kiyomiya as he watched his two sons train.
After the four-hour training session, coach Shinju Taira said he worried about the decline of sumo both as a sport and as a part of Japanese culture.

The story of how 12 Norwegian saboteurs parachuted into the nearby tundra and survived freezing temperatures to destroy the factory\'s "heavy water" plant inspired a 1965 Hollywood film, "The Heroes of Telemark."
The century-old idea was revived in 2005 by artist Martin Andersen, a resident of the town who helped raise the sponsorship money.
The sun is finally shining on the small Norwegian town of Rjukan.
But a band encouraged it to move away with the song, "Let The Sunshine In."
TV footage of the event showed the center of the crowded square light up.
They were flown in by helicopters in and installed 1,500 feet above the town square.
They are more commonly used to create solar power in sun-drenched regions of the Middle East.
Zoo spokeswoman Tracy Gray said the use of dogs was part of "providing the best care possible for our African elephants."
"The primary reason the herding dogs are working with our team is for the safety of our staff," she said.
The USDA ruled that the exhibit did not have sufficient distance and barriers between the animals and zoo visitors.
In 1989, a keeper suffered a broken leg, cuts and bruises when an elephant kicked him as he was about to give it medicine.
Handler Mike Gatti, 46, was killed in 2002 when a mother elephant pushed her head on his chest after he fell to the ground.
Yet Gray said the zoo stands by its handling of elephants.
In July 1989, a keeper suffered a broken leg, cuts and bruises when an elephant kicked him.
Another handler, Mike Gatti, 46, was killed in 2002 when a mother elephant pushed her head on his chest after he fell to the ground.
She said the Pittsburgh Zoo should follow the example of the San Diego Zoo, the North Carolina Zoo and the Oakland Zoo.
Workers at the zoo are training dogs to bite, chase and annoy 15,000-pound elephants, Peet said.
The dogs and elephants work well together, she said.

People die about 5.5 years sooner in northern China than their countrymen in the south.
This information was then compared with death rates in 145 locations across the country from 1991 to 2000.
Yet this new research specifically shows that pollution does lower life expectancy.
In China the researchers found an ideal place to examine the effects of air pollution.
Previous Chinese governments gave people north of the river free coal to burn in winter.
But the decision created two experimental groups on either side of the river that could be compared with each other.
Air pollution is measured by total suspended particulates (TSPs).
The researchers estimated that 500 million residents of northern China altogether lost 2.5 billion years from their lives.
Another co-author, Yuyu Chen of Peking University, said: "It\'s a huge loss.
The pollution closed highways, forced the cancellations of airline flights and outdoor activities.
Another spell of terrible air besieged Beijing in late June.
In June, the government announced a package of 10 anti-pollution policies.
Heavy polluters have been asked to reduce their emissions by 30 percent by the end of 2017.
Chen said that Chinese citizens would be willing to give up some financial development in order to prolong their lives.
He concluded that the public would forgo up to 2 percentage points of economic growth to reduce TSPs by 100 micrograms per cubic meter.
Azucena Lozoya, 16, said she signed up for the gardening program because she never had a chance to try anything like it before.
KAR, Senegal - President Barack Obama arrived in this corner of West Africa to deliver messages about civil society and good governance, democracy and development.
The greeting was plastered on signs and T-shirts wherever Obama went Thursday during his first full day of a week-long, three-country trip to Africa.
Although Obama was born and raised in Hawaii, his father was born and is buried in Kenya.
It is said that men, women and children were traded, weighed and shackled there before being sent across the Atlantic to the Americas.
But the president described the visit as a meaningful experience.
He said it was especially powerful for his family "to be able to come here and to fully appreciate the magnitude of the slave trade, to get a sense in a very intimate way of the incredible inhumanity and hardship that people faced" before crossing the Atlantic.

He spent about half an hour in the two-story salmon-colored house that is filled with dark holding cells.
"Obviously, for an African-American \u2014 and an African-American president \u2014 to be able to visit this site, I think, gives me even greater motivation" to defend human rights, Obama said.
But the Obamas were the first to make the visit knowing that some of their ancestors had experienced such cruelty.

Nearly 3.2 million people have been forced out of their homes since fighters from the Islamic State group began to seize Iraqi territory early last year.
Now, Iraqis in Baghdad have lived through a decade of constant car bombs, more than one-quarter of the country is controlled by the Islamic State group, and a fall in oil prices is causing an economic crisis.
"I think about my country, and how it needs people like me," Falah said, adding that five of his friends have also left.
There are thousands like me that are leaving.
They lost everything when they were forced to flee their home in Fallujah at the beginning of 2014, when the Islamic State group seized control.
"I\'d tear up my identity card right now for the chance to go to Europe," said Obaid, who was badly injured after an American airstrike hit his house in 2003.
Life is not too bad for 24-year-old Mohammed Falah.
The United Nations (U.N.) states that more than 50,000 Iraqis have left in the past three months.
Nearly 3.2 million people have been forced out of their homes since Islamic State fighters began to seize Iraqi territory last year.
"I saw this wave of young people who were going, many of my friends going, and I saw this as a chance," said Falah, who hopes to make it to Germany.
He was at the top of his class when he graduated from college two years ago, but has struggled since to find a job, and now works at a car wash. Jassim says, "My wife and my friends encouraged me to leave.
There are thousands like me that are leaving."
Arkan Naji Obaid, 37, and his mother are in a camp for displaced families in Baghdad.
Now they cannot afford to leave the country.
"If people had the money to go, this camp would be empty," Obaid said.
The wrecked cruise liner Costa Concordia was successfully pried from the rocks it had been wedged against for the last 20 months on Tuesday.
The operation to straighten the 300-meter, 114,000-ton vessel took 19 hours.
The tanks were filled with water and used as counterweights in the effort to pull up the wreck, which rested on a false seabed.
Engineers were next planning to inspect the side that emerged from the water, which was covered in brown mud and was heavily deformed.
The idea is to attach tanks on that side, and use them to refloat the ship by emptying them of water and filling them with air.
Franco Porcellacchia, an engineer overseeing operations for owner Costa Crociere, was confident it could all be done in the first half of next year.
Work cannot be done faster because of the difficulty of operating during winter weather.
The risk was that the rusting hull could snap or sink entirely, jeopardizing the entire salvage operation and causing an environmental disaster.
The sinking of the Concordia, attributed to the irresponsible behavior of its Italian captain, Francesco Schettino, has been a national shame.
The cruise ship Costa Concordia crashed against a reef on Jan. 12, 2012.
All those working on the rescue "are a great (source) of Italian pride," Prime Minister Enrico Letta wrote.
He invited Gabrielli and others to Rome.
Rescuers were expected to board the vessel to look for their bodies.
He abandoned the Concordia before all passengers had left the ship.

He "has the sense of responsibility necessary to become head of state and launch a new stage of hope," Juan Carlos said.
But there have also been clouds for the king, who has reigned since 1975.
His relaxed style was balanced by his more formal wife, Greek-born Queen Sofia.
The groups have long called Juan Carlos a symbol of a country to which they do not want to belong.
There were also other mistakes, such as the infamous 2007 exchange between the king and former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez who had just called Juan Carlos a fascist.
He was said to know something that every royal family should remember \u2014 that kings are not born, but made by the people.
The judge in those cases did not sentence Morsi, postponing his final verdict until next month.
El-Sissi then presided over a widespread crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and others who opposed his rule.
The court also said that Morsi and the other accused were "looting poultry and livestock" from prison grounds.
"Today will be remembered as one of the darkest days" in Egypt\'s history, said Amr Darrag, another member of the Muslim Brotherhood and a former member of Morsi\'s cabinet.
Morsi arrived in court smiling and wearing a blue prison uniform.
On Saturday a Cairo court sentenced the former president of Egypt, Mohammed Morsi, to death.
More than 100 other people, most of whom are not in Egyptian prisons, were also sentenced to death on the same charges.
They were accused of giving state secrets to Iran while Morsi was in power.
As the court announced he would be put to death, Morsi and the other prisoners chanted against the military.
Two years ago, Mohammed Morsi was the president of Egypt.

"We join as one people to honor a debt we can never fully repay," Obama said at Arlington National Cemetery.
Among the ceremonies around the nation was one for two of the original Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African-American pilots in World War II.
The president was joined by representatives of all of the services: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard.
It was meant to remember the end of World War I.
Memorial Day, at the end of May, remembers all those who died while serving.
So it is not uncommon for soldiers to have served in more than one conflict.
According to the government, 14.7 million veterans voted in the 2012 presidential election, a large turnout of 70 percent.
President Harry Truman officially ended discrimination in the armed forces in 1948.
"This is the life of one American veteran, living proud and strong in the land he helped keep free," Obama said.

President Barack Obama announced Thursday he would place new restrictions on the targeting of terrorists with missiles fired from drones.
But a new rule book would hold U.S. authorities to a tougher standard when deciding whom to kill, where, and under what circumstances, White House officials said.
"To say a military tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance," Obama said.
His administration has faced skepticism from Congress, which has held a series of hearings on targeted killing.
The tactic is known as "signature strikes," where the CIA fired missiles at groups of suspected militants whose identities were unknown.
"In the Afghan war theater, we must support our troops until the transition is complete at the end of 2014," he said.
"That means we will continue to take strikes against high-value al-Qaida targets, but also against forces that are massing to support attacks on coalition forces.
U.S. officials said that is making U.S. drone strikes less needed.

Under the old rules, anyone who was considered to be a major threat could be a target of a drone strike.
Before a drone strike can be approved, it must be certain that no innocent people will be killed or injured, a top White House official said.
One of the victims was the 16-year-old son of a terrorist suspect.
However, the president still wants to be able to order the deadly attacks anywhere the White House finds a threat from al-Qaida.

Tesla Motors already claims to have the electric car that can go the longest between charges.
Tesla is trying to become the first successful brand new U.S. car maker in nearly a century.
Tesla collects special credits from California as well as other environmental credits every time it sells a Model S. The credits have helped its profits.
The "crumple zone" is designed to be smashed and absorb some of the energy in a crash.
Back to the roads, Tesla started selling the Model S about a year ago.
It has sold about $150 million of these rewards to other automakers so far this year.
But car makers receive an overall score that can show a rating above five, Tesla said.

type of California kingsnake that is popular as a pet has overrun the Canary Islands.
"The trouble is, these snakes spend much of their lives beneath the ground," said Robert Reed.
"This snake will quite possibly impact the local reptilian population to the point where we see their total disappearance," the study said.
The Canary Islands used to be a stable ecosystem.
Dogs and hawks have been used against the snakes.
The wolf snake was introduced to the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius.
It will happen more often as people have more money and get interested in owning unusual pets, he said.

Gay couples woke up in Ireland Sunday morning and began planning their weddings.
On Saturday, the Irish people voted with a surprisingly strong 62 percent "yes" to change the constitution to allow gay couples to marry.
Because current law requires at least a three-month notice for any civil marriages, the first gay weddings cannot happen until autumn.

President Barack Obama rolled out a new plan to make two years of community college free, or nearly so, for millions of students across the country.
At its heart is federal funding that would cover 75 percent of tuition, with the states picking up the rest of the cost.
"Anything involving more money to pay for things is going to be difficult in this Congress," said Ben Miller, an education policy analyst at the New America Foundation.
"Increasing investments in higher education are just hard to find," he said.
He has urged states to take school performance into consideration when distributing money to their public colleges.
"We see right now that so many students and families really don\'t have a great sense of how much college is going to cost."

Archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago.
The tomb, found last week, was heavily looted, but hieroglyphs on the chamber walls clearly identified it as belonging to a ruler named Woseribre Senebkay, the Penn team announced Wednesday.
These are located at the site of the ancient city of Abydos, more than 300 miles south of Cairo, said Josef Wegner, a Penn associate professor of Egyptology.
It appears to have been raided by tomb robbers in ancient times, Wegner said.
The tombs of other members of the dynasty are thought to lie nearby.

The string of discoveries began last year when Wegner and others came across a 60-ton stone chamber.
Wegner and the others are still trying to figure out the king for whom it was reused.
The tombs of other members of his dynasty are thought to lie nearby.
At the time, several dynasties were fighting for power.

The FDA noted that trans fats in processed food have been shown to raise "bad" cholesterol, increasing the risk of heart disease.
Under new rules, the FDA has declared that partially hydrogenated oils are a food additive that is not "generally recognized as safe."
The new guidelines mean that companies that want to use the ingredient have to first seek approval from the FDA.
It also would prevent companies from claiming their food contains "zero grams trans fat" if the product has a half-gram or less per serving.
The FDA has opened a 60-day review period to take comments from the food industry and other experts.
California became the first state to make restaurants stop cooking with trans fats in 2008.
"If the serving size is small and you eat several servings, the amount of trans fats adds up," said Jennifer Ventrelle, a registered dietitian at Rush University Medical Center.
But additional information on the label says that preparing the dish by adding margarine and 2 percent reduced fat milk adds 4 grams of trans fat per serving.
Mondelez International, which makes Oreo cookies, Wheat Thins, Triscuits and Nilla Wafers, said all of its cookies and crackers are labeled as "zero grams trans fat" per serving.
General Mills, owner of brands Betty Crocker and Pillsbury, said that it has taken the trans fat out of more than 90 percent of its products sold in U.S. stores.
It would not affect the small amount of naturally occurring trans fat found in some meat and dairy products.
Trans fatty acids, or trans fats, are formed when food makers turn liquid oils into solid fats by adding hydrogen atoms.
But some Mondelez products still contain partially hydrogenated oil, according to the label.
Most major restaurant companies eliminated partially hydrogenated oils in the mid- to late-2000s, the Center for Science in the Public Interest said.
But a number of chains still have menu items that contain some partially hydrogenated oil.

In May 1995, geophysicist H. Jay Melosh attended a meeting of U.S. and ex-Soviet nuclear weapons designers.
First Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb, urged others meeting at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to consider building and orbiting huge, new nuclear weapons for planetary protection.
"It was a really bizarre thing to see that these weapons designers were willing to work together \u2014 to build the biggest bombs ever," said Melosh.
Bong Wie, the director of Iowa State University\'s Asteroid Deflection Research Center, said he has a grant from NASA to design a "hypervelocity nuclear interceptor system."
Keith Holsapple, an engineering professor at the University of Washington, said NASA has given him a grant to study how either an impact device or a nuclear explosion could deflect an Earth-bound asteroid from its path.
The leading U.S. supporter of the nuclear solution is probably David S.P.
"You fragment it with enough force so that the pieces spread out," and mostly miss the Earth, he said.
But shattering a large asteroid close to hitting Earth probably would require a weapon with a yield of about a megaton, or 1 million tons of TNT.
Mark Boslough, a physicist at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, has studied the possible effects of nuclear blasts on asteroids.
So there is time to find suitable, non-nuclear alternatives \u2014 such as hitting asteroids with rams, zapping them with lasers, tugging them off a kamikaze trajectory, or deflecting them with solar sails.
A Sept. 16 announcement cited "defense from asteroids" as one possible area of study.
In May 1995, physicist H. Jay Melosh attended an unusual meeting.
He urged others meeting at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to consider building and orbiting huge, new nuclear weapons for planetary protection.
Weapons experts in the United States and Russia say the asteroid threat is a reason to hold onto \u2014 or to build \u2014 very large nuclear bombs.
If the collision was still at least 10 years away, a nuclear blast could knock the asteroid off course.
But shattering a large asteroid probably would require a weapon with a yield of about a megaton, or 1 million tons of TNT.
Ninety percent of the biggest asteroids already have been found and ruled out as a near-term threat, he says.
For nuclear bombs to work even as a last-ditch effort, he said, they would need to be more powerful than any ever built.

A lot more people, he warned, have been killed by nuclear weapons than by asteroids.
Will the next egg you eat come from a chicken raised in a roomier barn?
Since California passed a measure requiring more space for egg-laying hens in 2008, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Michigan and Ohio have enacted laws regulating hen housing.
A 2010 law expanded Proposition 2 to apply to all eggs sold in the state, which consumes roughly twice as many eggs as it produces.
The shift has driven up costs and widened the difference between wholesale prices in California and other markets, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The gap between California and New York, for example, rose to $1 a dozen in January, from a 12-cent difference in October 2014, according to the USDA.
Klippen said the egg industry will fight efforts to extend cage-free regulations.
"The McDonald\'s announcement really settles the debate as to whether there will be a future for cage confinement in the egg industry \u2014 the answer is no, there won\'t be," said Paul Shapiro.
Hickman, like other West-Coast producers already selling eggs in California, has been moving toward roomier enclosures since Proposition 2 passed in 2008.
California has since issued a rule requiring about 116 square inches per bird.
Big egg producers in the Midwest also have shifted production.
This week, the average wholesale price for a dozen white, large eggs was around $2.40 in California, up by $1.26 from this time last year, according to the USDA.
The nationwide average was $1.78, up about 82 cents from the same period last year.
He said McDonald\'s bowed to "a small group of consumers, who are sort of the animal activists."
The next egg you eat may come from a chicken raised in a roomier barn.
Since then, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Michigan and Ohio have passed laws regulating hen housing.
The Arizona egg producer responded to the announcement with plans to build a modern, 2-million-hen facility.
California has since issued a rule requiring about 116 square inches per bird.
Before the law passed, Hickman housed several million chickens in stacked wire enclosures.

USANNE, Switzerland \u2013 In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, have filled the imagination and the nightmares of people around the world.
But the use of drones in the lower sky is here to stay.
In rich countries, early interest in cargo drones has focused on the so-called last mile.
One reason to favor cargo drones is precisely that they fly in remote regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America where poverty and disease are pervasive, distances are great and roads will never be built.
USANNE, Switzerland \u2013 Around the world, people are getting excited about drones, but fear them at the same time.
By flying to many of these communities, cargo drones can save lives and create jobs.
So why be hopeful about cargo drones?

At nearly 2,600 square miles, it is home to just 6,000 people and accessible from the mainland only by boat or plane.
Yet the wolf population in that area has been in steady decline, and cutting down more trees is expected to pressure them further.
Meanwhile, logging continues, as does hunting, of both wolves and the deer that are their food supply.
Climate change has made the battles more complicated, raising questions about which species should be priorities and whether they can even be saved.
The timber industry in southeast Alaska is a fraction of what it used to be before federal regulations began limiting old-growth logging in the 1990s.
Mills on Prince of Wales were built to cut larger, older trees.
The mill on Prince of Wales is viewed as important because it provides year-round work, while logging jobs are seasonal.
"There\'s got to be a way to transition this small number of people and communities in a way that makes sense, instead of just totally trashing this species and this ecosystem," said Larry Edwards.
The story of the wolves, the island and the ancient forest in Alaska began a long time ago.
This spring, with the approval of the U.S. Forest Service, loggers began cutting thousands of acres of old-growth evergreens in Tongass National Forest in Prince of Wales Island in Alaska.
Just 20 years ago, Prince of Wales was home to about 300 wolves.
The timber industry in southeast Alaska is a fraction of what it was before new federal regulations began limiting old-growth logging in the 1990s.
There are fewer than 300 logging and sawmill jobs in the region, compared with the 3,500 workers two decades ago.
While the industry has shrunk, others, including tourism and fishing, have grown.

Most coral reefs in temperate climates can only withstand temperatures as high as 29 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit) before they expel the algae living in their tissue.
Still, most scientists say climate change poses the biggest threat in the future.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned that warming waters could lead to a global bleaching event in 2015 \u2014 the third one in the past two decades.
I think we are now getting to this idea that actually, in some cases, these mechanisms can arise very quickly, within a few years."
In theory, if symbionts exist elsewhere, then corals faced with bleaching could switch them on as temperatures rise.
"That could compensate for the some of the warming we are expecting to see this century," Baker says.
Such doubts have done little to dampen the enthusiasm for using genes from the Persian Gulf reefs in future conservation strategies.
The reintroduced corals might not even cope well with new environmental conditions.
Still, most scientists say climate change is the biggest threat in the future.
"It\'s not all doom and gloom for corals," marine biologist Andrew Baker says.
People still have those concerns, but they can see that it\'s important to develop the tools and to (see) what is actually possible."
Still, most scientists say climate change is the biggest threat in the future.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned that warming waters could lead to a global bleaching event in 2015.

Unfortunately, these genetic changes are not happening as fast as the Earth is warming.
He and his peers discovered a new type of algae that can handle warmer water.
Researchers are not sure whether it was evolution or if the algae was brought in from outside the region by currents.
Some experts think researchers would be better off looking for answers in regions with milder climates.

They still want to keep looking for ways to use the new algae to help coral in other places.
There has also been more emphasis on packaging that allows milk to be kept unrefrigerated on a store shelf, much like a juice box.
"We can\'t just put a gallon of milk on a shelf and hope someone buys it," she said.
Among those partners is Dairy Farmers of America, which represents thousands of farmers nationwide.
According to her, it is essential for the dairy industry to create new products, such as flavored milk and dairy-based sports drinks.
The change could mean that millions more gallons of milk will be sold.

More than 1 out of 3 American children and teens will eat fast food today.
Children from poor families counted on fast food for 11.5 percent of their daily calories, on average.
This can be compared with 11.2 percent of Latinos, 13.1 percent of whites and 13.9 percent of African-Americans.
The other important difference had to do with age.
Overall, children between ages 2 and 11 were much less likely than teens, ages 12 to 19, to eat fast food.

For years, chocolate lovers have been comforted by the fact that bittersweet dark chocolate seems to improve cardiovascular health.
What they found was that after cocoa was "digested," long molecules called polyphenolic polymers remained within the gut.
"They serve to prevent or delay the onset of some forms of cardiovascular disease that are associated with inflammation."
One of the issues involving dark chocolate, Finley said, was the amount of sugar and fat that chocolate candy contains.

Now it is his greatest ambition to start a farm \u2014 but not in China, a country where the word "farmer" is synonymous with "peasant."
"Throughout Chinese history, our land was never enough," said Tian Zhihong, a professor of international agriculture.

City officials in Napa had long worried that the grand building on the corner of Second and Brown streets could be devastated by a major earthquake.
The work was completed years ago on the 104-year-old Alexandria.
Many cities have laws requiring owners to retrofit their brick buildings.
Mortar can break down over time and grow so weak that the bricks can begin to slide.
There are more costly ways to better retrofit brick buildings, such as adding concrete or glue-like polymers to the brick walls or installing diagonal braces.
But most cities require less-strict, less-costly rules.
Based on photos of the building, David Cocke, president of Structural Focus, an earthquake retrofit company, said it appeared the mortar between the bricks had been in poor condition.
"If the shaking is strong enough, it could still result in a dangerous situation.
And no owner is going to spend the money to come in and make that particular building as strong as a hospital."
Owner Kim Erasmy said the building was retrofitted before she bought it in 2002, but now city officials told her the building may be too unstable for her to go in.
City officials in Napa had long worried that the grand, historic Alexandria Square building could be devastated by a major earthquake.
"We can\'t keep every single brick in place in many of these older buildings without extraordinarily costly retrofits," said Fred Turner, an engineer with the California Seismic Safety Commission.

American Indians across the Western U.S. are fighting to protect the grizzly bears that are so meaningful to their culture.
Ben Nuvamsa, a former chairman of Arizona\'s Hopi Tribe, says his people view the grizzly as an "uncle" who possesses strong healing powers and plays a central role in traditional ceremonies.

American Indian tribes in the Western United States are fighting to protect grizzly bears.
The tribes are concerned hunters will kill the bears, which they believe are sacred.
U.S. wildlife officials, and wildlife officials for the states of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, say the 700 to 1,000 bears in the region are not endangered.

Veronica Zaragoza has seen everything in this fertile agricultural region change, except her wages.
Zaragoza, a mother of three, was held in a field surrounded by police for 17 hours before being released.
Their defenders say that the wages they offer are higher than in other Mexican farming regions.
"Our primary focus continues to be toward the well-being of our employees," it said.
But produce picker Bernardo Velasco, 47, said his family lives in harsh conditions.
Zaragoza said she saw protesters thrown to the ground and hit by police.
Contracts already exist between the growers and the unions that represent the farmworkers.
He hoped that an agreement would let them go around union bosses and let the pickers deal directly with their employers.
Veronica Zaragoza grew up picking berries and tomatoes in this fertile region just south of the United States.

Farmworker leaders met with government officials and leaders of the food companies on Thursday.
In a statement, BerryMex said it has been committed to "fairness, honesty and respect for all" of its workers.

Veronica Zaragoza grew up picking berries and tomatoes in this fertile region just south of the United States.
It is just a little more than when she started picking as a 13-year-old.
Pickers stood shoulder to shoulder to block the main highway.
Hundreds of police and army soldiers cleared away the crowds with rubber bullets and tear gas.
Farmworkers are seeking higher pay and health care.
On Thursday afternoon, dozens of police officers kept watch on hundreds of people gathered outside a government building.
Alberto Munoz, a lawyer representing the growers, said it would be difficult to change conditions for workers, like pay.
Union leaders, though, are often seen as more on the side of the business owners than on the side of the farmworkers.

Farmworker leaders met with government officials and leaders from the farm companies on Thursday.
The protests started peacefully but turned angry.
Some of the farmworkers want to go around the unions.
They want to deal with the farm owners themselves.
All it would do is create hundreds of millions of dollars of extra handling costs that would get passed on, driving up the price at grocery stores.
"It\'s just consumer information, the same kind of information that\'s on a label of a new car that says where an engine\'s from."
Last month, the Canadian government said the new rules discriminated against foreign competition.
Ottawa said it might respond by imposing tariffs on a long list of products, including pork, pasta, chocolate, cheese, office furniture and many more.
For consumer groups, labeling has become the dispute that never goes away, even though it wins strong backing in polls.
"I thought we were done with it, and all of a sudden it\'s still going on," said Chris Waldrop of the Consumer Federation of America.
"This is just another effort to do that, but the public is not on their side on this."
Under the new rules, the labels will provide information detailing what countries the animals were born in, and where they were raised and slaughtered.
But Joseph, whose Made in the USA Foundation urged the USDA to pass the new rules, said labeling is both a health and safety concern for American consumers, who put more faith in U.S. products.
"We don\'t want beef to become a luxury item," said McCan, a fifth-generation rancher.
Backers of the new rules, who say labeling can be done at a small cost, are ready for another battle with cattle producers.
"They\'re totally wrong \u2014 consumers have the right to know where products are from," said Joel Joseph, chairman of the Los Angeles-based Made in the USA Foundation.
The new labeling rules also could ignite a trade war with Canada, which is threatening to fight back.
Canada said it might respond by putting tariffs on a long list of U.S. products, including pork, pasta, chocolate, cheese, office furniture and many more.
Under the new rules, the labels will provide information about what countries the animals were born in, raised and slaughtered.
McCan said he has long included cattle from Mexico in his business.

Labeling has become difficult for the Agriculture Department.
Under the new rules, the labels will provide information about what countries the animals were born in, raised and slaughtered.
The WTO hears trade fights between countries.
The rules would mean that the country where the cattle came from has to be included on beef packages.
Canada complained to the World Trade Organization.
They accused the government of dragging its feet on putting new rules in place.
His ranch is just three hours from Mexico.
If the beef has to be labeled, he has to split up the animals when he sells them.
The rules would mean that the country where the cattle came from has to be included on beef packages.
If McCan does not want to have to split up his cattle, "then he shouldn\'t get cattle from Mexico," he said.
The new labeling rules also could start a fight with Canada.
Cattle from Mexico is heavily tested and treated.
But Joseph said labeling is both a health and safety concern for Americans.
U.S. food is safer and cleaner, he added.
The immigration debate has focused on how a bill now in Congress might affect about 11 million people who entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas.
Activists who spoke to their lawyer said that they were denied humanitarian parole, and that immigration officials would consider their request for asylum while holding them in Florence.
They hope to keep a connection to their pasts without fear of losing their futures in the U.S. With Mateo were Marco Saavedra, 23, of New York and Lulu Martinez, 24, of Chicago.
As word spread, as many as 30 more young people showed up at the border, but their status was not clear.
Saavedra once occupied an immigration facility in Florida, and was detained.
Wearing graduation caps and gowns, Mateo, Saavedra and Martinez chanted "undocumented, unafraid" as they walked Monday from Nogales, Sonora, to Nogales, Ariz. Five other immigrants came along, also dressed for graduation.
Under a reform package backed by the Obama administration, young immigrants deported could apply to return to the U.S.

She was protesting the thousands of people deported in the last five years as the government tries to reform and enforce immigration.
They asked to come in legally across the border they had crossed in secret and avoided most of their lives.
The group on Monday grew quickly.
They want to stay connected to their past without fear of losing their futures in the U.S. With Mateo were Marco Saavedra, 23, of New York and Lulu Martinez, 24, of Chicago.
He returned to Mexico in 2011 because he thought immigration reform would never happen, and he regrets that now.

In the spring of 1920, President Woodrow Wilson had suffered a stroke.
He confided in his good friend, the White House doctor, Cary T. Grayson: "My personal pride must not be allowed to stand in the way of my duty to the country.

These simple lifeforms, called chemolithoautotrophs, feed on chemicals found in rocks and make their own energy.
"Ancient Mars was more habitable than we imagined," said California Institute of Technology geologist John Grotzinger.
This wet, potentially Earth-like environment could have lasted for tens of millions of years.
"They\'re really quite amazing," said Malcolm Walters, an astrobiologist at the University of New South Wales in Australia who helped find some of the earliest fossils on Earth.
But rather than head straight to Mount Sharp, the rover took a months-long detour to an interesting spot called Yellowknife Bay.
There, Curiosity drilled into two rocks, named John Klein and Cumberland.
Life could certainly evolve and thrive without this organic carbon.
That said, scientists do want to find organic carbon because it would mean that the planet once had a wider range of life-friendly places.
So Farley directed Curiosity to analyze several soil samples and found gases that helped pin down the age of the Martian surface.
If any organic carbon exists in Gale Crater, the foot of one of these cliffs would be the best place to search for it, the scientists believed.
"You just never know what you\'ll encounter," said NASA scientist Douglas Ming, who led the study.
They feed on chemicals found in rocks and make their own energy.
It was a risk to turn away from the planned mission, but it paid off, Grotzinger said.
That meant the amount of radiation exposure was also lower than they had expected.
That meant the amount of damage to the soil was also lower than they had expected.
"One thing I\'ve come to expect, doing Mars research, is to expect the unexpected," Ming said.
Scientists now believe there could once have been life on Mars.

This wet, Earth-like environment could have lasted for tens of millions of years.
The rocks, dated to roughly 3.6 billion years ago, contain lots of the chemicals needed for life.
That meant the amount of radiation exposure was also lower than they had expected.
So the scientists plan to take this information and run with it.

He said it could have been easy for simple animals to live on Mars.
"They\'re really quite amazing," said Malcolm Walters, who works at a university in Australia.
It first visited an interesting spot called Yellowknife Bay.
The rover has not yet found any carbon.
This would have also destroyed any carbon that was once there.
Then the Curiosity rover took soil samples.
But, one thing he knows from studying Mars, "is to expect the unexpected," Ming said.
In the Gulf of Mexico, Dariel Alvarez was afraid he might die.
He left knowing he might never see his family again.
He left without saying goodbye to several friends.
Alvarez waited more than year for his unblocking license.
Showalter has high hopes for Alvarez and thinks he could play in the major leagues.
"Honestly, I would have taken whatever they would have offered me, because I wanted to play baseball."
Canedo, who Alvarez said immigrated from Cuba legally, is working to become an American citizen.
It is against the law for Cubans to leave their country.

Every year, about 1,000 babies are born in the United States with half a heart.', u'The rare defect requires a series of risky surgeries and, even then, leaves the infants with the likelihood that their hearts will wear out prematurely.
If it works, the new technique could buy these children time as scientists scramble for a cure for the birth defect called hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).
It could also pave the way for additional breakthroughs in stem cell treatments that would help the 19,000 children born each year with other heart defects.
Ava Grace Weitl was born on May 8, 2012, then whisked away for her first surgery.
Nelson said he thinks stem cells taken from umbilical cord blood and placed into a growing heart will work even better.
He said it tore him up to know that babies who endured three surgeries would often return as young children with heart damage that could not be fixed and little chance  of finding a donor heart in time to save them.
About 1,000 babies are born every year in the United States with half a heart.
"We\'re really here to make a difference in children\'s lives who are living today with unmet needs," said Dr. Timothy Nelson, director of Mayo\'s HLHS research program.
DeShaw and her husband, Brad Weitl, sought help from the Mayo Clinic for their baby.
They learned that children born with defects on the left side of the heart must have three complicated surgeries.
"We wanted to participate, not only because we thought that at some point Ava might benefit, but we also wanted to help all the other babies," DeShaw said.
About 1,000 babies are born every year in the United States with half a heart.
Stem cells can grow different types of organs.
Within a few days of birth, surgeons rebuild the heart so that the right ventricle can do both its own work and the work of the broken left ventricle.
About nine of 10 at Mayo live.
Nelson said he thinks stem cells taken from blood from the umbilical cord and put into a growing heart will work even better.
Also, Nelson said, stem cells from the umbilical cord seem to know when to stop making heart cells.
He was saddened that babies had to go through three surgeries and would often return as young children with heart damage that could not be fixed and little chance of finding a new heart in time to save them.
But there are also some living into their early 20s.
Nelson decided he wanted to find a cure for HLHS when he was studying to become a heart surgeon for children.
But the doctors at Mayo are focused on babies who need the most help now.
She even went back to Mayo in a helicopter once.
Ava Grace was born on May 8, 2012.
Ava stayed at the hospital until September.
But she has had many problems since she went home.
The stem cells get put into the heart during the second operation.
Then the children usually could not find a new heart in time to save them.
A modest change in what food labels say about sweeteners should not have been that controversial.
The proposal being considered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would add a new line to labels on packaged food products.
The FDA has received 287,889 public comments on the plan, many of them from major food companies and trade associations.
Sugar is sugar, and no evidence justifies singling out one type for added labeling, they say.
"Consumers already have the information they need to make healthy dietary choices," the Dairy Institute of California wrote.
"Such information could confuse consumers by taking their focus off of calories," it wrote to the agency.
Another of the dozens of companies calling on the FDA to cancel the sugar plan is the Roman Meal Company, which makes whole-grain breads.
That included most deli meats on supermarket shelves.
But for advocacy groups, the aim is to get companies to lower the sugar content of their products.
A minor plan to change what food labels say about sugar has stirred up a big food fight.
The governor of Massachusetts asked the Obama administration to rethink its proposal.
The governor of Wisconsin has protested too.

Right now, food labels give the total amount of sugar in an item.
The number includes the sugars already in a food and the amount that is added.
He wrote that science does not show a reason for the extra sugar labeling.
The sugar details could confuse people, it wrote to the FDA.
Foods with too many calories make people gain weight, but so does sugar.
It found nearly 3 out of 5 had extra sugar added.
Google is getting into the car business and is hoping to turn drivers into passengers.
"We\'ve been working toward the goal of vehicles that can shoulder the entire burden of driving," Google wrote on its blog.
The company said that software will "improve road safety and help people who can\'t drive."
California law is expected to allow self-driving cars on public roads by the end of this year.
"We\'re going to learn a lot from this experience, and if the technology develops as we hope, we\'ll work with partners to bring this technology into the world safely," Google said.
Users could take the cars when they need them for short trips around town.
Change may happen faster than people think.
Many automakers expect they will have fully self-driving cars on the road by 2020.

Their hands fly with the speed and skill of veteran assembly-line workers.
Many of these workers are not yet teenagers, but they fill the dimly lit textile mills and warehouses here in Surat \u2014 an industrial city in western India.
Advocacy groups say the proposal could actually push more youngsters into the workforce, jeopardizing their education and putting them at greater risk of exploitation.
Government surveys, though, show that many child workers in Surat are migrants from poorer states.
"If this practice gets legal cover, child labor might actually increase," he said.
The earlier labor laws in India banned children under 14 from working only in 18 hazardous industries.

Boluo saw thousands of people march through the streets Saturday, with some returning Sunday, to protest a planned garbage incinerator.
In April, hundreds of residents in Maoming, another city in Guangdong province, clashed with police over a planned paraxylene factory.
In May, a protest of a planned waste incinerator in Hangzhou, south of Shanghai, also turned into a fight.
He said new incinerators in China operate at or above European Union standards for limiting dioxins and other pollutants.
Others, however, say the government has been less than transparent and honest in monitoring emissions from big waste burners.
"There has been little release of public data, so it is hard to know if the incinerators are being operated safely," said Lin Youzhu.
By the end of 2013, according to Lin, 176 waste incinerators were operating in China.
The government "pays little attention to reducing waste at the source and puts all its attention into disposal," she said.

An Internet video of six young Iranian men and women dancing to Pharrell Williams\' "Happy" has led to their arrests.
As recently as Saturday, Rouhani voiced a moderate view about the Internet, which remains tightly regulated by Iranian authorities.
They accuse Rouhani of showing leniency and too much tolerance toward those who question Islamic sanctities or women who are not veiled enough.
Tehran Police Chief Hossein Sajedinia confirmed the arrests on state TV last Tuesday in a report that blurred images from the video and then showed the six with their backs turned toward the camera.
Iranian media in the past quoted Rouhani as saying the account is his.
While Rouhani pursues a policy of social and cultural openness, hard-liners say the government should be tough on those who challenge interpretations of Islamic norms.
Laws in the Islamic Republic ban women from dancing in public or appearing outside without covering their hair with the hijab.
The TV report blurred images from the video and then showed the six with their backs turned toward the camera.
An Internet video of six young Iranian men and women dancing to the hit pop song "Happy" by Pharrell Williams appeared on YouTube.
"We should see the cyber world as an opportunity," Rouhani told the official Iranian news agency.
Fans have posted similar videos from around the world, showing people dancing down streets.
The government also blocks some websites.
Yet, it stopped short of mentioning them directly.
Sites such as YouTube and Facebook are blocked by the government.
However, many young Iranians use workarounds to bypass the controls.
Last week, hard-liners marched over women dressing provocatively and not wearing the hijab, a veil that covers the hair.

As 10-year-old Wesley Pope bombed down a snow-packed hill one afternoon, his father Russell smiled.
After a mostly snowless winter, the Overland Park, Kansas, man enjoyed finally getting to go sledding with his children.
Omaha prohibited sledding at a popular hill as a test after settling its lawsuit, but allowed it again after residents ignored the ban.
In most states \u2014 including Missouri and Kansas \u2014 laws shield cities from being held responsible for injuries resulting from sledding.
The question is whether a city could foresee a risk, Lawson said.
Meanwhile, back on the Overland Park sledding hill, 11-year-old Lydia Pope frowned at the idea of a sledding ban.

Other cities \u2014 including Des Moines, Iowa; Montville, New Jersey; Lincoln, Nebraska; and Columbia City, Indiana \u2014 have taken less extreme measures.
Cities have been successfully taken to court and sued for millions of dollars following sledding injuries.
In Omaha, Nebraslka, $2.4 million went to the family of a 5-year-old who became paralyzed after her sled hit a tree.
The fear of such lawsuits is behind the movement to ban or limit sledding.
However, for some cities, banning sledding is not easy.

Four California high schools will have two years to pick a new school mascot.
"This landmark legislation eliminating the R-word in California schools clearly demonstrates that this issue is not going away, and that opposition to the Washington team on this issue is only intensifying.

The label would read: "STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAFETY WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay."
"The goal of the warning quite simply is to give consumers the right to know what are well-established medical impacts from consuming these beverages," Monning said in a telephone interview.
CalBev, the California arm of the American Beverage Association, noted that the industry already posts calorie counts on the front of many beverage containers.
But it called Monning\'s bill "misleading" because it said just 6 percent of calories in the average American\'s diet come from soda, fruit, sports and energy drinks, compared with 11 percent from sweets and deserts.
The group would not put a price tag on complying with the proposed legislation, but said the measure would increase the cost of doing business in California.
The warning labels would mesh with health campaigns and proposed laws in several California cities and elsewhere to discourage sugar consumption.
Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg unsuccessfully pushed proposals to tax soda and ban the sale of large soda containers.
Sodas and other sugary drinks will have to bear warning labels to be sold in California under a new proposal.

When is it safe to play tackle football?
The researchers found that the players who had started playing football before age 12 performed an average of 20 percent worse on tests than those who had started after their 12th birthday.

On all three tests, the players who had started playing tackle football earlier in life performed worse than the others.
He said that his research team chose the age of 12 as the dividing line because it is an important time for the brain.
Studies often try to draw conclusions about the general population by looking at a sample group.
It is possible, though, that the sample group will be different from the general population.
Given this difference, the results of the study may not apply to all kids.

Overfishing threatens whole species," Obama said in statement to an international conference on ocean policy.
But he said Pew estimates that about 1 percent to 3 percent of the U.S. annual tuna catch would be affected by the plan.
"Because our seafood travels through an increasingly long, complex and non-transparent supply chain, there are numerous opportunities for seafood fraud to occur and illegally caught fish to enter the U.S. market," said Beth Lowell.
Under the plan, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would get $9 million over three years to better monitor the local effect of ocean acidification.', u'This, in turn, could help individual coastal communities.
We\'ll be cutting off one of the world\'s major sources of food and economic growth," the president said.
The proposal doubles the area of ocean protected by the United States, environmental groups said.

The president of the Boy Scouts of America urged the organization Thursday to accept gay Scout leaders.
He suggested steps to avert what could be a threat to the existence of the century-old organization.
The Scouts have held fast to the ban over the years, even as homosexuality and same-sex marriage have increasingly come to be accepted by the American public.
Officials with the National Catholic Committee on Scouting said Thursday they were not yet ready to make a statement.
Attorneys have been in touch with others like her in Ohio, Oklahoma and elsewhere, said Josh Schiller, a partner in the firm.
But the many recent state and local laws explicitly banning discrimination against gays would strengthen legal cases against the Scouts now, Schiller said.
"We\'re very hopeful that the result of Robert Gates\' statement today means that the Boy Scouts are truly looking forward and not backward," Schiller said.
Objections to the policy have come not only from outside the Scouts but from within it as well.
In his remarks Thursday, Gates said for the first time that the Scouts would not take action against local councils that have hired gay leaders.
The Boy Scouts should allow gay adults as leaders, its president said.
Next month, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide whether same-sex couples can marry.
"The one thing we cannot do is put our heads in the sand and pretend this challenge will go away," Gates said.
The Boy Scouts should allow gay adults as leaders, its president said.
It permitted China to purchase 62 tons of stockpiled ivory from Botswana, South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
"The United States and China commit to enact nearly complete bans on ivory import and export, including significant and timely restrictions on the import of ivory as hunting trophies, and to take significant and timely steps to halt the domestic commercial trade of ivory," the White House announced at the time.
The two countries will cooperate in "joint training, technical exchanges, information sharing, and public education on combating wildlife trafficking, and enhance international law enforcement cooperation in this field," the White House statement said.
"I feel this is a political decision, but it is definitely a step in the right direction," said Grace Gabriel, director of the Asia office of the International Fund for Animal Welfare.
Experts say that one potential snag is the lack of a similar ban in Hong Kong.

For the past four years, the $600 million Kepler has been a prolific planet detector from its lonely orbit, fixing its meter-wide lens on stars to detect the subtle dimming that occurs every time a planet passes in front of its sun.
We really wanted to go the next mile to nail down an Earth and to tell if there are moons," he said.
There are more improvements to be made," Petigura said.
"The signals are there, in the data we have now \u2014 we have to search for them," said NASA\'s William Borucki, the Kepler mission\'s principal investigator.
For the past four years, the $600 million Kepler has been focusing its lens on stars to detect the subtle dimming that occurs every time a planet passes in front of its sun.
The project has been a runaway success, changing our view of the universe.
For instance, other signals can masquerade as a transiting planet, and stars naturally fluctuate in brightness.
Kepler would have collected so much data that signs of an Earth-like planet would have been easily confirmed if the spacecraft lasted until it ran out of fuel in 2019, the researchers said.
"We\'ll work with what we have," said Alan Gould at the University of California, Berkeley.
"We haven\'t seen the most interesting data," said Natalie Batalha, deputy science team leader for the Kepler mission.
The extended mission, with extra transits, would have told us that."
The pressure is on such computer experts as Erik Petigura, an astronomy graduate student who works  to process the data.
The project has been a big success, changing our view of the universe.
Most recently, it revealed some planets circling in the right orbit around stars Kepler 62 and 69.

Jose Torres loves mariachi.
A magnet school often attracts students from far and wide with special interests and talents.
The programs were introduced by the Mariachi Heritage Foundation, a group that brings mariachi to Chicago public schools.
She has noticed how interested parents are in the mariachi program.
Mariachi songs can be fast or slow and come from various regions of Mexico.
He bought 450 violins with the money, and in January he hopes to buy more mariachi instruments and expand to seven other schools.
The traditional Mexican folk music is being taught in dozens of areas nationwide in cities including Las Vegas, San Antonio, Texas, and Tucson, Arizona.

Scientists have identified deposits of an unusual material known as "impact glass" on Mars, with the help of a NASA Mars orbiter.
Unlike the glass we encounter in daily life, this material is dark brown, almost black, and only partly transparent.
Scientists identify different types of rocks on Mars by picking out the unique spectral "fingerprints" these materials leave in sunlight reflected off the planet.
Therefore, their spectral signatures in reflected light are stronger than the signatures of partially see-through materials like impact glass, explains Briony Horgan, a planetary scientist at Purdue University.
Consequently, signals from any rocks that might be mixed in with the impact glass could block out signals from the glass.
Cannon overcame this obstacle by making his own artificial Martian impact glass.
By measuring the spectral signal of this imitation impact glass, Cannon and Mustard, a professor of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown, knew precisely what to look for on the Martian surface.
"I can state with a pretty high level of confidence that this new study is the first clear detection of impact glass on Mars," Horgan said.
The leaves were preserved down to the cellular level.
"There is no proof that there ever was life on Mars," says planetary scientist Kieren Howard of Kingsborough Community College of the City University of New York.
If Mars was once inhabited, however, the bits of life inside impact glass "might just allow for the reconstruction of ancient environments, like time capsules."
Impact glass is not only good for giving a snapshot of life in the blasting zone at the time of the impact; the glass itself can host tiny life-forms that move in after the dust has settled.
A group of organisms called chemolithoautotrophs can tunnel into the glass and live.
"These guys were thought to be some of the earliest types of life on Earth, and thought to be the types of microbes that might persist on other planets," says Haley Sapers of Western University in Ontario, Canada.
Although no actual chemolithoautotrophs have ever been sighted wriggling through impact glass on Earth, Sapers says there is strong evidence that they ate through the impact glass of a 15-million-year-old crater in Germany.
So if these tiny tunnels were found in the Martian glass, could that be evidence that the Red Planet was \u2014 or perhaps still is \u2014 home to alien life?
He then melted his mixture in an oven and allowed it to harden into fake impact glass.
Their search turned up a bunch of previously undetected glass deposits in craters across the Martian surface.
According to Schultz, impact glass might similarly capture and preserve bits of tiny life on Mars.
So, if these tiny tunnels were found in the Martian glass, could that be evidence that the Red Planet was \u2014 or perhaps still is \u2014 home to alien life?
Besides, Sapers says that detecting tunnels in the glass would require returning samples to Earth.

On Earth this same material has been shown to preserve evidence of ancient life that was trapped inside it.

He then melted his mixture in an oven and allowed it to harden into fake impact glass.
The detection of the impact glass on Mars is especially exciting.
Studies of similar glass on Earth have shown it can preserve traces of life that existed both before something hit the planet and after.

"These guys were thought to be some of the earliest types of life on Earth," said Haley Sapers of Western University in Ontario, Canada.
The acid allows them to dissolve the glass and consume nourishment, or nutrients, found in the glass.

One scientist said it was the first time impact glass was found on Mars.
It could mean impact glass on Mars might also hold bits of tiny life.
However, if there was once life on Mars, bits of life inside impact glass could let scientists figure out what the planet used to be like, he said.
They can dig into the glass and live.
Every summer, South Florida residents battle swarms of mosquitoes.
He believes his research shows the need to broaden insect safety testing for pesticides, which currently is done only on honeybees.
So far this year, Vasquez said the district has sprayed just once, at a half dozen parks, before the July 4 holiday.
Permethrin also tended to pose a lasting risk since it stayed on leaves longer.

Charity Edwards is unemployed, separated from her husband and raising four kids on a monthly income of $1,100.
She gets another $419 a month in food stamps to help feed her two girls, ages 6 and 11, and two boys, ages 15 and 17.
"There\'s not money left to buy clothes," said Edwards, 38, of Washington state.
Families who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches during the school year would get the money for summer food in electronic benefit transfer cards.
As part of her work, Murray is promoting smaller details, too: She wants poor kids to be able to eat more white potatoes, a big crop in her state.
"Less kids are buying school lunches and that undermines the intention to increase healthy eating in schools," said Republican Rep. Robert Aderholt of Alabama, chairman of a House of Representatives committee on agriculture spending.
After hosting a school meal debate in his home state last month, Aderholt said it was time "to hit the pause button" on new guidelines.
Murray said she was ready for the financial arguments but that she was banking on support for her hunger bill from Democrats and Republicans alike.
"My water bill is $80 a month, my gas bill is $200 a month, my electricity bill is $45 a month," Edwards said, adding that she\'s "in the middle of a really bad divorce" after being a stay-at-home mom since 2006.
She worried about the rising cost of meat after paying more than $20 for ground beef and bacon at the grocery store last week.

They fear it will get even more expensive with new guidelines backed by first lady Michelle Obama.
On Tuesday, the Agriculture Department said it would give "new flexibility" to schools by allowing them to serve traditional pasta instead of whole-grain for another two years.
In December, Republican Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia ignited a firestorm when he suggested requiring schoolchildren to sweep the floors before getting free lunches.
In March, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who ran for vice president in the 2012 elections, gave a speech in which he said the federal government was providing "a full stomach and an empty soul" to children who were getting free lunches.

Texas has long served students who were in the country illegally, and a 1982 Supreme Court case held that the state could not deny them an education.
Agency officials estimate that it will pay districts $9,473 to educate each ESL student this academic year.
If most of the young immigrants placed in Texas enroll in school, the total cost of educating them could top $50 million.
Those factors include the number of ESL students already in a school and the level of community programs and state support.
Also key is existing enrollment, Nolt said, adding that some districts in cities may have extra capacity.
Last year, only 150 young immigrants and refugees, who left their countries because of violence or war, started the school year at the Las Americas Newcomer Middle School.

Navy archaeologist Steve Schwartz was a leader of the project.
The archaeologist was especially shocked by a blunt question in the order: "Is the work you\'re doing out there legal?"
Concerned that the archaeological dig was breaking laws designed to protect cultural resources, he brought members of the Pechanga Native American tribe to the island.
In the early 1800s, the group suffered huge losses in repeated fights with Russian fur traders and Alaskan sea otter hunters.
After an especially brutal battle in 1814, the Nicoleno population, which had been about 300, dropped to a few dozen.

SHINGTON \u2013 The Federal government will be trying to sell wild horses at auction this weekend in Fort Worth, Texas.
These horses are related to the steeds of Spanish explorers, Native Americans, U.S. cavalry and ranch strays.
They argue that the government is really favoring the interests of ranchers whose cattle and sheep graze on the public lands.
The Bureau of Land Management pays the Mustang Heritage Foundation $3.75 million to train some of the wild horses and put them up for auction.
The foundation is holding another adoption at the John Justin Arena in Fort Worth, with 150 of the horses going for bid Friday and the same number on Sunday.
The Bureau has a board that advises it on wild horses.
It said the number of horses being held has gotten so big that it "threatens the health and welfare of the horses and the entire program."
The board recommended removing female reproductive organs of mares in the field to limit the number of horses.
It could also have vaccines to prevent pregnancies in horses if necessary, said Suzanne Roy, campaign director of the American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign.
A report on the wild horse problem is coming out next month and will heavily influence the debate.

The bureau is the agency in charge of 264 million acres across the United States.
At the same time, the cost to taxpayers has nearly doubled in the past four years to $75 million.
It will not kill healthy horses if nobody wants to adopt them, he said.
The bureau pays the Mustang Heritage Foundation $3.75 million to train some of the wild horses and put them up for auction.
SHINGTON \u2013 The Federal government will be trying to sell wild horses at an auction this weekend in Texas.
The government will not kill healthy horses if nobody wants to adopt them, he said.
The government pays a group $3.75 million to train some of the wild horses and put them up for auction.
It cannot figure out what else to do with them.
They  are related to the horses used by Spanish explorers, Native Americans and the cavalry.
The roundups have made wild horse supporters angry.
It says there are too many horses to survive on the wild land in the West.
The government pays a group $3.75 million to train some of the wild horses and put them up for auction.
The report will also talk about how the government decides how many horses can live on a piece of land.
If the bureau cannot find places for the horses, that could lead to some roundups.
Scientists say they have proved an important idea in evolution.
Will we someday live on a planet of giants?
Breathing becomes difficult because lungs need to be huge and work very well to keep supplying the air needed to support such large bodies.
"The fact that only one part of the bird lung was dark suggested the air was flowing in one direction," said Colleen Farmer, an associate professor of biology at the University of Utah.
She believes that further studies will prove that all lizards and snakes are also unidirectional breathers.
"Unidirectional breathing appears to be much more common and ancient than anyone thought," Farmer said in a statement.
Humans are just OK at taking the oxygen out of the air when they breathe.
The "old" air then moves out of our lungs along the same path it came in.
If pigeons breathed like humans do, scientists would have expected to find that the whole lung was black.
Humans are just OK at taking the oxygen out of the air when they breathe.
So Farmer worked out that this breathing could be important for mixing gases in the lungs when holding a breath.
"We\'re really looking forward" to seeing how much that changes, she said.
"Recently we had a woman say, \'I\'m thinking of doing a pie-in-your-face idea.\'"
Just a few years ago, she said, only one in two Americans knew what ALS is.
It was just a fun way to raise money for the fight against Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.
In many cases, it causes death within five years.
As it turned out, the ice bucket challenge has been incredibly successful.
Many are now trying to come up with other ways to connect with younger people online.
It has been very viral: that is, knowledge of it has spread rapidly, from person to person, on the Internet.
They challenge others to do the same \u2014 or to give money to the ALS Association.
The ice bucket challenge, Gilbert said, is "a very simple thing and that\'s kind of the beauty of it.
The station has released 66 apple varieties over more than a century, including Cortland, Macoun and two new entries at farm markets this fall: SnapDragon and RubyFrost.
But researchers also want farmer-friendly apples that hold up well against insects, fire blight and apple scab, and during shipping.
A green apple that might have been able to compete with the Granny Smith was discarded because it tended to develop blister spots.
Brown has high hopes for their two new apples, developed in partnership with the members of New York Apple Growers, which will initially be sold at dozens of farm markets in New York this fall.
As picking season for SnapDragon dawns, Brown is already thinking of the next-generation apple.
But researchers also want farmer-friendly apples that hold up well against insects, fire blight and apple scab.
Research assistant Kevin Maloney says about 95 percent of the seedlings they plant are rejected.
As picking season for the SnapDragon begins, Brown is already thinking of the next-generation apple.
Brown has high hopes for two new apples that will be sold at dozens of farm markets in New York this fall.

Brown has high hopes for two new apples that will be sold at dozens of farm markets in New York this fall.
The orchard is part of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station.
A green apple that tasted delicious also had to be dropped because it developed blister spots.
RubyFrost is high in vitamin C. It also resists browning, which is important now that apple slices have become popular in stores and restaurants.
One promising type was rejected because many of its leaves turned spotty.
Both apples will be sold at dozens of farm markets in New York this fall.
There are waxy apples, deep-red apples, round apples, egg-shaped apples.
On a sunny day this week, she walked through rows of her apple trees.
Another was unusually firm and crisp.
They must hold up well against insects and tree diseases.
A green apple that tasted delicious also had to be dropped: It developed blister spots.
Scientists try to add together the good parts of two different kinds of apples: say, the sweetness of one and the way another holds up against insects.

MLB offered to pay witnesses to help gather evidence against players suspected of cheating.
The case also caught All-Stars Nelson Cruz, Jhonny Peralta and Everth Cabrera.
Some are calling the punishments the most sweeping since the 1919 Black Sox scandal, which involved a scheme to rig the World Series.
They chose to admit responsibility, sit out their suspensions immediately, and return as quickly as possible to the diamond.
It is possible that Rodriguez and other players could be made to testify before a grand jury, if the case rises to that level.

MLB says he kept using testosterone and human growth hormone, however.
Weiner said Selig did not "act appropriately\'\' in his case.
Twelve other players were given 50-game punishments.
The announcement by the League on Monday ended a long look into Biogenesis.
He did not answer questions about his use of drugs.
The suspension could end his career.
Government lawyers in Miami said last week that they were looking into Biogenesis.
His high school coach said it was a sad day.

The portrait of the strong-jawed man in profile wearing a proud Native American war bonnet was undeniably arresting.
The picture appeared on the July cover of fashion magazine Elle UK, which was published June 5.
It claimed it had persuaded the singer to "trade his Vivienne Westwood mountie hat for a Native American feather headdress in his best ever shoot."
In the age of social media, the anger lights up faster and with more passion.
In June, headdresses made headlines during a San Francisco Giants baseball game, on Native American Heritage Night.
After the mainstream attention and online discussions, the Giants added "culturally insensitive" garb to offensive language, abusive behavior and other misdeeds that can get fans thrown out of the stadium.
Schilling adds, "It\'s not like I\'m mad at these people.
Hundreds of Native American dancers and drummers from across the country travel to Mayetta, north of Topeka, Kansas, for the event.
But he tends to give artists like Williams and others a pass.
Singer and songwriter Pharrell Williams looked striking in his portrait.
Critics on Twitter used the hashtag "#NotHappy," a snarky reference to the "Happy" singer\'s monster hit.
Headdresses have deep meaning for Native Americans.
"Social media of native people, even though we\'re only 2 percent (of the U.S. population), is so strong ... that our presence is making change," Schilling said.
For years, "the only voice we had was to go out and hold up a sign and say we\'re frustrated.
Security guards stepped in after a Native American man and woman approached a group of nonnative men who had brought a fake, plastic headdress to the game.
He saw so many recent examples of headdresses being used inappropriately that he made a YouTube video last fall called "What Is Native American Misappropriation?"
He begins: "What we\'re seeing now is ... what people are calling native hipsters.
So for a person to wear a war bonnet who didn\'t earn it would be the exact same thing as somebody wearing a Purple Heart or Medal of Honor who did not earn it."
"As Native Americans we are living in a dominant society, a society dominated by nonnatives, and it\'s going to be like that for a long time."
Singer Pharrell Williams looked stunning in his photo.
Schilling begins: "What we\'re seeing now is ... what people are calling native hipsters.
"Each of those feathers was earned and shows their position of leadership," Zotigh said.
It\'s like "the modern warrior who earns a medal for their service during wartime," Zotigh said.
"For a person to wear a war bonnet who didn\'t earn it would be the exact same thing as somebody wearing a Medal of Honor who did not earn it."
Singer and songwriter Pharrell Williams looked striking in his portrait.
But Williams is not, as far as anyone knew, Native American.
The photograph appeared on the July cover of fashion magazine Elle UK, which was published June 5.
Now, hurtful acts go viral.

group is calling on the NCAA to adopt a rule that would require schools to interview a candidate of color for all head coaching and leadership positions.
That includes all four teams that made it to the playoffs \u2014 Alabama, Clemson, Oklahoma and Michigan State.
He named it after Robinson, the revered coach at Grambling State who died in 2007\\.
Lapchick called the endorsement from NAFCED "an enormous boost" that he hopes will help the proposal gain traction.
We\'re going through a very critical stage here and we need a lot of different ideas, a lot of different thoughts, a lot of different perspectives so we can arrive at the best place for the game and the kids who play the game."
The biggest question will be whether the NCAA, or any other governing body, can enforce the rules on so many public and private institutions.
Lapchick said he thinks legislative action would be more compelling than any punishment that the NCAA could hand out.
When NAFCED held its first meeting in Atlanta last summer, Hewitt was initially reluctant to push for the rule because he was concerned it might be viewed as "self-serving."
He believes that basketball and football are held to a different standard than other sports such as baseball and hockey.

Well-known members of the group include Texas Tech University basketball coach Tubby Smith and Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson III.
Before the college football season began, his group released a study.
This includes all four teams that made it to the playoffs.
The question will be whether the NCAA could make so many public and private colleges follow the rule.
He was worried people might think he was supporting it only because he was looking for a new job himself.
It allows scientists to distinguish one strain from another, allowing earlier elimination of outbreaks around the world.
The zoom-in detail of a sequenced genome will make it possible to distinguish different strains of a microbe that are otherwise indistinguishable.
Using whole genome sequencing, researchers were able to find double the number of cases from a 2010 salmonella outbreak at a long-term health care facility in New York City.
They even found cases outside the region.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigated the plant and found 10 sanitation slip-ups, including four outright violations of safety rules.
In 2014, the FDA was able to halt a U.S. Listeria outbreak that had killed one and sickened seven others.
Davis microbiologist Bart Weimer, said, "We\'ve just extended the project to China, and they will map another 10,000 genomes and deposit them."
Sequencing a whole genome is only one of the new approaches to food safety.
The technology consists of DNA sequences extracted from plants; it is an odorless, colorless and tasteless material that can be mixed with waxes and oils already used and then sprayed on foods.
Then we can hold our phones over a fish fillet to make sure we know what we are eating.
Scientists are coming up with ways to use DNA to help protect people from diseases in food.
A recent study from Cornell University suggests the new technology will be faster and more effective.
"We\'ve just extended the project to China, and they will map another 10,000 genomes and deposit them," the project\'s director, Bart Weimer, said.
Finally, inspired by the bar-coding idea, one new company, DNATrek, is creating bar codes for food items.

The new methods promise to speed investigations and reduce foodborne illnesses and deaths.
They could also spot fake food.
Using whole genome sequencing, researchers were able to find double the number of cases in a 2010 outbreak of salmonella at a medical center in New York City.
In 2012, researchers picked out salmonella in tuna sushi that made 258 people sick.
"We\'ve just extended the project to China, and they will map another 10,000 genomes and deposit them," the project\'s director, Bart Weimer, said.
Food fraud prevention is also benefiting from a large project called the International Barcode of Life (iBOL).
The DNA sequences are like invisible bar codes and can be applied at different points where food is moved: the farm, the distributor, the packer and even the seller.
"When an outbreak occurs," company founder Anthony Zografos said, the tags can be read in about 20 minutes.
Scientists are coming up with ways to use DNA to help protect people from getting sick from their food.
The project is building a DNA library of all life on Earth.
The iBOL can already tell wild salmon from salmon raised on farms, because they are two different species.

Normally when it comes to squeezing tiny, individual living cells out into orderly patterns for lab experiments, scientists use inkjet printers.
Scientists say that it could significantly improve the survival rates of living cells and allow scientists to effectively print a variety of animal cells in various shapes on just about any surface.
They could also print cells just 5 micrometers apart \u2013 impressive, given that most animal cells are about 10 to 30 micrometers wide.
Woodblock printing was developed more than 1,800 years ago in China.
The mold is then pressed onto a surface and lifted away, leaving a pattern of cells in place.
They could also print cells just 5 micrometers apart \u2013 not bad, given that most animal cells are about 10 to 30 micrometers wide.
An inkjet cell printer can cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Woodblock printing was developed more than 1,800 years ago in China.
Scientists call their form of woodblock printing, "block-cell printing," or BloC-Printing for short.
They found that the new process could be done as quickly as in half an hour and with close to 100 percent of cells surviving undamaged.
They could also print cells just 5 micrometers apart \u2013 not bad, given that most animal cells are about 10 to 30 micrometers wide.
Scientists noticed that her cells were different and could be kept alive and grow.
Her cells have been used by scientists all around the world in experiments.
So scientists have turned to Chinese woodblock printing in order to find a solution.
The ancient printing system has proved to have benefits in the modern world.
Woodblock printing also gives scientists more choices.
And cells have just a 50 percent to 80 percent chance of staying alive using inkjet printing.
Little hooks were spaced along the sides of the stamps.
Vacuum pressure was used to suck it through to the other side of the mold.
The hooks were perfect for snagging single cells as they flew by.

Okwu, who is African-American, is among 26 students from a variety of backgrounds who took part in a program at the University of Washington this summer.
Students who go into conservation jobs often have a passion for nature and a mind for science, said Sean Watts, director of the Conservation Scholars summer program.
But they may lack people skills or the flexibility to consider an issue from different points of view.
The group also included students majoring in film studies, mechanical engineering, mathematics, business and economics.
"Climate change is going to be global, and it\'s important to take diverse viewpoints into account," said Jordan Morgan.
Northern Arizona University and the University of Florida also received Duke Foundation money to run programs this summer.
For example, the students visited an organic apple farm and met an older white farmer who employed migrant workers to pick his fruit.
"It was tense at times \u2014 you don\'t get to those conversations without a little tension," he said.
A new group of students will join the program next year.
The concern: More than 80 percent of people in conservation jobs \u2014 like the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and private groups such as the Nature Conservancy \u2014 are white, and come from wealthier backgrounds.
Students who go into conservation often have a passion for nature and a mind for science, said Sean Watts.
Some had parents who never graduated from high school.
They traveled from the slopes of Mount Rainier and Mount St. Helens to the dry grasslands of the Moses Coulee in Eastern Washington.
"Business has been one of the biggest polluters of the environment; I really want to change that," said Eric Katz, who is white.
The students noted that climate change is expected to have the worst effects on the poorest regions of the planet.
"Business has been one of the biggest polluters of the environment; I really want to change that," said Eric Katz.

Extremists from the Islamic State group have caused a global outcry by attacking ancient sites and monuments with jackhammers and bulldozers.
"They steal everything that they can sell, and what they can\'t sell, they destroy," said Qais Hussein Rasheed.
Anything genuine and small enough to move was likely sold off or stored by the group, they said.
The destruction of the poorly guarded national museum in Baghdad after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 was decried around the world.
He said some looted items have made their way to U.S. and other Western markets \u2014 especially antiquities in the lower- and medium-price ranges, such as stone seals with ancient writing.
The Archaeological Institute of America estimates that as much as 90 percent of classical artifacts in collections may be stolen antiquities.
Smaller items from Iraq and Syria are now widely sold online, said Deborah Lehr, the co-founder of the Antiquities Coalition.
In Baghdad, officials say they are doing what they can to stem the flow, but the Islamic State group is utilizing decades-old smuggling networks.
The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 brought more looting, with sites left completely unprotected.
It recently reopened to the public for the first time since 2003 in what officials described as an act of defiance against Islamic State destruction.
The Islamic State group has caused anger around the world by boldly destroying ancient monuments with jackhammers and bulldozers.

There may be a new reason to look forward to camping trips.
When the class of about 50 children arrived at the camp, they took two tests to measure their ability to read nonverbal social cues.
In the first, the kids were asked to judge the emotions in 48 photos of people making faces.
At the end of the five-day camp, the kids took the tests again.
According to researchers, the kids made an average of 14.02 errors on the face-recognition test at the beginning of their camp stay but only 9.41 errors by the end.
The researchers gave the same test to 54 sixth-graders from the same school who had not yet attended the camp.

A new study suggests that the ability to read nonverbal social cues can improve after just five days away from computers and iPhones.
Researchers are wondering whether children are losing the ability to read these important cues.
Uhls and professor Patricia Greenfield found a sixth-grade class that goes to a wilderness camp for five days.
When they arrived, they took two tests to measure their ability to read nonverbal social cues.
In the first, the kids were asked to judge the feelings in 48 photos of people making faces.

The new tags are like "a smartphone for marine animals," said Marco Flagg, CEO of Desert Star, a California company that offers the solar devices.
The Guy Harvey Research Institute, based in Dania Beach, Fla., is looking to use the solar tags to track certain species of the fierce fish.
The devices can gather an enormous amount of information, so much that batteries alone would die before all the data is transmitted, Shivji said.
Solar powered or not, tags already have provided researchers with detailed information about fish.
The overall success of solar tags has not yet been proven because of their relatively limited use.
The information is then transmitted to researchers.
"We\'ve discovered remarkable data on the behavior of these animals in terms of their movement," he said.
The sun might give hunted and overfished sharks a new ray of hope.
Some sharks have been hunted and fished too much.
The goal is to better understand the migratory patterns of the sharks.
The companies that make them say that a growing number of agencies plan to purchase solar tags.
Sharks are very important to the overall balance of ocean ecosystems.
But some fishermen catch and kill sharks by the millions for their fins, cartilage and meat.
That data includes how deep the fish go and the water temperatures they come across.

One recent former player tweeted commitments to four different schools without informing any coaches.
Social media have become more widespread, and that helps coaches fill the information gap in recruiting.
"When you\'re growing up, you probably want to get a big-time job somewhere and they look back at your Twitter account and they see the things you\'re putting out," Lammons said.
Hand said his wife scolded him for the tone of the tweet.
This is about as obvious as it gets about what kind of thing we\'re dealing with here, so we backed out altogether," Bielema said.

De Blasio, who hails from Brooklyn, reached out to New Yorkers he contended were left behind by the often Manhattan-centric Bloomberg administration.
He charged that a de Blasio victory would return the city to its crime-filled past, a point he made with a TV ad that showed images of violence from decades ago.
De Blasio, a white man married to a black woman, also received a boost from a campaign ad featuring their son.
But his campaign struggled early, and he was slow to raise money.
New York City elected its first Democratic mayor in two decades on Tuesday.
He railed against economic inequality and portrayed New York as a "tale of two cities" \u2014 one rich, the other working class \u2014 under the pro-business mayor.
His campaign got a boost when a federal judge ruled that police had unfairly singled out blacks and Hispanics under the policy.
The new mayor worked for both Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Gov.
De Blasio also pledged to improve job opportunities in minority and poor neighborhoods.
But those same surveys showed that the city was hungry for a change.

A new rule at California State University says no, and is sparking a national debate.
InterVarsity Christian Fellowship is a national Christian group for college students.
As a result, it has found itself in a standoff with Cal State and other universities.
Under the new "all-comers" rule, a student can join any group regardless of his or her background.
They also cannot be a part of student fairs or receive money from student associations.
InterVarsity members consider the new rules to be unfair.
For some in InterVarsity, not signing the all-comers rule was a matter of principle.
"I don\'t think a non-Christian would want to be a leader in a Christian group," said Cal State student Jasmine Kim.
The rule does not just apply to religion, however.
It also says that no student can be shut out based on his or her background.
It means that a white student could lead the Chinese Student Association.
Since then, universities have become tougher on groups that are not open to all.
Some legal scholars say that what is happening to religious groups at colleges is happening across the country.
He claims that this is part of the constitutional right of individuals to meet and form groups.
Other experts, however, say the Cal State all-comer rule is legal as long as it applied to everyone.

She said she had to adjust to how boldly American girls behaved when her family moved to the United States two years ago.
"You need to be confident and you need to expect the best of yourself."
The 18-year-old said she felt frustrated when her family moved from Zacapa, Guatemala, to Glendale Heights, Illinois, in April 2013.

The Secret Service is in charge of protecting the president, his family and visiting foreign leaders.
"Over the last several days, we\'ve seen recent and accumulating reports raising questions about the performance of the agency," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.
The gun was discovered only after agents noticed the guard was acting oddly.
According to court papers, Gonzalez climbed over the north fence of the White House at 7:19 p.m.
He then allegedly knocked over an agent inside the door and wrestled with guards who chased him into the East Room.
She could give no good reason why agents failed to stop Gonzalez before he entered the White House.
She also had trouble explaining why the agency did not admit for more than a week that Gonzalez had forced his way deep inside before he was tackled.
In fact, he carried a black folding knife in his pocket, the agency later admitted.
Investigators also found hundreds of rounds of ammunition for shotguns, pistols and rifles in his car.

Almost four years after the MV-22 Osprey arrived in Afghanistan with a reputation as dangerous and hard to maintain, the U.S. Marine Corps finally has had an opportunity to test the hybrid aircraft in a war zone.
It is still probably more expensive than it should be, and more expensive to operate.
The odd aircraft, which takes off and lands like a helicopter but rotates its engines forward to fly like an airplane, had a star-crossed development period.
"The Osprey has proven itself in Afghanistan in a way it did not in Iraq," he said.
Among the recent missions the squadron has flown was one in which the Osprey showed its strengths: a Marine with a head wound at a distant base needed to be moved for quick treatment.
A conventional helicopter would have been hard-pressed to do the same, even without the 40-mile run, Sanders said.
Ulsh noted that last month the first of 12 Ospreys joined the fleet of aircraft used for presidential travel.
That, McCain said, more than doubled the cost per hour of flight, compared with about $4,600 for the CH-46.
Almost four years after the MV-22 Osprey arrived in Afghanistan with a reputation as dangerous and hard to repair, the U.S. Marine Corps finally has had an opportunity to test the hybrid aircraft in real warfare.
"This is an ugly duckling that turned into a swan," said Richard Whittle, the author of  _"The Dream Machine: The Untold History of the Notorious V-22 Osprey.
"Partly that was because it didn\'t get the chance in Iraq."
A Marine with a head wound at a distant base needed to be moved for quick treatment.
They picked up the wounded man and flew another 75 miles or so to the massive coalition base in Kandahar.

It can carry more cargo and more than twice as many troops.
A Marine with a head wound at a distant base needed to be moved for quick treatment.
The crew dashed for the Osprey and zoomed some 40 miles.
The rate for Class A flight mishaps - those that involve death or permanent disability and/or more than $2 million in damage - is 1.48 per 100,000 hours of flying time since the aircraft was declared operational in 2007, according to Marine Corps spokesman Capt.
But Whittle said it compared well, pointing out that in the last decade, the military has lost about 420 helicopters and more than 600 people in them, while the Osprey has had three fatal crashes since 2001, killing six.
They cost $122.5 million each, according to Sen. John McCain, a longtime critic of the Osprey.
It also is not cheap to maintain, particularly in harsh operating environments such as the extremely dusty south of Afghanistan.

In California, however, such plans have run into heavy opposition.
Despite those defeats, proponents say the time has finally arrived for Californians to accept direct potable reuse as a partial solution to their growing water shortage.
Recently, a leader in the effort to stop the Los Angeles project more than a decade ago said he might consider a new plan if officials made a solid case for it.
They note that more than 200 wastewater treatment plants already discharge sewage into the Colorado River, which is a primary source of drinking water for Southern California.
"That\'s what I call de facto potable reuse," said George Tchobanoglous, a water treatment expert and professor at the University of California, Davis.
The result is a purified substance that is cleaner than most bottled waters, according to WateReuse California, a group that advocates for water reuse.
There it is blended with other sources of water, processed and pumped to household taps.
The presence of so-called "contaminants of emerging concern" may prove to be one of the main barriers to direct potable reuse.
"This just goes to show how the yuck factor can stick with some people," said Chan.
"That water is discharged into the ocean and lost forever," said Tim Quinn, director of the Association of California Water Agencies.
"You know, toilet to tap might be the only answer at this point," said activist Donald Schultz.
First, the water is passed through a microfilter that blocks anything larger than 1/300th the thickness of a human hair.
However, Oppenheimer said he would use such water for household cleaning and even bathing.

However, Oppenheimer said he would use such water for cleaning and even bathing.
"This just goes to show how the yuck factor can stick with some people," Chan said.
With California Governor Jerry Brown ordering a 25-percent cut in water use in some areas, the solution makes sense, they say.
Next, it undergoes even finer filtering through a process called reverse osmosis: water is forced through a membrane that blocks fertilizers, drug compounds, viruses and salts.
In the third step, ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide are used to break down any disease-causing bacteria that escaped the first two steps.
There it is blended with other sources of water, processed and pumped to homes.
Coastal cities pour billions of gallons of sewage into the Pacific Ocean each year.
"This just goes to show how the yuck factor can stick with some people," Chan said.
California is in the middle of a terrible drought.
They say the time has finally come for Californians to accept direct potable reuse.
It particularly makes sense for large coastal cities such as Los Angeles.
"You know, toilet to tap might be the only answer at this point," said Schultz.
However, Oppenheimer said he would use such water for cleaning and even bathing.
She says many people become more supportive of such programs as they learn more about them.
However, the opposite is true for others \u2014 they become even more strongly against the idea.

"They said you could build your own game and I said, great!
Maybe I can do (game design) in the future," Taplet, 17, said recently after creating a simple "Star Wars"-themed program during a schoolwide coding event.
And qualified workers are so scarce that half a million jobs remain unfilled, according to the federal government.
These obstacles range from finding enough qualified teachers to convincing administrators to invest money in a subject that is not covered by standardized tests.
To get a more diverse group, a nonprofit called Code.org is trying to get the subject into every American school, starting in kindergarten.
"The enjoyable part is just creating something that I want to create," said A.J.
There are a lot of jobs out there dealing with coding and computer science itself, but people don\'t know about" them.

California, worried about the incentives other states are using to lure Hollywood productions, last year tripled the money available for film tax breaks.
And Maine, which has limited film incentives, now is considering a 25 percent credit for wages paid to residents employed by film productions.
For example, Netflix\'s "House of Cards" last year threatened to pull production out of Maryland until the state extended its generous tax credit program.

"It\'s fun whacking away," quipped Duke University student Chelsea Bright, who plans to become an archaeologist.
Haggis and his partner in the project, Margaret Mook, were convinced from pottery they found that the site was much older than initially thought.
Because no one has been able to decipher the language of the Cretans of this period, much of their history is a blank slate: It can only be interpreted from what is dug up from the ground.
The dig also uncovered what is called the Monumental Civic Building, a large hall with a stepped bench built into the walls and an adjoining two-room shrine.

Many teens are sent to state prisons when they turn 18 and are adults.
When children and teenagers break the law, they sometimes have to spend time behind bars.
Budnick, and volunteers like him, try to help.
It might be hard to imagine why these kids would want to be in a writing class.
One reason they take the class is that they miss out on  regular school.
Another reason is that being in juvenile hall can bring up strong feelings.
Writing lets them express feelings like anger and guilt in a healthy way.
For example, Budnick had one class read a newspaper article about a man named Steven Czifra.
Now, Czifra is a college student at the University of California in Berkeley.

For Kroll, who had poured her life savings into the bakery, that was a critical question.
The story of how she offered paid positions to McDonough and two other men with autism is one of luck and goodwill.
But it is also, according to Kroll, the story of a clear-eyed business decision.
Kroll invited five men with autism to help her construct and label boxes for her chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin and shortbread cookies.
There was Michael, who was playful and cracked jokes, and Jimmy, who was so focused that he could label boxes as fast as any worker.

Long considered an elite track for the most talented and ambitious students, AP classes are now seen as beneficial for any students willing to push themselves.
The College Board, which runs the AP program and is encouraging open access, said the effort has generally been successful.
Low-income students are twice as likely as others to attend schools without a full array of AP courses, according to one study.
Jocz enlivened an otherwise dry lesson on Henry Clay\'s "American System" national economic plan with music clips from Bruce Springsteen and Queen and amusing factoids about the Erie Canal during a recent class.
She is failing her AP U.S. history class; she said she is overwhelmed by the rapid pace and volume of material she needs to memorize.
But she said she intends to stick it out because the class is teaching her to manage her time, take good notes and keep trying.
"While expanding access is generally a good thing, we need to make sure we\'re not watering down the experience for the high achievers," said Michael Petrilli.
He pointed out content likely to appear on the AP exam and directed students to work in groups on an AP-type essay question about the contributions of Thomas Jefferson.
At Jordan High School in Watts, Evan Dvorak  allowed any student to take his AP physics class last year.
Long Beach, Calif. schools opened its AP classes a decade ago; the district has boosted the percentage of students taking the spring exams to 21 percent of its sophomores, juniors and seniors this year.
At Keppel, some parents whose children were shut out of AP classes say they support the goal of open access.
Her son, Douglas, failed to get into an AP biology class after doing the summer work during a family vacation.
Schools used to think Advanced Placement (AP) classes were special courses for top students.

Advanced Placement (AP) classes are tough courses.
The school switched to a computer-based lottery to distribute spaces in Advanced Placement (AP) courses.
Alex initially got shut out of all three courses he requested.
Schools increasingly see access to them as a basic educational right.

But the failure rate is up only a bit, officials said.
Jocz sees both good and bad in letting all students take AP classes.
But they do not like choosing students for the classes by chance.
Cheland started attending parkour classes at Enso Movement in Raleigh when the gym opened in April.
He goes to classes about twice a week, but "he\'d go every day if he could," his dad says.
"Let\'s work on nice and quiet jumps," he advised, reminding his pupils that landing flat-footed is loud and potentially painful.
Enso Movement offers some instruction during the day, but most classes are in the evening, each with five to 13 students.
The differences: Parkour \u2014 As Faircloth notes, parkour is about moving efficiently from Point A to Point B in a safe and speedy manner.
Freerunning \u2014 Described by Enso Movement as an "expressive" performance "with roots in parkour and branches in gymnastics, martial arts, dance and more."
According to Faircloth, it is more about "complex acrobatic moves, kicking, spins, turns," break-dancing and similar moves.
"Parkour is essentially training yourself to move more efficiently from Point A to Point B effectively, safely and with speed," he said.

For eight years, Weyant has tapped, banged and stroked the fence to produce haunting sounds in a region he has called practically a "militarized zone."
At one point, Weyant played a cello while wearing a zebra-head mask.
He once tried out a moose call, blowing into the whistlelike contraption while standing next to the fence.
His method, like his music, was on the fly and low-tech: He inserted electronic equipment into a tin can, turning it into a microphone.
For eight years, Weyant has tapped, banged and stroked the fence to produce haunting sounds in a region he has called a "militarized zone."
His songs can last a minute \u2014 or more than half an hour.
One day in 2005 he decided that he wanted to hear what sounds the fence could make.
Weyant, a former professor of journalism and now a stay-at-home dad, said he gets to the border often once a month.
He has given lectures about his music at universities.
Another radioed his boss: "There\'s a guy playing the wall.
"Usually," Weyant said, "when you play in a venue, you don\'t have people with guns watching you."
For the most part, border police have left him alone.

It was pulled from the cold, damp depths of a Spanish cave called Sima de los Huesos, or "Pit of Bones."
Paabo and his partners published a report on their findings this past week in the magazine Nature.
Or maybe the group "actually interbred with something much older, something like Homo erectus, and obtained its mitochondrial DNA from them," Paabo said.
At some point about 30,000 years ago, all other species of the Homo genus were wiped out.
Answers to this mystery may emerge if the team is able to recover nuclear DNA from cells in the bone.
Cool, moist conditions within the cave, as well as rapid advancements in DNA technology, made it easier.
Bone remains of European Neanderthals have allowed scientists to describe their appearance in detail.
We know quite well what Neanderthals look like.
We have their DNA, and "we have two teeth, and those teeth are huge.
"This is positively exciting," said Andrea Manica, a scientist at the University of Cambridge in England.
The DNA they decoded is the oldest material ever recovered from an early human.
It beats the last record by roughly 300,000 years.
We have their DNA, "and we have two teeth, and those teeth are huge.
The DNA is the oldest known material ever found from an early human.
They have far less information than DNA from a cell nucleus.
The nucleus is the control center of the cell.
Answers to this mystery may come out if the team is able to get nuclear DNA from cells in the bone.
Ancient DNA has been very difficult to figure out.
Older DNA samples have been gotten from other animals.
Cool, wet conditions within the cave, as well as new technology, made it easier.
Alongside the leg were the remains of 28 other individuals.
We know quite well what Neanderthals looked like.
We have their DNA, "and we have two teeth, and those teeth are huge.
Humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans all came from Homo erectus orginally.
"This is positively exciting," said Andrea Manica, a scientist in England.
About 30,000 years ago, the other groups died off.
The DNA is the oldest known material ever found from an early human.
What they got was taken from cell mitochondria.
The bone might be from a group that was related to both Neanderthals and Denisovans.
Neanderthals might have gotten different DNA after the two groups split off.
And maybe it got its DNA from them.
It means that much older remains can be explored by looking at DNA.
When some of his pigs started dying early this year, following a series of temperature swings and rains, there was little choice but to throw them out, said the farmer.
If we do, we will be punished," said Wang, 43.
The fleet of putrid flesh was bobbing along in a major source of drinking water for Shanghai, home to more than 20 million people.
For this reason, locals say the decision to sell dead pigs to shady brokers was not difficult, despite the fact that it could mean dangerous meat making its way to the dinner table.
But that effort formed yet another problem \u2014 farmers without many resources were left with a lot of dead pigs.
Like the men standing around him in Donghui, all pig farmers, Wang had no answer for what illness in particular had killed his animals this year.
One farmer complained in an interview, "When there\'s disease we don\'t understand what\'s going on, and they (officials) don\'t tell us which vaccines to use."
The man, who did not want his name published, had pulled up on a black scooter in front of a small livestock dumping station next to a trash shed.
Yu also said that "water in the Huangpu River, where a great number of dead pigs were found, meets national standards for drinking water," according to an account by the state news agency Xinhua.
But it was not clear how Pan, in prison before the floating pigs came to light, could answer with such certainty.
But the pigs-in-the-river scandal is a reminder of the distance that lies between those dreams and the grimmer aspects of life in China.
In Donghui, southwest of Shanghai in neighboring Zhejiang province, farmers spoke of their need for money and information.
Officials have since promised to expand both pickup and disposal services.
Like the other pig farmers standing around him in Donghui, Wang had no answer for what had killed his animals this year.
"Those people sit in offices and they hear about the pigs in the river from lower levels ... so how can they learn what\'s really happening?"
The man had pulled up on a black scooter in front of a small livestock dumping station next to a trash shed.
He also said that "water in the Huangpu River, where a great number of dead pigs were found, meets national standards for drinking water," according to an article in the state Xinhua newswire.
But late last year, the government began cracking down.
One farmer there complained, "When there\'s disease we don\'t understand what\'s going on, and they (officials) don\'t tell us which vaccines to use."
He said he has been losing money as the price of pork falls and the costs of feed and other supplies climb.

"My goal was to teach," Anand said.
Anand Mariappan is from Seattle, Washington.
Anand and his team had to make changes.
And they are working with local medical device companies to develop new generations of software to train the next generation of medical students.
Until simulators came along about 15 years ago, the only way for surgeons to get hands-on experience was to cut into living patients.
Sweet, 44, said the idea for simulator training came to him as he was learning prostate surgery, during his third year of residency at the University of Washington.
"They have more self-confidence and maybe more importantly, they learn their own limitations," said David Hananel, who helps run the medical school\'s simulation programs.
An added benefit: Simulators collect information that can be used to research methods of surgery and detect common errors.
Until simulators came along about 15 years ago, the only way for doctors to get hands-on experience was to cut into living patients.
And we rapidly run them through tests."
"You need to understand the object you\'re simulating," he said.
"We actually are trying to teach them the errors, the mistakes, the things that shouldn\'t be done."
Sweet said most first-timers last less than a minute before he has to take over.
And they are working with local medical device companies to develop new software to train the next generation of medical students.
They will allow medical residents to get hands-on experience and learn from their mistakes without harming patients, said Dr. Robert M. Sweet.
Until simulators came along about 15 years ago, the only way for doctors to get hands-on experience was to cut into living patients.
Dr. Travis Pagliara, a third-year resident, said the machines are incredibly lifelike.
They get to practice with a device that uses sound waves to liquefy brain tumors and then sucks away the remains.
It may be the biggest change in medical training since the early 1900s.
Sweet, 44, said the idea for simulator training came to him as he was learning surgery.
Medical residents are doctors who have finished medical school and are training in hospitals to get more experience.
How he moves his body affects what happens on the screen.
But, he added that the simulator made an important difference.
The cave is one of a group of caves known as Rising Star.
He asked the men to keep their eyes open for old bones.
What they found amazed them.
On Thursday Berger was finally ready to announce what had been found.
The word was picked because of the name of the caves.
"Homo" is the Latin word for "man."
Berger and his team plan to return to the chamber.
"This chamber has not given up all its secrets," he said.
Canada will never be intimidated," Prime Minister Stephen Harper pledged in an address to the nation.
The assault rocked Parliament over and over with the boom of gunfire, led members of Parliament to barricade doors with chairs and sent people running from the building in fear.
A government official said that Zehaf-Bibeau was a recent convert to Islam.
The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa was locked down for safety, and security was tightened at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington.

Zobl was looking down from his fourth-floor window directly above the memorial.
Nothing frustrates Brad Kramer more than watching students dump their required servings of fruits and vegetables in the trash.
They say the rules, imposed in 2012, are too costly and restrictive, and that Congress should loosen them.
Students also ate 20 percent more vegetables and 13 percent more of their lunch entrees.
"(Going) back to less-healthy meals now would not be in the best interest of our children," Vilsack said.
"We need solutions."
"We have some of the healthiest trash cans in the nation," Brad Kramer said.
The study found that 66 percent of students added fruit to their lunch trays last year.

Tidal officials did not disclose financial details about how artists that are played on Tidal would be paid.
Tidal describes itself as "the first music streaming service that combines the best high-fidelity sound quality, high-definition music videos and expertly curated editorial."
The pricing will include two levels of fees and access \u2014 with no free service.
Although the streaming service will offer original content, there are already plenty of free social media services and other ways for artists to engage with fans.
We want to create a better service and a better experience for both fans and artists," singer Alicia Keys, one of the owners of Tidal, said during the presentation.
Tidal, which is available in 31 countries, had 500,000 paid subscribers at the end of 2014.
It has plans to expand to six more countries.

Shortly after she launched her anti-obesity campaign more than three years ago, Michelle Obama signaled she would take on advertising for snacks, soft drinks, sugary cereals and fast food aimed at children.
"The White House got cold feet," said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
But many public health advocates believe a more forceful approach is needed to limit food ads.
"This is one of the easiest areas where we could take action and have a very powerful effect," said Dale Kunkel, who studies the effect of advertising on children.
In 2009, Congress approved a measure to set up a group to write voluntary nutrition standards for products advertised to children.
Powell suggested the group should "be put on hold" while food companies improved the Children\'s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, which was set up in 2006.
Two days later, top food makers rolled out a more rigorous version of their own effort.
The companies pledged to limit the levels of sugar, salt and fat in products targeted at children.
The group gave itself until the end of this year to make the changes.
The industry program does not limit sponsorships of after-school events or on product packages, as the guidelines had proposed.
More than three years ago Michelle Obama launched an anti-obesity campaign.
And the first lady rallied support for a 2010 law that expanded the [free school lunch program](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch).
As she stepped up her campaign, the first lady rged companies to limit advertising to kids.

Congress approved a measure in 2009 to set up a group to write voluntary nutrition standards for products advertised to children.
Powell suggested the group should "be put on hold" while food companies improved the Children\'s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative.
The group said its standards should apply to all ads aimed at children 17 and younger.
Snacks, soft drinks, sugary cereals and fast food have been blamed for making many American children overweight, or even obese.
Obama told food companies "to step it up" to improve the foods they advertise for children.
The group said its standards should be used for all ads aimed at children 17 and younger.
Michelle Obama looked like she was ready to fight the food companies three years ago.
More than three years ago Michelle Obama launched an anti-obesity campaign.
But when food and television fought those guidelines in 2011, the first lady went silent.
And she has avoided fights that could pit her against the companies.
Administration officials say she has had some notable successes.
A report by the Institute of Medicine found in 2005 that television advertising influenced children to look for unhealthy foods.
"This is one of the easiest areas where we could take action and have a very powerful effect," said Dale Kunkel.
Congress approved a measure in 2009 to set up a group to write voluntary nutrition standards for products advertised to children.
Powell suggested the group should "be put on hold" while food companies improved the Children\'s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative.
Still, the group released its guidelines in April 2011.
Public health supporters such as the American Academy of Pediatrics praised the guidelines.
Two days later, top food makers rolled out a tougher version of their own effort.
Half the food and drink ads seen by children in 2011 were not covered by the pledge because they aired on shows, such as "Family Guy," that are seen by both children and adults, a Yale study said.
Snacks, soft drinks, sugary cereals and fast food have been blamed for making many American children overweight, or even obese.

"Children giving to children is really valuable," Oppenheimer said, praising Kyle\'s ability to appeal to fellow teenagers, and to motivate students in lower grades to be part of the project.
The idea behind her one-person organization is simple: People learn about her mission from her website, then mail in or hand-deliver pencils to her.
She packs them, fitting around 200 pencils in sealed bags, then hands the packages to travelers heading for developing countries, who carry them in their suitcases.
She said she came up with the idea when volunteering with a medical mission to Peru in 2005.
She had taken a suitcase of clothing to donate, but soon realized that people wanted her pen.
Kyle reached out last summer and "was super interested and energetic," Oppenheimer said.
Since he started his drives, the donations have been pouring in from local businesses, churches and schools.
Throughout February, students dropped pencils and markers into shoe boxes outside classrooms and the cafeteria.
Kyle took them home and said he planned to pack them in the sealed bags and bring them to Oppenheimer so she could coordinate their delivery.
Christopher Bacchioni, a fifth-grader, said he donated "to help people in need."
In this remote and rugged country, a band of gunmen and self-proclaimed defenders of the U.S. Constitution are making their latest and boldest stand.
But the long-running debate over federal control of public land has come to a new standoff in the rolling ranch lands of southeastern Oregon.

TAWA, Canada \u2013 One-quarter of all the food in the world is lost each year due to inefficient harvesting, inadequate storage and waste in the kitchen.
The extent of food loss is particularly shocking in view of a new global study on food security from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO).
Over the last 25 years, the world has fed an extra 2 billion people and \u2013 despite the 57 countries that failed \u2013 the developing world as a whole has almost halved its hunger rate.
These targets are vitally important, because they will determine how more than $2.5 trillion in development money will be spent.
Therefore, we asked 60 teams of top researchers to assess which proposed targets will do the most good \u2013 and which will not.
Our research on food security shows that there are smart ways to feed many more on the planet \u2013 but they have little to do with the attempts to stop waste in rich countries.
These are luxuries when compared with the cheap calories contained in the grains and tubers consumed throughout the developing world.
By 2050, better infrastructure could mean that 57 million people \u2013 more than the current population of South Africa \u2013 would no longer be at risk of hunger.
TAWA, Canada \u2013 One-quarter of all the food in the world is lost each year.
There are many solutions for this kind of waste, from the practice of "curing" roots to minimize damage, to refrigeration.
We can achieve three times the financial benefits if we focus on improving food production rather than just on preventing food losses.
Investing an extra $88 billion in agricultural research and development over the next 15 years would increase food yields an additional 0.4 percent each year.
This calls for investing in improved infrastructure and in agricultural research and development.

TAWA, Canada \u2013 Today, 1 in every 9 people on the planet are hungry.
TAWA, Canada \u2013 One-quarter of all the food in the world is lost each year.
One reason is that by then the world will have added another 2 billion mouths to feed; a second reason will be the growing appetite of a surging new middle class, as economies grow and people have more money to spend.
At the moment, the United Nations is considering 169 new development targets to succeed the Millennium Development Goals.
The problems range from climate change to malaria.
By 2050, better infrastructure could mean that 57 million people would no longer be at risk of hunger.

Search and rescue teams looking for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight have found no signs of the plane.
For the first time since the search focused on the southern Indian Ocean 10 days ago, the sky was clear and the sea was calm.
This allowed the ships working off the west coast of Australia to recover the "suspicious items" spotted by planes and on satellite pictures.
They were just the ordinary garbage swirling around the ocean.
The disappointing results shows the difficulty in trying to find out what happened to the Boeing 777 aircraft.
Australian authorities said Sunday that a naval support ship will leave on Monday with a "black box detector" supplied by the U.S. Navy.
The odds are stacked against finding it in time without a trail of trash to guide them.
But the area gathers a surprisingly large amount of garbage, trapped in the slowly rotating currents.
The lack of  wreckage has prevented families from achieving closure over the deaths of their relatives.

Tracy Peasant began crying on the witness stand in federal court Monday morning.
The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) never told her she could request a hearing to challenge the bill, Peasant testified.
Peasant said her water was unexpectedly restored in June by a woman she believed to be a DWSD worker.
He asked McCormick if it was legal to cut off service without complying with rules on the website.
The nonprofit groups include the National Action Network, Michigan Welfare Rights Organization, Moratorium Now and the Peoples Water Board.
"The city has a responsibility to all of its residents," Mithani said.
This is wrong,\'" Peasant said.
The nonprofit groups called Sue McCormick to testify about the shut-off policy.
McCormick said the department stopped letting customers know about their water bill debts face-to-face, but she was unsure exactly when the policy changed.
Tracy Peasant began crying in court Monday as she described how her water service had been shut off by the city.
"It was hard," Peasant said, wiping her eyes with a tissue.
The nonprofit groups include the National Action Network, Michigan Welfare Rights Organization and the Peoples Water Board.
Peasant said her water was unexpectedly turned back on in June by a woman she believed to be a city worker.
She described buying bottled water for herself and eight children after her water service was cut off.
The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) never told her she could request a hearing to challenge the bill, Peasant said.
The old rules, written in 2003, call for a Water Department worker to identify himself or herself to the customer and show how much money is owed.
The judge focused on this difference between what the rule says and what actually happened.
She could not say how many of the homes had children living in them or people with medical problems or disabilities.

However, lawyers for the city said Detroit cannot give away water for free.
Lawyer Sonal Mithani said stopping the shut-offs would only hurt customers who have not paid their water bills.
She could not say how many of those homes had children or people with health problems living in them.
Her salary comes to about 63 times more than what Peasant makes.

Everett Middle School Principal Lena Van Haren announced the winners more than a week after the results were known.
She said that she had no intention of saying the votes did not count, but she wanted to first engage all the candidates in a discussion about how to ensure underrepresented groups were heard.
The school of about 500 sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders is 56 percent Hispanic or Latino and 9 percent African-American, according to the California Department of Education.
"This is complex, but as a parent and a principal, I truly believe it behooves us to be thoughtful about our next steps here," Van Haren wrote.
She said Van Haren may have been wrong to delay announcing the election results, but her goal of making it a lesson about ensuring all people are represented was right.
David said the principal hurt the democratic process in the name of social justice.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ordered the National Guard to Ferguson early Monday, hours after police use tear gas to disperse protesters.
An autopsy requested by his family found the teen was shot at least six times, including twice in the head.
As night fell in Ferguson, another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated after marchers pushed toward one end of a street and authorities pushed them back by repeatedly firing tear gas.
A federally conducted autopsy "more closely focused on entry point of (bullets), defensive wounds and bruises" might help the Justice Department\'s investigation, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor.
Federal authorities also want to calm any public fears that nothing will be done in the case, Weinstein said.
Officers in riot gear ordered all protesters to leave.
Many of the marchers retreated, but a group of about 100 stood defiantly about two blocks away until they got hit by tear gas.
Protesters laid a line of concrete blocks across the street near a convenience store that was burned down last week.
The crackle of gunfire could be heard from several blocks away.
Johnson added, "We all need to thank the Browns for Michael.
Police have said little about what happened between Brown and the officer, except to say that it involved a scuffle in which the officer was injured and Brown was shot.
Witnesses say the teenager had his hands in the air as the officer fired multiple bullets at him.
Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, is a six-year police veteran with no previous complaints against him.
The department has refused to say anything about his whereabouts.
Some members of the group, composed mostly of police and relatives of officers, carried signs urging people to wait for all the facts in the case before they make up their minds.

It ranges from George Orwell\'s "Animal Farm" and William Golding\'s "Lord of the Flies" to Kazuo Ishiguro\'s novel "Never Let Me Go," Alan Bennett\'s play "The History Boys," and "Anita and Me," a coming-of-age novel by comedian and author Meera Syal.
The 19th-century novels on offer include Charles Dickens\' "Great Expectations," Jane Austen\'s "Pride and Prejudice" and Mary Shelley\'s "Frankenstein."
But debate on the changes has focused on the loss of "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Of Mice and Men," which several generations of Britons remember,  mostly fondly, from their school days.

So far in Afghanistan, the problem of mistaking a toy gun for a real one has not been as bad as it could be.
For one thing, the noise of real gunfire is almost unmistakable to most Afghans.
The toy guns come mostly from China and neighboring Pakistan.
Many were given to young boys as gifts during the recent Eid festival, which marks the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
A video was prepared "to inform people how much these toy guns can be dangerous," said Dr. Abdul Rahim Majeed of the Noor Eye Hospital.
They "didn\'t pay attention to this important message and it caused many people to get injured and come to hospitals for treatments."
Parents like Shakib Nasery, a 38-year-old father of two, welcome the effort to destroy the toy guns.
Weapons can be seen almost everywhere in Afghanistan these days.
Nearly all those hurt were children.
Before the holiday started, the government tried to warn parents about the dangers of toy guns.

The White House said that Rousseff and Obama agreed it would be better to have the visit later.
Obama "understands and regrets" the concern in Brazil, the White House said.
There have been three news reports in Brazil based on top secret papers since July.
The NSA also spied on other senior officials, the report said.
They did not want one issue between the countries to get all the attention, "no matter how important or challenging the issue may be," the White House said.
He had planned to meet in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month.
But then Putin let Snowden stay in Russia temporarily.

In an isolated forest in southern Florida, a throng of reporters and photographers watched as a panther was lowered to the ground in a crate.
This is a common fate for male panthers rescued and released by state wildlife officers.
Three were killed by other panthers, one by a vehicle, two by disease and two by unknown causes.
"Every panther life is important at this point because you\'re dealing with one of the most critically [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) in the United States," said Jennifer Hecker, director of a Florida conservation group.
But many people who live or hunt around the panther habitat oppose any program that adds more of the cats to land already full of them.
Last week, the wildlife agency captured and relocated a young male found near a local beach.
It\'s cruel to the cats, and it\'s dangerous to people," she said.
The work going into rescuing panthers can be complex.
Orphaned panthers are taken to the White Oak Conservation Center where they grow up with minimal human contact and learn to hunt on their own.
Although some veterinary services are donated, the state pays most of the bills, relying on sales of "Protect the Panther" license plates.
When discovered near death, he was found with scars on his face, evidence that he survived fights with other panthers.
"The fact that he had been in a fight and survived indicates that he was \'man enough\' to stand up to other panthers and walk away wiser," Lotz said.

With limited space, the panthers face more dangers.
That is why Florida wildlife workers are trying so hard to rescue orphaned animals, raise them, and release them back into the wild.

These population declines have effects far beyond maintaining a supply of fish that consumers like to eat.
Predators keep prey populations in balance, and the loss of predators can cause ripple effects that affect entire ocean ecosystems.
Only by taking these steps can we ensure that we will have healthy populations of these fish \u2014 and healthy oceans \u2014 in the future.
Many predatory fish species are known to be in trouble.
Top predators are large animals, like lions or great white sharks, that hunt smaller animals, but have no natural enemies.

Top predators are large animals, such as lions or great white sharks, that hunt smaller animals, but have no natural enemies of their own \u2014 except humans.
This keeps all the ocean life in balance.
For example, kelp-eating sea urchins have been growing in number due to the loss of predators that eat urchins.
Thirty-four fish stocks \u2014 local populations of fish of the same species \u2014 have been declared rebuilt since the year 2000.

Scientists studied food webs involving more than 3,000 ocean species.
Since the beginning of the 20th century, humans have reduced predatory fish populations by more than two-thirds.
Most of this decline has occurred since the 1970s.
The result has been the destruction of kelp forests, which are home to many important species.

It\'s a story from before Werner Klemke was deeply beloved for his drawings of the "Grimm\'s Fairy Tales," which made their way to every East German child\'s bookshelf.
It surfaced only when Dutch documentary filmmaker Annet Betsalel asked whether she could poke around in the long-shuttered records of the Jewish community of Bussum, the Netherlands.
He knew in 1942 that Jews were living on borrowed time under Nazi occupation and that if they were going to survive they were going to need help.
It began once upon a time, in a city called Amsterdam, in a magical bookstore called Erasmus, famed for carrying books filled with ideas the Nazis feared.
They allowed van Perlstein to get back his business and money that had been frozen.
That money went to pay for the resistance to the Nazis, and a hideaway network.
Klemke, who later in life was known for perfectionism in printing down to the choices of paper, typefaces and inks for the books in which his work was published, made up a story to hide his work from his Nazi superiors.
He told them that he could make nice booklets of cocktail recipes for them if he could only get a small printing office set up.
Once this was provided, he made the cocktail books \u2014 but he also produced fake birth certificates, food ration coupons, baptismal records and ID cards.
As Betsalel mentioned, the notion of Jews hidden in the Netherlands is hardly news.
The hiding places built into walls and attics and cellars in the village were not discovered, and today are used as storage rooms.
Yet Klemke, whose artwork made him a perfect storyteller, never talked about that stage of his life, not in dozens of interviews or speeches.
It had long been known that Klemke had been a German soldier during World War II, stationed in the Netherlands to uphold the Nazi occupation of that nation.
On his deathbed, Klemke told his children they could find "important documents" in his office.
"Many a German kept silent about their S.S. membership," it wrote, referring to the worst of the Nazi troops.

It began once upon a time, in a city called Amsterdam, in a magical bookstore called Erasmus.
He did this work while knowing that had his bosses, or any unfriendly person, discovered what he was up to, he almost certainly would have been executed.
Over the next few years, he produced documents that helped some people escape from the country, and allowed others to survive while they remained in hiding.
In all, the rescue network saved about 500 Jews.
Others, including members of the resistance and British pilots, also were saved.
Whatever the motivation, the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung recently noted the strange twist to his story.
"Many a German kept silent about their S.S. membership," it wrote, referring to the evil Nazi troops.
One day, a young German soldier named Johannes Gerhardt came to the store.
He was so thrilled by the books that when he left the store, he forgot his rifle.
A young man named Mels de Jong chased him down.
He did this work even knowing that had his bosses, or any unfriendly person, discovered what he was doing, he almost certainly would have been killed.
Over the next few years, he produced documents that helped some people escape from the country, and allowed others to live in hiding.
In all, they saved about 500 Jews.
Others, including British pilots, also were saved.
Betsalel noted that when someone once asked Klemke about the rescue effort, he responded: "What was so special about it?
They fooled everyone who needed to be fooled.

President Barack Obama recently called for $75 million in new federal spending to help pay for 50,000 body cameras for police across the country.
In some instances, lawmakers are focused on how long departments should have to keep video, and if or when recordings should be made public.
Clearfield, Utah, is a city of about 30,000 located 30 miles north of Salt Lake City.

A little yellow submarine will be the final part of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.
"It is time to go underwater," Australian Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said, announcing the new phase of operations.
"The whole key on these searches is you have to be methodical and persistent, and they can take quite a bit of time," said David Kelly.
If something promising is detected, the sonar can be swapped out for high-definition cameras.
While the robotic sub does its duties, search crews aboard the Ocean Shield and other vessels will have no idea whether it has found anything.
"It doesn\'t transfer any (images) or anything while it\'s down there."
It vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing.
On four occasions, a pinger locator towed by the Ocean Shield picked up transmissions from what investigators strongly suspect were one or both of the black boxes.
It appears investigators have concluded that the batteries on those devices \u2014 which are supposed to last 30 days \u2014 have run out.
Meanwhile, Houston indicated that the so-far unsuccessful search for debris on the ocean surface would probably be called off in the next two to three days.
The final part of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be done by a little yellow submarine.

The final part of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be done by a little yellow submarine.
They planned to send it 2.8 miles down to the seabed and use its side-scanning sonar to look for wreckage from the plane.
"It is time to go underwater," Australian Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said, announcing the new stage of operations.
He is president of Bluefin Robotics, the Massachusetts company that makes the vessel.
The depth at which the Bluefin-21 will work \u2014 2.8 miles \u2014 is hard even for oceanographers to imagine.
The decision to use the Bluefin-21 came on day 38 of the search for the plane.
Searchers 1,300 miles off the western coast of Australia had waited to send out the sub.
But there have been no new signals in the last six days.
They\'re going to, in a couple days, shut down all the air and surface search operations," he added.

The "Paris agreement" aims to keep global temperatures from rising another degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) between now and 2100.
Some delegates wept and others embraced.
In the pact, the countries pledge to eventually limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the level that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally.
In practical terms, achieving that goal means the world would have to stop emitting greenhouse gases \u2014 most of which come from the burning of oil, coal and gas for energy \u2014 altogether in the next half-century.
President Barack Obama said the climate agreement offers "the best chance to save the one planet we have."
The deal commits countries to keeping the rise in global temperatures by the year 2100 "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit),\xa0compared with pre-industrial times.
People held hands beneath the Eiffel Tower and stretched a 1.2-mile-long banner from the Arc de Triomphe to the business district La Defense.
They hailed it for including language that essentially means the world will have to all but stop polluting with greenhouse gases by 2070 to reach the 2-degree goal, or by 2050 to reach the 1.5-degree goal.
In addition to cuts in emissions, the goal could be reached in part by increasing how much carbon dioxide is sucked out of the air by planting forests or with futuristic technology, Oppenheimer said.
Brazilian Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira declared: "Today, we\'ve proven that it\'s possible for every country to come together, hand in hand, to do its part to fight climate change."
More than 180 countries have already presented plans to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
He said it offers "the best chance to save the one planet we have."
Nearly 200 nations have just adopted the first global agreement to fight climate change.
The deal is the first agreement to ask all countries to join the fight against global warming.
The deal commits countries to keeping the rise in global temperatures by the year 2100 "well below"\xa02 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).
It says countries will try to limit them even more, to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Scientist Ben Strauss said limiting warming to 1.5 degrees instead of 2 degrees would make a significant difference.
It could potentially cut in half the number of people whose houses will eventually be submerged by rising seas.
Nearly 200 nations have agreed to work together to fight global warming.

Jewish practice calls for the first candle of eight-day Hanukkah to be lit the night before Thanksgiving Day this year.
While the whole thing is lots of fun, is there anything bigger happening here?
She partnered with an artist and the Jewish gift site Moderntribe to create and sell souvenir T-shirts, cards and a poster.
"It\'s just a day when Jews and the rest of America are celebrating on the same day," she said.
"It\'s an opportunity for us to really celebrate the Jewish American experience, and to give thanks in America for the religious freedom we enjoy here."
The creators of it own the trademark to "Thanksgivukkah."
The interest, Mizrahi said, "has truly blown me away."
This year U.S. Thanksgiving is happening at the same time as Hanukkah.
The rare event has created much excitement.
That means he owns the use of it.
"The Ballad of Thanksgivukkah" goes "Imagine Judah Maccabee, sitting down to roast turkey and passing the potatoes to Squanto..." Rabbi David Paskin helped write the song.
He proudly says his Jewish day school is the closest one to Plymouth Rock.
Jewish practice calls for the first candle to be lit the night before Thanksgiving Day this year.
So, Thanksgivukkah falls on the "second candle" night.
So Jews in the state might have also been lighting their first Hanukkah candle in 1945 and 1956 at the Thanksgiving table.

When she was 4, Doris Pilkington Garimara was taken away by the Australian government.
Years passed before she learned the full story.
At the camp, there were bars on the windows, locks on the doors and buckets for toilets.
They headed toward a fence built to protect farmland from rabbits.
But because the government did not record aboriginal births, her birth date is not known.
Pilkington Garimara grew up thinking, "my mother didn\'t want me and gave me away."
Forget climbing Mount Everest \u2014 for most humans, surviving on the harsh Tibetan plateau would be challenge enough.
The study, published Wednesday, identifies a long section \u2014 or segment \u2014 of DNA shared by the extinct people known as Denisovans and modern-day Tibetans.
Then they sequenced more than 30,000 nucleotides on a segment of DNA containing EPAS1, the gene that makes Tibetans so well-suited for life at high altitude.
"Natural selection by itself could not explain that pattern," said biologist Rasmus Nielsen, an author of the study.
The scientists used computer models to test two different theories.
The reason Tibetans need EPAS1 is that their mountainous home lies about 15,000 feet above sea level, on average.
They know only that it leads to lower levels of hemoglobin \u2014 the oxygen-carrying protein in blood \u2014 in Tibetans who live at high altitude compared with people from low elevations.
But people without the gene tend to "overreact" at high altitudes.
"There are very negative fitness effects of having too many red blood cells, and the Tibetans avoid them."
Anthropologist Abigail Bigham, who was not involved in the study, said now the search for Denisovan DNA should extend to other groups not represented in the Human Genome Diversity Panel.
No one knew the Denisovans ever roamed the Earth until four years ago, when an unusual finger bone was unearthed in southern Siberia.
Like Neanderthals, Denisovans mated with other kinds of humans, scientists soon discovered.
So they investigated whether the gene might have been imported from extinct Neanderthals or Denisovans.
Alternatively, the gene could have entered the Tibetan gene pool more recently through mating.
Indeed, these species are responsible for introducing some of the genetic diversity that allowed people to adapt to unique environments.
"Not only has there been interbreeding, but in fact that interbreeding has led to important" physical changes.
Forget climbing Mount Everest.
Now it appears that Tibetans can trace part of their ancestry to this mysterious group.
They found EPAS1 in only two of the 40 Chinese people they looked at and in no one else.
Were Denisovans and Tibetans descended from a common ancestor that gave EPAS1 to both?
Or did humans get it by mating with Denisovans?
So they investigated whether the gene might have been imported from extinct Neanderthals or Denisovans.
Forget climbing Mount Everest.
The reason Tibetans need EPAS1 is simple: Their mountainous home lies about 15,000 feet above sea level, on average.
The reason Tibetans need EPAS1 is simple: Their mountainous home lies about 15,000 feet above sea level.
It is this, scientists think, that gives Tibetans an advantage over others at high altitudes.
In the new study, scientists collected blood samples from 40 Tibetans.
Early humans and Denisovans probably split off from a common ancestor around half a million years ago.
Once transferred, it would have spread rapidly in the Tibetan population.
The Denisovans died out \u2014 they became extinct \u2014 tens of thousands of years ago.
Having certain genes can put someone at risk of diseases.
The scientists then looked at blood samples from 1,000 non-Tibetans.
Tibet and China border each other, and China rules over Tibet.
There was still one mystery, though: Just how did EPAS1 end up in modern Tibetans?
The reason Tibetans need EPAS1 is simple: Their mountainous home lies about 15,000 feet above sea level.
Now they also knew where it came from.
The bodies of people without EPAS1 react to the low level of oxygen by producing a lot of red blood cells.
Now there is a new study that makes the case that the island is sinking, just very slowly.
More research is needed to better understand how big the tsunami would be, Castillo said.
Castillo says Catalina is sinking around 1 millimeter \u2014 the same as 4 one-hundredths of an inch \u2014 every five years.
A study published in 2012 claimed the island was rising, like many other places in Southern California.
So far, he said, no one has been able to come up with clear evidence of either rising or sinking.
Santa Catalina Island is one of the Channel Islands.

Experts have looked into many ways of making sure an asteroid does not hit our planet.
Some scientists have even suggested attaching huge weights to the asteroid to change its direction.
Using any of those methods requires lots of advance warning.
For this reason, many groups of scientists are also working on better telescopes and ways to track potentially dangerous rocks.
Experts in Russia are researching a new program to defend against space threats.

Electronic cigarettes that emit vapor but not smoke would still be allowed.
The ban would take effect 18 months after the rule is finalized.
The units are in cities including Boston, Seattle, Minneapolis, San Antonio and Detroit.
Smoking would be prohibited outdoors within 25 feet of buildings as well.
"The clock starts today," said Ed Cabrera, a HUD spokesman.
"We just want to make our properties smoke-free so they\'re safer for everyone," he said.
Smoking also would be not be allowed outdoors within 25 feet of buildings.
But I would have to comply with it," said chain smoker Dana Jones, who lives in an apartment complex in downtown Atlanta.
However, Jones said a federal ban would probably force her to finally break her habit.
He does not smoke in his apartment because his son has asthma.
Now, more than 228,000 public housing units are smoke-free.
Philip Morris USA, a major cigarette company, did not comment directly on the proposed rule.
There, it said, people should be able to set their own rules about smoking.
However, homeowners should be able to smoke in their own homes, the company said.
They should be able to make the rules about smoking in the house, the company said.

A federal trademark board, which protects companies from having other companies steal their names and symbols, passed a ruling on Wednesday.
The ruling from the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board was 2-1 for a case that has been working its way through legal channels for more than 20 years.
If it stands, it would mean the team can continue to use the name, but it would lose much of its ability to protect the financial interests connected to it.
"Our job as players is to focus on what we can on this field day-in and day-out and let the legal people take care of that stuff," quarterback Robert Griffin III said.
"It is just a matter of time," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, until Snyder "is forced to do the right thing."
A federal trademark board ruled Wednesday that the Washington Redskins nickname is insulting to [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American).
The Redskins quickly announced that they will appeal, and the ending of trademark protections will be on hold while the matter makes its way through the courts.
"We\'ve seen this story before," Redskins lawyer Bob Raskopf said.
Redskins players have mostly avoided the topic, aware of a possible conflict because they are employed by the team.

In a paper last month in the journal Nature, an international team of scientists sought to sort this out for a particular group of meteorites known as shergottites.
To settle the question, Desmond Moser of Western University in Ontario, Canada had his team examine a meteorite known as Northwest Africa 5298.
These tough, zirconium-rich minerals are "10 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair," said study co-author Axel Schmitt, a geochemist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
By looking at the isotopic ratios of radioactive uranium and lead in this tough rock, the scientists found that it formed about 187 million years ago, give or take 33 million years.
The scientists could also see evidence of the damage done to the meteorite by the event that may have released it from the Martian surface sometime around 22 million years ago.
The shock from that impact muddled up the mineral structure inside, while keeping the chemicals themselves mostly intact.
Until then, they have to settle for examining meteorites \u2014 chunks of the Red Planet that land on Earth after hurtling through space.

Lawmakers and clothing chains are taking a long, hard look at the human cost of cheap clothes after a deadly building collapse in Bangladesh.
The eight-story Rana Plaza factory complex crumbled on April 24 with nearly 3,000 workers trapped inside.
Another worker, Sonia Akthar, was sewing a shirt when the ceiling collapsed on her, Al-Jazeera reported.
Her leg became trapped under heavy concrete, and rescuers were forced to take off her leg to save her.
When a doctor was too scared to go into the wrecked building, 30-year-old worker Didar Hossein went in on his own.
Nineteen-year-old Reshma Begum survived 17 days in the rubble with nothing but four packets of cookies and a little water.
The building owner, Mohammed Sohel Rana, was arrested trying to flee the country.
He is a local politician, but was also well known as a neighborhood gangster.
On Tuesday, survivors of the collapse protested near the factory site.
The factory industry has provided many much-needed jobs, especially for women.
Western companies choose Bangladesh for its low wages and fast production.
But the cheap cost and quick delivery comes at a human cost: factories often use child workers, and forced pregnant women to work until just before their due dates.
Target, Gap and J.C. Penney met with workers rights groups last week to discuss safety conditions.
But some do not believe that Western brands will help, since they are the ones demanding quick, cheap production from the factories.
"How can a garment businessman keep up with this ever-increasing demand?"
"I am troubled by the deafening silence from other apparel retailers on this issue," said Galen Weston, the chairman of Loblaw, a Canadian company that used the Rana Plaza factory to make its clothes.
There are rumors the construction workers built the factory with shoddy materials and cut safety corners because they knew Rana would not pay for them.
However, with hundreds of bodies still being pulled from the rubble, the Bangladeshi workers themselves may demand change.
Weeks after a clothing factory collapsed in Bangladesh, rescuers are still pulling out bodies.

Spencer Hawes has spent seven times as long playing basketball professionally for the NBA as he spent playing at the University of Washington.
"No offense to some of the sciences and humanities and whatnot," Hawes said, "but it\'s not really my passion."
"You\'re so busy during the season and when you finally get time off, it\'s like, do you want to go to school or actually spend time with your family?"
He said he would prefer to take courses in the summer, meaning it could take seven or eight seasons to get his diploma.

The usual scenario in expensive stores involves suspicious glances, inattentive clerks or rude service.
Shopping while black, they say, can be an upsetting experience.
Oprah Winfrey once complained that a Swiss clerk did not think she could afford a $38,000 handbag, and even President Barack Obama has said he was once followed in stores.
"You can\'t assume it doesn\'t happen just because it doesn\'t happen to you," she said.
In a lawsuit filed last week, the 19-year-old said that he bought a Ferragamo belt at the store, but when he left he was stopped by undercover city police officers.
He was arrested and detained, though he showed police the receipt, the bank card he used and identification, the lawsuit said.
For Yvonne Chan, the reports were a painful reminder of when she worked in a liquor store in a mostly white Massachusetts town.
Those biased views can affect who gets arrested for theft, said Jerome Williams, a business professor at Rutgers University.
The figures that show that black customers steal more "are not really an indication of who\'s shoplifting," Williams said.
Graham said a few months ago a black cashier started talking to black women standing in line behind her about their order.
Toni Duclottni, who runs a fashion web site in Los Angeles, recently went to a department store intending to spend about $4,000 on shoes.
"They rush to judgment, they jump into it assuming something without speaking to a person," she said.
"They\'d be surprised if they just walked up and said, "Hello, can I help you find something?\'"
Sometimes, it takes clerks more than five minutes to simply acknowledge her, she said.

Experts at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam authenticated the 1888 landscape "Sunset at Montmajour" with the help of Vincent Van Gogh\'s letters.
It was painted during the period when Van Gogh was increasingly adopting the thick "impasto" brush strokes that became typical of his work in the final years of his short life.
The painting disappeared from history until it reappeared in 1970 in the estate of Norwegian industrialist Christian Nicolai Mustad.
The Mustad family said he purchased it in 1908 as a young man in one of his first forays into art collecting, but was soon told by the French ambassador to Sweden that it was a fake.
"That may be a painful admission, given that the same museum is now attributing it to Van Gogh, but it is understandable," The Burlington Magazine article said.
He said his predecessors might also have been confused because the painting was done at a "transitional" moment in Van Gogh\'s style.
But when the museum took a fresh look at the work in 2011, its experts had the advantage of a new collection of all Van Gogh\'s letters, and they were able to identify for the first time the exact location "Sunset" depicts: Montmajour hill, near Arles.
Van Gogh mentioned the painting in two other letters that same summer.
At an unveiling ceremony, museum director Axel Rueger called the discovery a "once-in-a-lifetime experience."
He said previous experts might also have been confused because the painting was done at a "transitional" moment in Van Gogh\'s style.
The roughly 37-by-29-inch "Sunset at Montmajour" shows a dry landscape of twisting oak trees, bushes and sky.

Police in Ferguson, Missouri, used U.S. military equipment during protests this summer.
Now, President Barack Obama is ordering up new rules for giving local police agencies such weapons.
The proposal includes $75 million that would help buy as many as 50,000 cameras.
For example, there is no clear sign that all police are correctly trained and ready to use the military equipment they receive.
The results of the review came a week after a grand jury in St. Louis County chose not to bring the Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson, to trial.
It also brought attention to the use of military equipment by local law enforcement officials.
The White House will give an order to the Pentagon and all other federal agencies that run the surplus programs.
At the top of the agenda was finding ways to build trust between police and communities.
Obama told his staff to help resolve the issue.
It requires officials who are not police to review and approve any equipment, such as small arms and armored vehicles, before it can be sent to their communities.
In addition, Obama is setting up a task force to come up with ideas for fighting crime while still building public trust.

Widely mocked as young and naive at the time, the 24-year-old songwriter used the national newspaper to share her hopeful view.
However, in the Wall Street Journal piece, Swift had important points to make about the business of music.
Many in the music industry see streaming as the only hope for growth.
Rather than letting you own your collection, the music business is moving toward a model similar to on-demand cable TV or Netflix.
Bands can make money by putting on concerts, but it also gives fans a chance to make a human connection with the artists they love.
Swift has proved herself an expert at forging those connections.

"Snakebites," said lead author Luis Fernando Chaves, "don\'t get the attention they deserve, even though they are a major problem."
After all, snakebites affect 2.5 million people around the world annually, and 400,000 suffer serious medical consequences such as nerve damage or amputations and 85,000 of them will die.
They rely on the environment to regulate their body temperature, which means their behavior might be highly influenced by the changing weather patterns induced by climate change.
Finally, Costa Rica is in just the right spot to experience some serious weather pattern changes thanks to a phenomenon known as El Nino Southern Oscillation.
This snakebite increase seems more likely to affect people living in poor, rural areas, Chaves said.
This means their behavior might be highly influenced by the changing weather patterns induced by climate change.
This is probably because snakes become more active and might wander farther as it gets warmer, perhaps running into humans in the process.
"So this raises the question of, OK, what do you do to decrease the risk of the people that are worse off economically," Chaves said.
The findings of the study were reported in the journal Science Advances.
The study shows both effects on animal populations and the way climate change affects human disease for people with different amounts of money.
This means their behavior might be highly influenced by the changing weather patterns induced by climate change.
The reason could be that snakes have to venture farther out of their comfort zone in search of food.
The voice from the Internet ad is confident: No one will suspect anything, he says.
Anil, a medical student in southern India, was selling a tiny wireless earpiece, scarcely bigger than the head of a pin.
"There\'s no way anyone can even make out you using the device," says Anil, who imports the earpieces from the United States and sells three or four a week on eBay to high school and college students.
Some schools have installed closed-circuit cameras to monitor testing rooms.
Still, India\'s national elections, which began this month, "are likely to be freer and fairer than the exams," journalist Mridula Chari wrote.
But some say the problem became worse after a 2010 policy that guaranteed schooling for all children up to age 14.
No student can be held back until the eighth grade or forced to take a board exam until the 10th grade.
"One hundred percent, we can stop this problem," said Lakshmikant Pande, chairman of the board of education in the western state of Maharashtra.
Veteran teachers remain doubtful, saying that school principals often are reluctant to report cheating for fear of damaging their reputations.
They also said there is little incentive for a teacher to testify to a cheating case, which can trigger a time-consuming formal investigation.
About a decade ago, the son of a senior Indian Railways official hired a train conductor to take an exam for him.
Yet long after his graduation, the case remains before the police and the teacher who nabbed the cheat is forced to appear at least once a year at a court proceeding.
"We learned a lesson from that," said an English teacher, Akhil Bhosle.
The voice from the Internet ad sounds confident: No one will suspect anything, he says.
He texts pictures of the test questions to a friend at home and receives answers over the phone.
"There\'s no way anyone can even make out you using the device," says Anil, who sells three or four a week on eBay to high school and college students.

Even for those not attending college, test results are important for entering job training programs.
But for every contraption like the one Anil was selling, more extreme examples of cheating come to light once exam season begins each February.
At a school in Allahabad, in northern India, members of an inspection team were attacked with bombs last month.
Upset, he doused himself with kerosene, a type of fuel, and set himself on fire in the family kitchen.

For 150 years, baseball has been played without a clock.
Baseball games have increased in length in the past few decades.
The time of an average game has increased from 2 hours, 23 minutes in 1950 to more than three hours this season.
Strikeouts have steadily increased for the entire previous century and especially in the past 10 seasons.
Through Oct. 24, nine-inning games under the new rules averaged 2 hours, 20 minutes, while nine-inning games without clock rules averaged 2:49.
Whether the experimental rules move to the major leagues, and to what extent, remains unclear.
There have never been clocks in baseball.
"Really, it\'s kind of a lot of time," Tyler Glasnow, a fall league pitcher, said.
It could soon have a pitch clock, a pitching-change clock, and an inning-break clock.
Umpires could charge pitchers with automatic balls and batters with automatic strikes.
Teams averaged 5.14 runs per game in 2000, the highest total since 1936.
The fastest pitchers, like Mark Buehrle of the Toronto Blue Jays and Doug Fister of the Washington Nationals, take about 18 seconds between pitches.
Pitchers will be charged with a ball if they take too long, while batters will take an automatic strike if they take too long.
"Really, it\'s kind of a lot of time," Tyler Glasnow, a fall league pitcher, said.
In the spring of 2010, a lone gray whale was spotted off the Mediterranean coast of Israel.
Marine mammals, such as whales or seals, are often physically prevented from moving through the Arctic by sea ice, which gets in the way of their swimming or\xa0prohibits\xa0them\xa0from coming up to breathe.
While no one can say for sure what consequences these movements will have, McKeon and his team discuss a number of possible outcomes in their paper.
One example the authors considered is the Great American Biotic Interchange, which occurred several million years ago when a thin strip of land called the isthmus of Panama formed between North and South America.
As a result, mammals from North America invaded South America and outcompeted many of the native species there for resources.
This can help inform conservation tactics moving forward, including the need for updated international conservation agreements.
Gray whales live in the Pacific Ocean.
As a result, mammals from North America invaded South America and outcompeted many of the native species there for food or ate them.
However, she noted that as more animals pass through the Arctic, "new environmental protections may need to be put in place."
At this point, scientists can only wait and see.
Toyota Motor Corp. has big ambitions to become a significant player in the growing market for robots that can help the elderly and other people in everyday life.
Toyota last month announced a $1 billion investment in a company headed by a robotics expert in Silicon Valley to develop artificial intelligence and robotics.
"We are preparing for a future in which people may not be able to drive cars, or they may need artificial intelligence to support them to drive," said Akifumi Tamaoki, the general manager of Toyota\'s partner robot division.
Some of that impetus comes from the focus of the auto and tech industries on using artificial intelligence to develop cars that can drive by themselves.

But U.S. tour operators who specialize in large group tours say that the main attractions in Los Angeles continue to be theme parks, Hollywood, excursions to Las Vegas and Yosemite, and spending sprees in luxury shops and outlet malls.
I think it\'s a shame it\'s not featured in the (tours) right now," said Harry Chen, owner of Joy Holiday, a San Francisco Bay Area company that regularly runs tours of Los Angeles.
Even without the big tour groups, the Getty and other art museums have a chance to attract increasing numbers of Chinese visitors, though more likely by the carload than the busload.
Providing museum audio tours in Chinese and adding Chinese dishes to menus at food courts are also desirable but not required.
The Getty estimates it hands out about 100 audio devices daily that provide a guide to the museum in Mandarin.

As an outbreak of measles spreads in California, health officials in the state ordered about two dozen students at one high school to stay home until they could prove they have been vaccinated against the disease.
Spread by coughing and sneezing, measles can be contagious four days before the rash appears and four days after.
Still, some parents choose not to give their children that shot, and others, because of personal beliefs.
At S. A. Moffett Elementary, 10 percent were not vaccinated as of 2013.
In 1977, about 50,000 students in Los Angeles County were told to stay home from school.
Within days, most returned to school, and the number of measles cases dropped quickly.
The outbreak worries her, though, and she said she is going to get her daughter vaccinated next month.
"It was a hard decision," she said.

As theme park lines get longer, parks like Disney World in Florida are investing big money to make wait time less boring, more comfortable, and seemingly shorter.
"If you reduce the wait, whether real or perceived, it is critical," said Jim MacPhee, senior vice president at Walt Disney World Parks.

It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to harm other people to get his or her hands on a gun.
So how can you make the argument that more guns will make us safer?
If you think this is a problem, then you should expect the lawmakers you vote for to share your views.

Have you noticed a difference in the appearance of United States presidents and the runners-up who lost the election?
The findings might even whittle the huge pool of Republicans vying for the job.
Dr. Michael Roizen, a preventive medicine specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, has asserted that the typical president ages two years for every year he is in office.
He found\xa0that 23 of these 34 presidents "lived beyond the average life expectancy for men of the same age when they were inaugurated, even if they hypothetically aged at twice the normal rate while in office."
Last year, a paper conducted a thorough test of "male idiot theory" and concluded that, indeed, men are idiots.
The latest research adds to a surprisingly robust line of research: whether winning awards, honors and elections actually confers a long life.
The nations studied were Austria, Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United States.
When comparing the appearance of United States presidents with the runners-up who did not win the election, the difference is clear.
Two months ago Sarah and Ysra Mardini were swimming for their lives.
Ysra, now 17, even swam for Syria at the short-course world championships in Turkey in 2012.
"But if we stay there we will not reach that because the situation is not OK in Syria."
Her older sister, Sarah, is battling government rules to bring the rest of the family to Germany.

In 1794, a Portuguese ship taking about 400 slaves from Mozambique to Brazil crashed on the rocks off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa.
The museum has already collected important slave-related items, such as iron shackles for a child, a bill of sale for a 10-year-old slave boy and a 19th-century slave cabin from Edisto Island, South Carolina.
Like those pieces, the objects from the S\xe3o Jos\xe9 will personalize the "grand historical story" of slavery, curator Paul Gardullo said.
The loan agreement represents a milestone for the Slave Wreck Project, a global effort launched in 2008 to study the slave trade through the discovery and archaeological study of shipwrecks.
In 2008, researchers with the Slave Wreck Project chose the site as its pilot project and began to explore the underwater location and conduct research in the records of cities it was thought to have visited.
Officials involved in the project are in Cape Town this week for a series of discussions and workshops about the deep-sea archaeological effort.

The artifacts represent a significant addition to the newest Smithsonian museum, which is set to open next year in Washington, D.C. "I\'m not attempting to tell a narrative," Bunch said.
He added that, while the ballast and pulley block are simple objects, they can still help visitors think about slavery in an emotional way.

Women make up 14 percent of the active duty military.
The Pentagon says 152 female troops have been killed while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Serving in a combat unit is a stepping-stone to higher rank and leadership positions.
Soldiers who drive fuel trucks, provide medical support or even sort mail can come under fire in this kind of modern warfare.
Sixty-six percent of people polled by the Pew Research Center said women should be allowed to serve in fighting units.
Both women and men were equally supportive of the change, but older Americans were less in favor of women serving in combat than were younger Americans.
Nearly half of those surveyed said the decision would make no difference in the effectiveness of the military.
According to The New York Times, the Pentagon does not plan to lower its fitness requirements.

Inside a building next to Lake Michigan, the Civil War rages on.
Using 360-degree technology and 11-foot-tall screens, the museum this month opened an 11-minute movie called "Seeing the Elephant."
"Our idea was to produce a 360-degree film that puts the viewer in the middle of the action, sort of a living, breathing cyclorama," said museum curator Doug Dammann.
The panoramic paintings were first developed in Europe before migrating to the United States in the 1880s.
A handful of cycloramas can still be seen more than 125 years later, including one in Gettysburg, Pa., and another in Atlanta.
Plans got underway last year for the $1 million film, which was funded through private donations.
Old World Wisconsin was the location chosen for filming, particularly the Norwegian farmstead area, Catholic church and town hall.
The theater features eight projectors, and seven speakers above viewers plus speakers underneath the platform and LED lighting.
Using 360-degree technology and 11-foot-tall screens, the museum is presenting an 11-minute movie called "Seeing the Elephant."
A special 360-degree camera, which was actually nine high-definition digital cameras attached to a periscope rig, was used to film the battle scenes.
Much of the dialogue of the three main characters joining the Union Army was authentic, Herdegen said.
It was chosen because "seeing the elephant" was a common phrase used by Civil War soldiers to describe their first experience of battle.

The justices said in a 6-3 ruling that the subsidies do not depend on where people live, as opponents contended.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, who objected to the law in 2012, was part of the majority on Thursday.
Limiting the subsidies could well push insurance markets in the other states "into a death spiral," Roberts wrote.
Scalia said these "will publish forever the discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites."
Nationally, 10.2 million people have signed up for health insurance under the law.
That includes the 8.7 million people who are receiving an average subsidy of $272 a month to help pay their insurance bills.
In the challengers\' view, the phrase "established by the state" meant that people could only get subsidies in states that set up their own exchanges.
It requires almost everyone to be insured and provides financial help to consumers who otherwise would spend too much of their paychecks on insurance bills.
The Supreme Court on Thursday issued a ruling that preserves health insurance for millions of Americans.
At the court, Chief Justice John Roberts again voted with his liberal colleagues in support of the law.
He said "the Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites."
Obama, Democrats in Congress and 22 states responded that it would make no sense to interpret the law that way.
The point of the subsidies is to make sure enough people have insurance.
Some states told the court that they had no idea they had to set up their own health insurance marketplaces for their residents to get help.
The Supreme Court on Thursday preserved the health insurance of millions of Americans.
Republicans have voted more than 50 times to undo the law.

A major investigation of art hanging in Dutch museums has just been completed and the results are unexpected: 139 works may have once been Nazi loot from World War II.
All Dutch museums with art from before the war participated in the review.
The museums said they are contacting or seeking the heirs, including those of Jewish art dealer Albert Stern.
Other paintings included works by other well known painters such as Impressionist Isaac Israels and Modernists like Wassily Kandinsky.
They declared that "every effort should be made to publicize art that is found to have been confiscated by the Nazis" and have it returned.
Many American and British museums have already conducted thorough investigations that have led to the return of looted art.
The first one in 2006 focused only on works that were bought and sold during the war.
"We\'re not the first with this investigation, but thanks to this investigation we\'re not far behind," said Rudi Ekkart, a professor of art history at the University of Utrecht.
"While I applaud the Dutch for doing this, I also have to say: where were you all this time?"
Russia rejects the Washington Principles, calling art taken during World War II its rightful "trophies."
Switzerland endorses the principles in theory, but has not conducted through research and turns a blind eye to the possibility of looted art hidden in its bank vaults, Marinello said.
STERDAM - A major investigation of art hanging in Dutch museums just concluded.

"Over the past two weeks we have noted a significant escalation in both the level and sophistication of Russia\'s military interference in Ukraine," Tak said.
"We have also detected large quantities of advanced weapons, including air defense systems, artillery, tanks, and armored personnel carriers," he said.
He said in an interview on Russian television that 3,000 to 4,000 Russians have fought on the separatist side since the conflict began in April.
The tank\'s presence, Dempsey said, "strongly supports the contention that Russia is supplying arms to separatist forces."
Russian forces, she said, are being sent inside Ukraine without them or their families knowing where they are going.

U.S. government spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that Russia was hiding its actions, even from its own people.
That changed in April when the Army issued rules about how women in uniform can wear their hair, along with regulations about tattoos.
The rules ban certain hairstyles, including twists, large cornrow braids and dreadlocks, that are popular among black women.
That hit a nerve already made sensitive by generations of debate within the black community over what is "good" or "bad" hair.
The Army says the rules are needed to ensure a "uniformity" of appearance as well as soldiers\' ability to wear headgear unimpeded by their hair.
"But she feels bad that she had to be put in the position where she was made to do this."
However, on Tuesday, Hagel directed the military to rethink the new policies.
The new rules also outlaw tattoos on the face, neck, lower arms and hands.
She figured going natural would be healthier, safer and easier to take care of.
"They have to admit they were uneducated, and say they made a mistake," Jacobs said.
"I never had anyone say anything to me about my hair," Jacobs said.
They asked Chuck Hagel to rethink the hair rule.
She stopped about four years ago.
They were not meant to be hurtful, Hagel wrote to the black lawmakers.

As storms have flooded the village of Chandipur with seawater, the soil there has become increasingly salty.
The situation became particularly bad after Cyclone Aila in 2009, which brought storm surges that broke embankments and flooded farmland.
"There is no country with such population density where natural resources are stretched to their very limits," says Craig Meisner, the country director for Bangladesh at WorldFish, an international nonprofit organization headquartered in Malaysia.
WorldFish has been building vertical gardens in southern Bangladesh, along with other means of coping with climate change.
Working with local nonprofits, WorldFish trained about 200 villagers in four districts in southwestern Bangladesh to make vertical gardens.
Finding enough fresh water for her new gardens is a challenge, she admits.

Yet they live in an area about the size of Iowa.
Growing enough food for all of those people is already a challenge.
Working with local groups, WorldFish trained about 200 villagers in southwestern Bangladesh to make vertical gardens.
At that time of year, soil tends to be less salty because heavy rains from July to October wash salt away.
Small containers, which cost around $1.30 to $2.00, can produce up to 17 1/2 pounds of vegetables in one season.
Larger containers can produce more than 220 pounds of vegetables, at a cost of around $11.50 to $13.00.

For the past three years, however, hundreds of villagers have found a new way to farm.
This way, the gardens can make it through a storm without being destroyed.
Shakuri Rani Debnath, who lives in Chandipur, says her vertical gardens produced more than 400 pounds of vegetables this summer.
Her fruits and vegetables included pumpkins, squash, cauliflower, tomatoes, spinach and chili peppers.
Vertical gardens were brought to villages like Chandipur by WorldFish.
Growing a vertical garden is easy.
It is in a small corner of her dirt yard.
Nevertheless, each season it produces hundreds of pounds of pumpkins, gourds, green beans, eggplant, beets, carrots, cauliflower, coriander, cabbage, green chili peppers and spinach.

"Teaching them to show respect to each other is more effective than saying, \'Don\'t be a bully,\'" said Brian Meyer.
Under the program, schools recognize that all students are capable of bullying and being bullied.
Then all teachers and students are trained in a approach called "Stop, Walk and Talk."
But as bullying was blamed in shootings and suicides, parents started asking for help and state lawmakers got involved, said Dorothy Espelage.
When the network began 15 years ago, it focused on students with special needs or severe disciplinary problems.

They have discovered how the individual insects link their bodies together to create these remarkably strong yet lightweight structures.
This knowledge, described in a paper in the Journal of Experimental Biology, may one day help engineers build self-healing buildings and bridges.
A recent study found that ants place their babies at the bottom of a raft to make it better able to float.
Instead, researchers at Georgia Tech managed to capture its complex structure using a micro CT scanner, which is typically used to image the tiny 3-D structure of bones.
They did this four times, for a total of 440 ants and 2,640 legs, since each ant has six limbs.
While most of the ants could have a maximum of five connections, some ants were about three times larger and could connect up to 20 legs.
By creating these big spaces between each connected ant, the insects were making their raft more porous, and thus less dense.
Self-healing buildings and ships, able to quickly respond to changes in the environment, may sound like technology from the future.

The ants sure knew how to get a grip on each other.
By creating big spaces between each connected ant, the insects made their raft lighter, and thus less dense.
But for the ants, "this is an ancient thing," Hu said.
With "more parking spots for little legs," as Hu put it, their enormous bodies acted as hubs for the ant legs.

They then flash-froze the ants in place and examined them under the scanner.
They found, to their surprise, that 99 percent of the ant legs were linked, while only 26 of them remained unconnected.
The scientists also found that the ants positioned themselves at a 90-degree angle to each other.
While most of the ants could make five connections at most, some ants were about three times larger and could connect to 20 different legs.
With "more parking spots for little legs," as Hu put it, their enormous bodies acted as hubs for limbs.
By creating big spaces between each connected ant, the insects made their raft lighter, and thus less dense.
Fire ants may be famous for their painful sting.
They have discovered that the insects link their bodies together to create strong yet lightweight structures.

Now, scientists are able to peer into the heart of fire-ant rafts.
They have discovered that the insects link their bodies together to create strong yet lightweight structures.
Instead of nailing those beams together, they reach out and touch each other.
"It\'s like their bodies are covered in Velcro," said David Hu.
But the scanner is way too big.
They froze the ants in place and then examined them under the scanner.
The scientists also found that the ants placed themselves on a 90-degree angle to each other.
By creating these big spaces between each connected ant, the insects made their raft lighter and less dense.
Hu said the ant raft was quite a bit like bone in that way.
It makes the rafts better able to float.
All those ant bodies were blocking the view.
These ants sure knew how to get a grip on each other.
The discovery may one day help engineers build buildings and bridges that can fix themselves.
Scientists are just beginning to understand how amazing ant architecture really is.
Then they froze the ants in place and examined them under the scanner.
In buildings, hubs are key points of strength.
Not having enough money can be hard on children.
The Common Core, a set of tougher classroom standards in more than 40 states, has further angered the critics.
"We need fewer, better and fairer assessments," said Susie Morrison, chief education officer and deputy superintendent at the Illinois State Board of Education.
"Some assessments used by local districts can and should go away, in our opinion."
"This is not a valid way to measure an entire child," said Jensen, a former teacher with two children in high school.
"None of this has anything to do with better education."

This spring, Congress will discuss education  as lawmakers attempt to rewrite a 2002 law.
It required testing students every year to make sure that they were learning what they were supposed to.
It would give states, not the government, the job of ensuring that schools are doing good work.
Meanwhile, complaints this year about the amount of testing have, if anything, grown greater.
She is the chief education officer and deputy superintendent at the Illinois State Board of Education.
She said that parents deserve to know how their children are doing in school.
Testing makes it clear what students know and do not know before they get to that point, she said.
"None of this has anything to do with better education," she said.
In her own family, Jensen said, her son is a good student but a poor test-taker, while her daughter does well on tests.
Jensen said the tests say more about the students than the teachers.
This spring, Congress will discuss education as lawmakers attempt to rewrite a 2002 law.
An agreement in the Senate about the education bill might reduce the pressure on schools to test.

A large number of students graduate from high school but need extra help before college.
Schools need to be able to help students who are not keeping up, she said.
That has led some Illinois community colleges to experiment with a new model.

Still, math literacy appears bound to catch on.
Almy said she hoped the math literacy programs will make education more practical.
Kelsey Pearsall-Brandon, 20, wants to be a police officer.
"Eventually we\'ll have most if not all colleges doing this," said Brian Durham.
She must take a make-up math class to learn the skills she should have learned in high school.
Also, students who study science or technology need to learn more advanced math.
This time, the frontier is outer space and the regulators are from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which licenses commercial-rocket launches in addition to monitoring the airlines.
This past week, at a congressional hearing and an industry conference in Washington, FAA officials and space attorneys began seriously discussing rules of the road for outer space.
There have been some broad guidelines \u2014 the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, for example, prohibits nations from claiming the moon.
Of particular interest is a law \u2014 due to be phased out next year \u2014 that largely bars the FAA from restricting commercial efforts to launch humans into space.
With the FAA sidelined in part by the congressional restriction, the task of crafting regulations for space travel increasingly could fall to NASA.
Space law is not an area in which the courts have carved much ground, either in the United States or internationally.
Of particular interest is the law that largely bars the FAA from restricting commercial efforts to launch humans into space.
Because of that, Boeing lawyer Russ McMurry said regulators and lawyers might consider looking at laws once written for wooden ships.
In 2012, SpaceX became the first commercial-rocket company to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, for example, prohibits nations from claiming the moon.
U.S. Rep. Steven Palazzo, a Republican from Mississippi, argued Tuesday that the law is still needed.
He said he fears what would happen "if the FAA begins trampling on these companies with regulations."
With the FAA sidelined, the task of crafting regulations for space travel increasingly could fall to NASA.
But the private space industry has grown rapidly in recent years.
The FAA has so far been very limited in what it can do: Once a spacecraft reaches orbit, it is largely free of regulation.
The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, for example, prevents nations from claiming the moon.
But space rules have been few and far between.
For example, how to limit the amount of dangerous "space junk" shed by spacecraft.

Congressman Steven Palazzo says the law is still needed.
Rules are going to be made, said Mike Gold of Bigelow Aerospace.

High school junior Zach Comer was among the students who took part in the rally last Thursday morning.
Chet Morley graduated from Christiansburg High this year and is now attending the Berklee School of Music in Boston.
Although his classmates said the flag symbolized their pride in their Confederate roots, Morley said it made him think of slavery.
Referring to the Confederate battle flag, he said, "As for me and my ancestors, it means more than that."
Students are barred from wearing any clothing that could "reflect adversely on persons due to race."
She said that half of all American middle schools and high schools do not allow the display of the Confederate flag.
High school junior Zach Comer was among the students who took part in the demonstration last Thursday morning.
Morley said he saw students wear clothing with the Confederate battle flag during his time at the school.
Teachers sometimes pointed out that it was against the dress code, but others overlooked it.
Morley, who is black, said seeing the flag bothered him, but he never said anything around his white classmates.

Teaching students alternatives to violence and improving their access to mental-health services are among the ideas officials say they have for preventing school shootings and stabbings that have plagued the U.S.
Researcher Manny Sethi, a trauma surgeon and a Vanderbilt professor, said it may be necessary to teach those problem-solving skills before the high school years.
"The logical response to all of this is to recognize that schools are the first line of defense for mental-health supports for students and to recognize that we are at a shortage" for school counselors, said Julia Szarko, president of the Association of School Psychologists in Pennsylvania.
Szarko said the School District of Philadelphia last year eliminated all of its school counselors to save enough money to maintain its academic program.
"Politicians often aren\'t specific about these plans because it sounds good, but they are not willing to pay for it," said Berkowitz, also a psychiatry professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., has been encouraging Congress to overhaul mental-health services.
After reviewing data on 27 programs, he and his team decided to try one of them in a violence-plagued Nashville middle school.
Sethi said the exercises helped students in "understanding conflict and how it progresses and how to get yourself out of it."
Students reported that they were less likely than before to be a target of bullying, and less likely to hit or push others.
Instead of tailoring safety plans to their campuses, school officials often use generic plans.
A long list of schools have been struck by violent student attacks in recent years.
But mental-health professionals in Pennsylvania schools say funding cuts in recent years have prompted reductions in school counselors, social workers and psychologists \u2014 doctors who treat mental illnesses.
"Politicians often aren\'t specific about these plans because it sounds good, but they are not willing to pay for it," said Berkowitz.

If passed, it would attempt to improve access to mental-health care by integrating it into the practices of doctors.
He says this offers many opportunities to step in to fix mental-health problems before they become a crisis.

In 2013, mediators visited the small town of Geneva, New York, after an officer shot a black man, and demonstrators gathered in front of the police department.
New studies from the Center for American Progress and the National Education Association (NEA) are calling attention to this "diversity gap" at U.S. elementary and secondary schools.
It becomes easier for students to believe "when they can look and see someone who looks just like them, that they can relate to," Gilbert said.
"It\'s important for our social fabric, for our sense as a nation, that students are engaging with people who think, talk and act differently than them but can also be just as effective at raising student achievement in the classroom."
Jan Alderson, a science teacher at Shawnee Mission South High School in Overland Park, Kan., saw the changes at her school.
But as the county integrated and other professions opened their ranks, education lost its "cachet."

Americans are expected to spend as much as $25 billion a year on genetic tests by the end of the decade.
It can also see whether a person is a carrier of a disease and if there is a risk of passing it to his or her children.
The cost of genetic testing varies widely, from $99 for home kits to thousands of dollars for tests at hospitals.
Critics say these tests are limited in their ability to find health risks accurately.
So they could lead users to undergo unnecessary medical treatment.
Doctors say the testing can be very effective in determining the best medicines for particular diseases.

Among them were how much students valued their popularity, how important appearance was in seeking out friends, and if students used drugs or had romantic relationships.
The researchers found that young teens who acted old for their age by forming early romantic relationships, shoplifting and basing friendships on appearance were seen by peers as popular.
But as these "pseudomature" teens matured, things changed: Their behavior was no longer linked with popularity.
Instead, they were thought to be less socially skilled by their peers, said Joseph Allen, who led the study.

onetime point of pride for the New England Patriots has suddenly turned against the NFL franchise.
For three seasons, the move paid off, with Hernandez reaching the Pro Bowl in 2011 and receiving a five-year contract extension worth as much as $40 million.
Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in the death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd and is being held without bail in a Massachusetts jail.
To further distance itself from him, the team took the unprecedented step of a jersey exchange.
Fans with used Hernandez jerseys were allowed to swap them for those of any other player on the roster.
"Without question, the owners are talking to their general managers as soon as this happened, saying, \'Let\'s make sure this doesn\'t happen to us,\'" said former NFL coach Jimmy Johnson.
"There are probably going to be some players that are able to get on the straight and narrow who are going to be bypassed because people are going to be afraid of getting into a situation like this."
He added, "Talent is the overriding factor in the NFL.
He failed drug tests and had run-ins with the law in college.
A scouting service that prepares confidential psychological profiles of NFL prospects determined that he enjoyed "living on the edge of acceptable behavior."
"That was his downfall in Denver, the ability to interact."
"It\'s like (Clarett) was upset with us for drafting him."
"But for the most part they\'re not going to give you what people are wanting, which is a top-to-bottom full report on a guy\'s character, his police blotter, all that kind of stuff."
He said typically clubs do not hire private investigators but instead rely on their area scouts to obtain background information on prospects.

The test found that Hernandez "may be prone to partying too much and doing questionable things that could be seen as a problem for him and his team."
Otherwise, if it\'s a young scout that goes in there, they\'re going to protect their reputation and their head coach, and the fact that they recruited a knucklehead."

President Barack Obama said Tuesday that the U.S. will do everything it can to help Nigeria find nearly [300 teenage girls](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Nigerian+schoolgirls).
"In the short term our goal is obviously is to help the international community, and the Nigerian government, as a team to do everything we can to recover these young ladies," Obama said.
Obama said the U.S. has long sought to work with Nigeria to stop Boko Haram.
They\'ve been killing people ruthlessly for many years now and we\'ve already been seeking greater cooperation with the Nigerians," Obama said.
And that "may be the event that helps to mobilize the entire international community to finally do something against this horrendous organization that\'s perpetrated such a terrible crime," Obama said.
No U.S. armed forces are being sent, Carney noted.
The statement added that Nigeria\'s security forces are working at "full capacity" to find the girls and welcomes the addition of American anti-terrorist "know-how and expertise."
"But we\'re also going to have to deal with the broader problem of organizations like this that ... can cause such (chaos) in people\'s day-to-day lives," Obama said of Boko Haram.

These were some of his first public comments about the kidnapping.
The kidnapping has caused anger around the world.
A total of 276 girls remain missing.
"As a father of two girls, I can\'t imagine what their parents are going through."
And that may get the world to stop "this horrendous organization," Obama said.
But repeated offers of U.S. help were ignored.
A bad case of "affluenza" may be keeping a wealthy Texas teen out of prison for a fatal drunk driving crash.
The term "affluenza" was popularized in the late 1990s by Jessie O\'Neill, the granddaughter of a former president of General Motors, in her book "The Golden Ghetto: The Psychology of Affluence."
"Essentially what (the judge) has done is slapped this child on the wrist for what is obviously a very serious offense which he would be responsible for in any other situation," Buffone said.
A message left for Boyd by The Associated Press was not returned.
"It doesn\'t sound like something that would (reduce) the punishment."
"What is the likelihood if this was an African-American, inner-city kid that grew up in a violent neighborhood to a single mother who is addicted to crack and he was caught two or three times," Luther asked.
Authorities said the teen and friends were seen on video stealing two cases of beer from a store.
They were Brian Jennings, 43, Breanna Mitchell, 24, Shelby Boyles, 21, and her mother, Hollie Boyles, 52.
Instead, the judge "fashioned a sentence that could have him under the thumb of the justice system for the next 10 years," he said.
A Texas teen may have avoided being sent to prison for a drunk driving crash that killed four people because he suffered from having too much money.
Police said Ethan and his friends were seen on video stealing two cases of beer from a store.
Instead, the judge gave him a punishment that could keep him being under heavy supervision for the next 10 years, he said.
Ethan Couch is a rich 16-year-old.
Instead, Ethan will be under heavy supervision for the next 10 years, he said.
Last week, a Fort Worth judge sentenced 16-year-old Ethan Couch to 10 years of supervision after Ethan killed four people while he was driving drunk.
District Judge Jean Boyd has not publicly explained the reason behind the decision not to send Ethan to jail.
She said her research has shown that nearly a fourth of upper middle-class teens believe their parents would help them get out of a sticky situation at school.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has stood by his call to block all Muslims from entering the United States.
Trump defended his plan for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" by comparing it with President Franklin Roosevelt\'s actions during World War II.
The idea announced by Trump Monday evening drew swift rebukes, some from abroad.
Muslims in the United States and around the world denounced the idea as unconstitutional or offensive.
In morning TV interviews on ABC and CNN, Trump was asked about being compared with Hitler.
In the late 1800s, Congress passed legislation aimed at halting Chinese immigration.
"This is exactly what ISIS wants from Americans: to turn against each other."

To people in Europe, their own dysfunctions make sense; the European Union, after all, is made up of 28 nations with competing interests, while the eurozone, where the euro is the currency, is composed of 17 nations with differing economic needs and styles.
The writer suggested that given the current crisis "it is perhaps a good time for the befuddled world to start considering building a de-Americanized world."
A German newspaper columnist asked a question this week about the reaction to what was going on in Washington.
And Europe, troubled as it may be, remains a major economic force.
Earlier this year, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius gave a speech in Indonesia about recent global history and the end of "The American Century."
Joerg Wolf, editor in chief and a foreign policy expert at the Atlantic Community, a Berlin-based group, noted that "it is mind-boggling that politicians are so slow to see the costs of their actions."

A German newspaper columnist asked a question this week about the reaction to what was going on in Washington.
While it was only one column in one newspaper, it did nicely sum up how much of the world seemed to be seeing the United States during the budget fight:  both broken, like Greece, and bossy, like Germany.
The United States, after all, is not a bit player on the international stage like Greece.

"By then everyone was kind of running," Dececco said in an interview just moments after he and his daughter had scrambled up a rocky cliff for a better view.
In a state where tourism drives the economy, the rise in shark encounters has alarmed visitors and business owners alike.
Like many longtime residents and fishermen here, Alesna offers lots of theories for the rise in shark attacks.
Turtles, for example, are just one part of the broad diet favored by tiger sharks.
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140117_HAWAII_SHARKS.jpg" />MAKENA STATE PARK, Hawaii \u2014 There was a record number of shark attacks on people in the islands of Hawaii last year.
"By then everyone was kind of running," Dececco said in an interview just moments after he and his daughter had run up a rocky cliff for a better view.
For now, they see no need to change that policy.
There is no question, however, that many swimmers and snorkelers are adjusting their routines based on the attacks.

The beach then remains shut until noon the next day, until officials on helicopter and jet ski patrols believe that the shark has left the area.
For now, they see no need to change that policy.
Shark attacks increased in Hawaii in both 2013 and 2012.
In the three years before that there were just three incidents per year.
But, so far, the large number of recent attacks does not appear to have affected tourism.
State tourism officials think visitors to Hawaii realize that shark attacks are still very rare.
Sharks produce their babies during the winter months and attacks on humans are much more likely.
"People that come from the mainland have no respect for anything, neither the ocean nor the land," Alesna said about the visitors.
Like many longtime residents and fishermen here, Alesna has lots of theories for the rise in shark attacks.
She thinks that sharks might be coming closer to the beach to eat green sea turtles.
The turtle numbers have since recovered a bit in Hawaii.
These sharks are known as the "garbage cans" of the ocean because they will swallow anything they find.
"Tiger sharks \u2014 you don\'t play with them."
Two people died in 2013 \u2014 a German snorkeler and a kayak fisherman from Washington state.
Both attacks happened in the waters near Makena State Park.
In the three years before that there were just three attacks a year.
So he will now look at whether there are more tiger sharks where there are more fisherman, surfers and paddle boarders.

So he will now look at whether there are more tiger sharks where there are more people.
Later that same day, they watched a fisherman at the same spot at sunset.
It was an 8-foot-long tiger shark, one of the fiercest sharks around.
The tiger shark is probably responsible for most of the 14 attacks in Hawaii in 2013.
Eight of these happened near Makena.
The fisherman let go of his net and ran down the shore, shouting for swimmers to get out of the water.
Two people died in 2013 \u2014 a German snorkeler and a kayak fisherman from Washington state.

But many swimmers are changing what they do.
Some visitors said they will not swim very far out to sea because they are scared of the sharks.
People should also avoid cloudy water that attracts the sharks.
Alesna said that the tourists have no respect for the ocean.
Meyer says that turtles are just one of many things that tiger sharks eat.
But the scientist does know that there are more people in the ocean than ever before.

A Malaysian-born, British-educated accountant and former music executive, Fernandes teamed up with other investors to purchase a struggling Malaysian airline in 2001.
Last year, Branson dressed up as a female flight attendant and served customers on an AirAsia flight, after losing a bet to Fernandes over a Formula One car race.
"I always liked the idea of a low-cost airline, having gone to boarding school and wanted to go home more often, and the idea was always in my mind," he told reporters in 2011.

It will not be easy to stop pollution from China, said scientist Owen Cooper.
Now, people realize that smog in a faraway country can reach us here.
People used to think Chinese pollution would not reach us here, Faloona said.
They did not believe it could travel all the way across the Pacific.
The goal is to get a better idea of what happens to the human body during a prolonged mission.
"It\'s all about getting the astronaut there and back, healthy," said Basner, who is leading the Penn research alongside Ruben Gur and David Dinges.
Since the DNA of identical twins is very nearly the same, differences in their health may be attributed to different exposures \u2014 in this case, being in space versus on the ground.
But the results from these studies can be compared with those from astronauts on future long missions.
As a result, the Penn researchers developed harder questions in a variety of areas, such as working memory, spatial orientation and emotion recognition.
If the tests are validated in future studies, they might be used to determine whether an astronaut is alert enough to engage in a particularly challenging task, such as a space walk.
The Penn team says similar tests could be used for people in other high-stakes occupations, such as pilots.
The conditions in an airplane cockpit are quite different from those on the space station, but both are dangerous places to experience fatigue.
The 51-year-old Kelly twins have taken the cognitive tests several times here on Earth, and are scheduled to do so 11 times during the mission.
Yet their exposures and experiences make them different in any number of subtle ways, even though they grew up in the same household and pursued the same career.
But they will contribute to the Mars mission nonetheless, in the form of test results from their immune systems, their bacteria and their brains.

Basner thinks the tests might be able to help other people with risky jobs, like pilots.
Their test results will help keep the Mars astronauts safe and make sure their mission is a success.
Floating can also become a problem for astronauts.

Jeff King is leading the pack and attempting to hold off other drivers \u2014 called mushers \u2014 in the last stages of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
The finish line banner was set to be hung Monday morning on Front Street in Nome with help from the local electric company.
Zirkle, a 44-year-old musher from Two Rivers, Alaska, led hours before when she arrived at the Norton Bay village of Koyuk.
King departed Koyuk at 5:50 p.m. and arrived in Elim at 11:27 p.m. Zirkle got back on the trail at 5:51 p.m. and made it into Elim at 11:47 p.m., race officials said.
So, the city has been stockpiling snow, which was being trucked to Front Street for the final stretch to the finish line.
She attended the start of the race last year in Anchorage, fell in love with the event, and decided she needed to see the finish in person, too.
"Any dogs that can laugh when they run, with their tongues hanging out, they got my heart right now," said Cross, who just learned about the volunteer programs.
King rested his 12-dog team at the checkpoint for three hours and 42 minutes.
Snowfall has been light this winter in the frontier town of nearly 3,700, so the city has been stockpiling snow.
Each year teams of dogs on sleds and their drivers race across Alaska for nearly 1,000 miles.
"Yeah, I know, it\'s funny to see people dumping snow on a street instead of taking it off the street," said Greg Bill, an organizer of the Iditarod.
King, a four-time champion, was leading Aliy Zirkle by 20 minutes Sunday.
Zirkle, a 44-year-old musher from Two Rivers, Alaska, led hours before when she arrived at the village of Koyuk.

The 80-year-old South Carolina artist says he hopes the works help people understand their shared history, even for those outside the South.
Twiggs said he is enjoying his best year as an artist.
Gallery owner Sandy Rupp said Twiggs has been exploring flag images since the 1970s.
"He makes it his flag, and gives it his power."
In several, brown figures are in the background.
A black cow stands watch in some, recalling an animal Twiggs cared for as a poor child growing up in the South.
The pictures, he said, are also about something larger: "We are all targeted, we all have things to fear."
Many of his works show the Confederate flag \u2014 the flag of the South during the Civil War.
Others show faceless men with bulls-eyes on their backs.
The flags are colored red, white, or blue and are smudged with brown or blood-red spots.

Irene Granados turned 16 two years ago while walking through the desert, trying to reach the United States.
The cases involving Granados from El Salvador and the Giron brothers from Honduras are among the first to surface in South Florida.
When asked for details, Granados said gang members were threatening to steal her belongings as pressure for her to join.
She said her mother and other relatives told her the best thing to do was to flee to the United States, where she had an aunt living in Florida.
The officers arrested the teens and took them to a detention center near the border.
Many young people are leaving their homes in Central America and coming to the United States.
They traveled in a car with a guide and five other teens ages 13 to 16.

Several companies are trying to develop treatments to grow calorie-burning brown fat.
He called the work "an amazing study."
Being overweight is a serious problem.
Scientists can now start working on new ways to help lower obesity.
The gene was found in almost half of the Europeans tested.
But it was found in only a very small number of black people tested.
They weighed an average of 7 pounds more than those without two copies.
Later in the day, officials said that eight homes, an eight-unit apartment building and two commercial buildings were destroyed or damaged.
Instead, a fire erupted there and covered his neighborhood with smoke.
"It\'s like a scene from Armageddon," one homeowner said as thick, black smoke blotted out the sun.
On Wednesday, dangerous brush fires broke out in northern San Diego County.

Several schools and libraries were emptied out as well.
The protests were part of an ongoing campaign called "Fight for $15."
Janitors, nursing home workers and package delivery workers also joined some protests.
The "Fight for $15" campaign began about three years ago and is funded by the Service Employees International Union.
This time workers are pledging not to vote for presidential candidates that do not support the campaign.

Rodman is the most famous American to meet Kim since the leader inherited power after his father, Kim Jong Il, died in late 2011.
Other players also include Eric "Sleepy" Floyd, Doug Christie and Charles D. Smith, who played for the New York Knicks.
Four streetballers are also on the team.
"The marshal is actually trying to change this country in a great way," Rodman said of Kim.
Americans are seen as enemies in North Korea.
Thousands of U.S. troops are still based in South Korea, and the Demilitarized Zone between the North and South is one of the most armed borders in the world.
The country of North Korea is cut-off from most of the world and very few foreigners visit.

Instead, he sees the game as a "birthday present" for Kim and his country.
Rodman came back just before Christmas to hold tryouts for the North Korean basketball team.
To keep the game itself friendly, the two sides will only play against each other in the first half.
He is being held in North Korea on charges of committing "anti-state" crimes.
"The team is made up of a lot of guys who really care, that\'s the most important.

United Nations officials are pushing for a new way to define many of the Central Americans fleeing to the United States.
Nonetheless, the agency said it believes "the U.S. and Mexico should recognize that this is a refugee situation, which implies that they shouldn\'t be automatically sent to their home countries but rather receive international protection."
Most people widely considered to be refugees are fleeing more traditional political or ethnic conflicts like those in Syria or Sudan.
Central Americans would be among the first to be considered refugees because they are fleeing violence at the hands of criminal gangs.
Immigration experts say the flow of migrants from Honduras and El Salvador is likely to rise as the two countries experience more gang-related violence.
Such help could include emergency aid and social services for internally displaced people inside Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
They point to a failure to secure the border and recent immigration policy changes that led many to believe child migrants would be allowed to stay.
"Unaccompanied children and families who fear for their lives" must not be "forcibly returned" without an asylum hearing, U.N. official Leslie Velez declared.
The United Nations, an international organization that promotes peace and cooperation between countries, is pushing for a new way to define many of the Central Americans, particularly children, who have been coming into the United States.
In El Salvador, the end of a truce between street gangs has led to a steep rise in murders this year.
More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been caught since October.

United Nations chemical weapons inspectors arrived on Aug. 26 in one of the Syrian suburbs allegedly hit in a poison gas attack last week, after being delayed by a sniper attack.
They will resume their work on Aug. 27, and Ban vowed that "the safety and security of the investigation teams will be secured."
There was no word on whether anything that the inspectors learned Monday supported or contradicted opposition allegations that a poison-gas bombardment last week killed hundreds of civilians outside Damascus.

"They didn\'t even stop pounding nails," said Tracy Drury, an environmental engineer who studied the area with Miller soon after the 2006 slide.
But they were not there on Saturday when the mudslide wiped out their mobile home and swept away neighbors who are now missing and presumed dead.
The "toe" supports the millions of tons of dirt behind it, like someone with their back against a bulging door.
"I think we did the best that we could" given the reality "that nobody wanted to sell their property and move," Drury said.
Stevenson said county officials who approved the homes seemed more focused on whether they were in flood areas than on the risk of a landslide.
Instead of seeing homes being abandoned, he saw carpenters building new ones.
"That\'s kind of what happens around here."

They all tell the story of an unstable hillside that has defied efforts to prop it up.
Snohomish County Executive John Lovick and Public Works Director Steve Thomsen said Monday night they were not aware of the 1999 report.
According to a 1949 report, a main cause of the slides is the river slowly washing away the "toe" left behind by a previous slide.
"We always thought there was a possibility that a catastrophic event could come," said Pat Stevenson, the environmental manager of the Stillaguamish Tribe.

The swimming-pool-size shaft, 18 feet wide by 38 feet long, is yielding evidence from its depths of a cooler, wetter Pleistocene climate of 100,000 to 330,000 years ago.
Below that is "near shore" material from 100,000 to 330,000 years ago, Scott said.
In one spectacular instance back then, a worker scraped his bulldozer across what turned out to be a nearly intact skeleton of a Columbian mammoth with 10-foot-long tusks.
Scientists were thrilled with the find, given that previous discoveries in the tar pits had included only bits and pieces of mammoths.
They then wrapped the deposits in heavy plastic, built wooden crates around them and lifted them out with a heavy crane.
Above the fresh muck, wood and concrete had been installed to hold back the soil.

A major shift in immigration patterns is set to take place over the next 50 years in the U.S., according to a new study.
Today, immigrants make up 14 percent of the U.S. population, an increase from 5 percent in 1965.
White immigrants to America, 80 percent back in 1965, will hover somewhere between 18 and 20 percent.
"There are relatively fewer people who would choose to migrate from Mexico, so demographic changes in Mexico have led to a somewhat smaller pool of potential migrants," he said.
Of those, 12 percent were positive, 11 percent negative and 26 percent were neutral, according to the report.

"It\'s not something the (regular person) understands, but they should," Jackson said.
He called the auction the best way to preserve the rhino.
Nearly 1,800 of the rhinos are in Namibia located in southwestern Africa, said the safari club.
Killing an older, bad-tempered rhino means that more rhino calves will be born, he said.

Under the new rules, if someone is caught trying to sell ivory items, the government will seize them unless sellers can provide proof that they are legal.
Sales within states will also be stopped unless sellers can show they were brought into the U.S. before the ban.
Late last year, U.S. officials destroyed more than six tons of seized ivory tusks, carvings and jewelry.
There the market price for ivory is more than $1,000 a pound and has increased significantly, according to the World Wildlife Fund.
While unveiling the plans, the Obama administration called on Congress to pass more laws to crack down on the trafficking.

That means someone who placed an ivory chess set for sale on eBay, for example, faced little risk of being investigated by police.
Ashe said that the legal trade provides a "smoke screen" for the unlawful ivory sales.
He said it also makes it more difficult for police to find the banned goods, as well as catch and punish the criminals.
Last week, France followed suit by crushing more than three tons of ivory.
Other nations including Gabon and China have taken similar steps.
The price of ivory has increased significantly, according to the World Wildlife Fund.
Instead, it will target the organized criminals that profit from the unlawful trade.

That chimpanzee \u2014 the "ringleader," Wisthoff called him \u2014 persuaded six friends to join him up there.
The breakout happened at about 3:30 p.m., and it took an hour for zookeepers to herd the animals, in groups of two or three, back into their area.
The chimps were lured with fruit and greens such as carrots, celery and lettuce, their usual food.
So for that last reluctant animal, zookeepers brought out a bag of malted milk balls.
That made him wonder whether the branch or log used Thursday had been broken off recently.
Those who remained stayed put during the lockdown.

Daniels went to the Turkey-Syria border earlier this summer to train 20 Syrians who want to protect the historic sites.
The Syrians were taught how to protect museum collections during emergencies and were given supplies to secure pottery and library books.
Both the rebels and the Assad government  are responsible for an "incredible amount" of destruction, Daniels said.
These cities, buildings or national parks have important cultural or natural value.
The authors of the report hope it will help the U.S. government and humanitarian groups better protect historical sites in war zones.

The government believes that more than 1 million people in the country die from smoking-related diseases each year.
There are many reasons not to smoke cigarettes.
Beijing began trying to limit smoking in 2008.
Back then, there were fines for businesses that did not follow the rules.
But fines for people who smoked in non-smoking areas were only about $1.40.
Naming smokers online may not sound like a big deal.
Shaming is one of the many ways the government pushes people to follow its rules.

At the request of several Native American tribes, an ancient human skeleton will soon be reburied in a formal ceremony.
However, a competing proposal held that they were actually descended from people who had migrated from southwestern Europe.
The new research argued strongly against that idea, scientists said.
The study does not support the idea that the first Americans originated from Europe, as proposed by the Solutrean hypothesis," said study co-author Michael Waters.
"These genetic findings" support the idea that "the American continent was first explored and settled around 15,000 years ago, with Clovis emerging 2,000 years later."
"They showed a lot of interest in the study, but all of them said that now is the time for the skeleton to go back into the ground," Willerslev said.
The Clovis culture is so named because its first remnants were found in 1932 in Clovis, N.M. To archaeologists, the culture is known by the distinctive stone spear points it left behind.
"That we\'ve been here since time immemorial, and that all the artifacts, objects in the ground are remnants of our direct ancestors."
Sometime soon, pieces of a very important skeleton will be reburied.
The difference in age, Waters said, suggests the antler tools were kept for generations.

Veteran farmer Mark Flamm has declared war on birds.
"That didn\'t work," said Flamm, who once lost a fifth of his berries to his feathered foes, "though I got a picture of a bird sitting on the scarecrow."
Suddenly all the other birds go quiet because they know they could be eaten," said Flamm, whose crop loss from birds has dwindled down to around 3 percent.

If you wonder how fattening that supersized soft drink is, in about a year you will find out.
Included in the new rules are large chain restaurants, amusement parks and movie theaters.
Even supermarkets and convenience stores that serve prepared dishes must say how many calories they contain.
The additional information would include things like salt, sugar, fat and cholesterol content.
The new guidelines were required under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which expanded health care coverage in the United States.
The new rules were detailed on Tuesday in the Federal Register, which publishes government documents.
Americans spend nearly half their food money on food made outside the home.
Two-thirds of adults and one-third of children are either overweight or obese.
"Consumers will have the information they need to make healthier, more educated decisions about their food choices when eating outside the home," he said.
In the years since, state and local governments created their own labeling requirements.
The new FDA rules will help avoid situations in which a chain restaurant has to meet different labeling requirements in different states, the FDA wrote.
Larkin wrote the association is "disappointed" that the FDA\'s rules include grocery stories.
Next year, people will be able to learn how fattening that supersized soft drink is.
The new rules take effect Dec. 1, 2015.
In 1990, the federal Nutrition Labeling and Education Act required that calorie counts be listed on most foods.

The sardine fishing boat Eileen moved slowly through moonlit waters from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island off the California coast.
To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish rare on the West Coast.
One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast.
He is the California program director for the conservation group Oceana, which contends that continuing to fish for them could speed their decline and arrest any recovery.
By the 1950s sardines had practically vanished, and in the 1960s California established a temporary ban on sardine fishing that lasted 18 years.
The following year, their pups showed up on the coast in overwhelming numbers, stranded and underweight.
They have shown signs of starving and have largely failed to breed or rear chicks there since 2010.

It was for children who were identified by their teachers and parents to be at high risk for developing aggressive, or violent, behavioral problems.
The students were put into two groups.
It reduced delinquency, arrests and use of health and mental health services as the students aged through the teenage and young adult years, as researchers explained in a separate study published earlier this year.
The researchers found that about a third of the effect on future crime outcomes was due to the social and self-regulation skills the students learned from ages 6 to 11.
The academic skills that were taught as part of Fast Track turned out to have less of an effect on crime and delinquency rates than did the soft skills.
Soft skills might include teaching kids to work cooperatively in a group or teaching them how to think about the long-term results when they make a decision.
Teaching math is an example of a hard skill.
"The conclusion that we would make is that these (soft) skills should be emphasized even more in our education system and in our system of socializing children," says Kenneth Dodge.
Dodge was a principal investigator in this study as well as in the original Fast Track project.
"To the extent we can improve those skills, we can improve outcomes in delinquency and (youth) crime," says Dodge.
Bernstein is also the author of many books, including "How to Keep Your Teenager Out of Trouble and What to Do if You Can\'t."
"There\'s a growing and new understanding of what it takes to be successful as a (teenager) and an adult," Dodge says.

Lakes and rivers have been drying up, reservoirs are at all-time lows and there have been water supply cuts in some areas.
Iran regularly ranks near the bottom in global surveys of how nations manage water supplies, officials say.
He and others have launched a campaign to raise awareness.
A prayer campaign, officials felt, could be an effective tool to get out the message that Iran is running dry.
Religious leaders were also asked to urge people to reduce their water usage, said the letter, which was released in the local press.
Most Iranians use tap water for both drinking and washing.
The water problem is not likely to go away any time soon.
"In the short term there is really no solution," professor B. Alijani said in an interview.
He and others have started a campaign to raise awareness.
At Friday prayers across Iran, the faithful prayed for rain, or at least were told to do so.
"We only shower two times a week," he said.
The water problem is not going away anytime soon.
"For God\'s sake, let\'s go to God\'s door and ask his Almighty to send water," an excited Ayatollah Kazem Sedighi begged the crowd gathered at Tehran University.
The ayatollah, or Muslim religious leader, broke into sobs from time to time as he begged the crowd to make their pleas both to God and to Imam Hussein.
Concerns are growing about the lack of water across Iran.
"In the short term there is really no solution," professor B. Alijani said in an interview.
Now, the lake is drying up as its shores shrink every year.
Ideas to improve farming methods and change what many regard as wasteful personal use of water are also being considered.
Mohammad Hadi Heidarzadeh, the top official in charge of the environment in Tehran, wrote a letter to a Muslim religious council in charge of Friday prayers.
The letter, which was provided to the local press, asked the leaders to encourage people to use less water.
At Friday prayers across Iran, the faithful prayed for rain, or at least were told to do so.
"For God\'s sake, let\'s go to God\'s door and ask his Almighty to send water," said an excited Ayatollah Kazem Sedighi.
However, Alijani said that Iranians need to learn how to bring down their water use "and avoid wasting it both at home and in the fields."
The Middle Eastern country of Iran is struggling with a shortage of water.
"For God\'s sake, let\'s go to God\'s door and ask his Almighty to send water," Ayatollah Kazem Sedighi said.
"For God\'s sake, let\'s go to God\'s door and ask his Almighty to send water," said an excited Ayatollah Kazem Sedighi.
Most Iranians use water from the sink for both drinking and washing.
Officials felt that a prayer campaign could be a valuable tool to get out the message that Iran is running dry.
They have asked religious leaders to invite the faithful to join them in a "rain prayer."
The leaders were told to ask people to use less water.
"For God\'s sake, let\'s go to God\'s door and ask his Almighty to send water," Ayatollah Kazem Sedighi said.
The leaders were also told to ask people to use less water.
"For God\'s sake, let\'s go to God\'s door and ask his Almighty to send water," Ayatollah Kazem Sedighi said.
The lack of water could be a sign, the ayatollah said.
Sadly, it has not rained in months.
"On some days of the week, our tap water is cut for seven or eight hours," he said.
There are big plans for recycling waste water.
"It would be a long shot for a female to wander this far," said Matt Peek, a biologist at the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks.
Missouri has had more than 50 confirmed sightings since 1994, according to the Missouri Department of Conservation.
"They\'re more likely to come across Nebraska from west to east following the river, which leads them to Missouri," Peek said.
"Still, livestock is hugely important in the Midwest."
Nielsen said females typically move less often than males.

For now, there have not been any mountain lion attacks in Kansas or Missouri.
Sophia Pellar used to have pain in her ears when she played flute in her high school pep band.
"But the thought of wearing them every day is a little embarrassing," she said.
Research indicates that as many as 1 in 5 teens suffers from hearing loss.
The music educators now being trained at colleges and universities are learning that they should teach the importance of students protecting their hearing during rehearsals and performances.
Still, officials say that even the most cautious parents typically are unaware of the need for their children to take steps to be safe.
"We\'re seeing a rise in the number of adolescents with hearing loss, which is not a surprise when you look at our society, which has gotten busier, nosier and overstimulated," said Dr. Henry Ou, a professor of ear, nose and throat medicine at Seattle Children\'s Hospital.
The National Association for Music Education urges teachers and band directors to address the dangers of hearing loss caused by noise.
He even keeps a large jar in the band room stocked with foam earplugs for his students.
Officials there said the reluctance of some teens and adults to be seen wearing earplugs helped inspire its newly designed earplugs that are smaller and less obvious.
"The kids know I\'m not the least bit shy about it.
Sophia Pellar plays the flute in her New Trier High School pep band.
"I had never thought of it at all ... and she has been playing the flute since she was in fourth grade," said Pellar, a doctor.
They suggest, for example, making sure that students are not performing at high volume levels for a long time.
They need to do this both during practice and performances and outside of the band program, too, Karon said.
High school music teachers are trying to get students to do something to protect their ears.
The earplugs are made to protect musicians from hearing loss.
"I had never thought of it at all ... and she has been playing the flute since she was in fourth grade," her mother said.
"I also have concerns when I walk by my kids when they have their earbuds in and I can still hear their music."
Sophia Pellar plays the flute in her New Trier High School pep band.
Still, Sophia giggles nervously when she explains that the earplugs have yet to become part of her regular routine.
Yet experts say their messages are not working as well as they can.
She became alarmed recently when she learned that Sophia is often in pain after playing her flute in tight space with her fellow musicians.
The result is hearing damage that builds up over time.
"Sound is just energy," Ou said, and when it is too loud, sound "can cause damage."
"I had never thought of it at all ... and she has been playing the flute since she was in fourth grade," her mother said.
Doctors who study teen hearing loss say loud music can harm the hair cells inside the ear.
The National Association for Music Education has a message for teachers and band leaders.
They made them because some people did not want to be seen wearing earplugs.
He has led a series of studies identifying overhunting as the major reason for the steep decline in lion populations in Tanzania, the biggest lion-hunting country in Africa.
At the root of the problem, he believes, is the preference of trophy hunters for large male lions.
In Tanzania, Packer said, the big, older trophy males became so few that hunters started killing immature maneless lions.
It\'s a very efficient way to promote the social instability that will cause a population to decline," he said.
"In instances where you have widespread corruption and regulations are not adhered to, it just becomes a killing frenzy and that\'s what\'s happening in Zimbabwe."
In Kenya, where hunting was banned in 1977, the lion population has dropped from 15,000 to about 2,000 in 15 years.
Critics argue that trophy hunting brings little economic benefit to local communities.
"Across Africa, local communities receive minimal benefit from trophy hunting," the report said.
The male lions might also kill off some cubs and attack females who defend them.
A 2013 study by the Australian group Economists at Large found that only 3 percent of the money spent by trophy hunters winds up in the hands of local people.
In July, a Zimbabwean lion called Cecil was killed by an American, sparking anger around the globe.
Yet some research suggests a different theory: Hunting has hidden consequences that have a far greater effect on lion populations than people realize.
At the root of the problem, he believes, is that trophy hunters prefer large male lions.
From 2002 to 2009, 1,363 dead lions were exported from Tanzania.
Yet the lion population has dropped from 15,000 to about 2,000 in 15 years.
Nearly 70 percent are bred in cages, and are often used as cubs in petting zoos.

In a grim game of "choose your poison," Floridians debate with their tornado-weary friends and family about which disaster they\'d rather have.
And yet studies have found \u2014 even with the start of hurricane season looming June 1 \u2014 that as many as two in three Florida residents say they have no plan for what they will do if a tropical storm threatens.
Preparation helped only a little for Moore, Oklahoma, last Monday.
It was tracked on the ground for 50 minutes \u2014 an eternity for a tornado \u2014 and its damage zone was more than 17 miles wide.
But only one in four tornadoes have wind speeds at 110 miles per hour or greater, the threshold of a major hurricane.
Damage at 111 miles per hour is 21 times what it would be at 75 mph, a minimum-strength hurricane, according to a chart prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
While tornadoes can do vast damage in a short time, hurricanes have an arsenal of ways to damage lives and property.
Andrew, one of only three Category 5 storms to strike the U.S. mainland, had top sustained winds of 165 miles per hour.
That was more time than most past twisters have allowed.
In a grim game of "choose your poison," Floridians debate with their friends and family about which disaster they\'d rather have.
But "they\'re the one threat we can see coming," said Craig Fugate, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
And yet studies have found that as many as two in three Florida residents say they have no plan for what they would do if a tropical storm threatens.
Preparation helped only a little in Moore, Oklahoma, last Monday.
It can flood buildings and drown people miles inland.
"In Florida, the homes are built to be wind resistant, and in the Midwest, less so," said Remington Brown, an engineer for the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety.
In a game of "choose your poison," Floridians debate which disaster they\'d rather have.
Hurricanes have many cons: powerful winds, vicious storm surges and damage over a wider area.
That advantage makes it wrong to not prepare, Fugate told the National Hurricane Conference in New Orleans in March.
It was tracked on the ground for 50 minutes and its damage zone was more than 17 miles wide.
But only one in four tornadoes have wind speeds at 110 mph or greater.
And they can plow across thousands of miles for days before dying.
Even minor problems such as power outages often cover a vastly larger area.
Damage at 111 mph is 21 times what it would be at 75 mph, a minimum-strength hurricane.
But the storm pounded that area for two days, and did as much damage as a stronger, shorter storm.
A slow-moving hurricane can produce much more rainfall than a swifter, stronger one.
Small storms can produce tornadoes as often as large ones.
And that was more time than most past twisters allowed.
As many as 500,000 people felt those winds.

A tornado of EF2 or more \u2014 winds of 111 to 165 miles per hour \u2014 can destroy a structure in four seconds.
Emergency responders must then face a sea of people who want immediate help.
This is according to a chart by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
At 155 mph, the damage is multiplied by 333.
Yet, those in the Midwest might be built for 90 mph, Brown said.
And that was more time than most past twisters allowed.
Damage at 111 miles per hour is 21 times that of a 75 mph minimum-strength hurricane.
Only a tiny corner of Palm Beach County experienced such gusts.
Yet, Midwest buildings might be built for 90 mph, Brown said.
Hurricanes can be hundreds of miles wide.
And they can plow across thousands of miles for days.
Bill Johnson is an emergency expert in Palm Beach County.
But, there can be very different effects from those winds.
Damage at 111 miles per hour is 21 times that of a 75 mph minimum-strength hurricane.
Buildings in Florida can hold winds of up to 140 miles per hour.
In order to introduce the caves to a wider international audience, the Getty Museum in Los Angeles will host a major exhibition on the complex starting in May 2016.
Its efforts in China represent "some of the best work we\'ve ever done in the field," said Tim Whalen, director of the Getty Conservation Institute.
"These are questions facing World Heritage Sites everywhere \u2014 how do you preserve them and still ensure access for the public and scholars?"
"But there are not a lot of organizations investing in research that finds answers to these questions."
According to the research by Getty and the Dunhuang Academy, the site could only handle 3,000 tourists a day \u2014 a number that seemed unrealistically low given the growing interest in the grottoes.
The Getty\'s work in China is "some of the best work we\'ve ever done in the field," said Tim Whalen, director of the Getty Conservation Institute.
The grottoes, or small caves, received 26,000 visitors in 1979, the first year they were open to the public.
Its futuristic shape resembles the sand dunes of the surrounding landscape.
To introduce the caves to a wider international audience, the Getty Museum in Los Angeles will a host a major exhibition about the grottoes in May 2016.
Since then its researchers have worked on many high-profile World Heritage Sites, including the Tomb of Queen Nefertari and the Great Sphinx in Egypt.
A World Heritage Site is a place that is listed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as having cultural or natural importance.
The Getty\'s work in China is "some of the best work we\'ve ever done in the field," said Tim Whalen, director of the Getty Conservation Institute.
The first step is to survey the caves, to examine them carefully and understand the materials used to make the paintings.
At Mogao, the Getty team developed a detailed plan to conserve the caves and monitor the conditions there.
The plan has been tried over the last decade at Cave No.
The caves also contain many religious sculptures, including a 1,300-year-old Buddha dressed in orange robes that is more than 100 feet high and nearly 40 feet wide.
Getty experts worked with the Chinese and Australian governments to write the China Principles \u2014 national guidelines for conserving and managing important historic sites.
China has many historic sites, but managing them was not consistent.
The China Principles filled a key gap.
The new visitor center shows two films lasting 20 minutes each.
Today the caves are facing a new danger: tourists.
According to Tim Whalen, director of the Getty Institute, the work in China is "some of the best work we\'ve ever done in the field."
The caves here are very old.
Russian soldiers even lived in the caves during a war in the 1920s.

"The question really becomes: Los Angeles is the second-largest market in the country and can the NFL afford to continue to use it" as a threat, said Bob Graziano.
Three years later, in 2005, the Colts started building the Lucas Oil Stadium in downtown Indianapolis.
The league brings in more than $9 billion each year.
"The entire gang involved in the murder attempt ... has been busted," Bajwa said, adding that the "terrorists" were part of Tehrik-e-Taliban, a larger group made up of several violent terror organizations from across the tribal areas.
Both Pakistan and Afghanistan have long accused each other of ignoring fighters who launch cross-border attacks from their territory.
He did not say when or where the men were captured, but said security agencies captured all 10 in a coordinated operation acting on information from one of the members of the group.

It is a good time to be in the toy business.
In fact, "Frozen" was the top toy brand last year according to NPD, reaching $531 million in sales.
Hasbro, the nation\'s second-largest toy company, reported a jump in sales this year, helped by toys related to "Star Wars."
It shoots balls 100 feet per second.
Robotic toys are becoming more life-like and now include voice recognition features.
"But I don\'t know how long I would play with this until I got bored."
Sales in October, November and December are expected to reach $9.6 million, a 5 percent increase.

Nearly three months after nearby residents looted and burned the Archangel Michael Christian church, Rida Gaballah, 49, stood among the ruins.
"Of course they are doing enough," Gaballah said when asked about the government\'s efforts, even as the scene around him proved otherwise, just 16 miles from the capital Cairo.
But now, for both Christians and Muslim Egyptians alike, that anger has been replaced by a complete silence, even though attacks continue.
There has been, at best, a single arrest in the most recent church burnings.
"They see it as better to live under a strong regime than a democracy that elects Islamists," said Ishak Ibrahim, a Christian who is the freedom of religion and belief officer for a civil rights group in Egypt.
"The choice before people is freedom or the right to live," Ibrahim said.
Three months ago, the Archangel Michael Christian church was looted and burned by hundreds of people.
Utterly dismayed by the missing pews, the charred paintings of Jesus and the cross ripped off from the front door, he simply kept repeating: "This scene is horrible."
But Gaballah, like other Christians, is slow to criticize.

The wave of attacks on churches sparked outrage in the weeks immediately after Morsi was forced out of office.
But they have never had an easy time in the country, often caught between a strictly non-religious government and sometimes hostile Islamists who want to return to a strictly Muslim state.
They included that Muslims had to approve construction of a church, and churches could not face the Nile River.
Egyptian governments have also done little to protect Christians from the occasional violence by Muslims.
But Christians in Egypt now think that a military government is better for them than a democracy dominated by Islamists.
Egyptian Christians fear that pushing back against the government could lead to something they believe is worse, the return of the Islamists.
A police colonel said there will be no special efforts to go after those who destroyed the churches.
The officers first want to find out who destroyed their police stations and lock up members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood.
"Our job is not to protect churches," the colonel said, speaking in secret.
Other people believe the police have their own reasons for the lack of protection.
He said that when churches are burned, the government can blame the Muslim Brotherhood and win support for their crackdown on the Islamists.

Once shot on sight, trapped and poisoned as vermin, wolverines were gone form Washington by the 1930s.
Wolverines used to range along the Cascade Crest from the Canadian border all the way to Mount Rainier, but now remain exceedingly rare, with perhaps just 25 living in Washington, and only about 250 to 300 in the lower 48 states.
Genetic testing shows the animals they are finding can be traced to populations in Canada that recolonized here once the trapping stopped.
Now, those animals, once just visitors, have established resident populations \u2013 and they are spreading.
It\'s the success, the reward," said Jen Watkins, of Conservation Northwest, as she dunked pine-branch tips into a bottle of foul-smelling scent lure.
Over the next 100 years, [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) is expected to melt 63 percent of the landscapes where deep snow that wolverines need to survive persists into May.
Fish and Wildlife Service on Friday proposed listing wolverines for protection as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in at least six Western states.
Their long, thick, brown-and-gold coats shed frost and are underlaid with a soft insulating layer of fur that defeats the most brutal cold.
"They are the superheroes of the animal world," said Shawn Sartorius, a wildlife biologist for the Fish and Wildlife Service.
For now, ensuring wolverine survival is about preserving and providing safe access to the strongholds the wolverines are returning to, Watkins said.

Now inventors are moving beyond the production of solid, static objects to create materials that can be transformed and manipulated at will.
"The project was originally about camouflage," says lead author Mark Guttag, a Ph.D. student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
When the material is compressed, its naturally smooth surface takes on a patterned texture that varies depending on the spacing and shapes of the rigid polymers.
It can be smooth, ridged or bumpy, or it can even form more complicated patterns.
Once the material is printed, its rigid polymers are stuck in a fixed order and cannot change positions relative to one another.
"The main thing is the relative sizing of particles and relative spacing of them, as opposed to the absolute size," Guttag said.

3-D printers used to make only hard objects, like car parts.
It can be used to print soft objects.
This can make the soft polymer become smooth, bumpy or rough.
When the two polymers are no longer squeezed, the material returns to its smooth surface.
It can even make some objects waterproof.
This new type of 3-D printing could help many businesses.
Electric eels can use their zapping power in subtle and surprising ways.
A new study finds that when dealing with struggling or hard-to-subdue prey, these eels bend their bodies into a horseshoe-like shape.
The findings, published in the journal Current Biology, shed new light on the abilities of these remarkable hunters.
During his research, Catania started to notice something odd: Many of the eels would curl up their bodies when zapping a meal, bringing their head toward their tail with the fish in between.
So it seemed that by curling their bodies, the eels might be bringing the opposing ends of that organ closer together to concentrate the stunning power.
The findings are part of a growing body of research showing that eels do not use their electric powers as a blunt tool.
A new study finds that when dealing with large or struggling prey, these eels bend their bodies into a horseshoe-like shape.
Once the eels shock their prey, they reposition it in the water so they can swallow it head-first.
In that brief moment, the fish has its only chance to swim off and avoid becoming an eel meal.

A new study finds that when dealing with large or struggling prey, these eels bend their bodies into a horseshoe-like shape.
"Even an animal that\'s been studied for centuries may be doing amazing things that we were unaware of," said Catania.
Earlier, he discovered they can "remote control" their prey: The animals send out a jolt of electricity that forces hidden fish to twitch and thus reveal their location.
The only time they did was when they were trying to subdue particularly difficult prey, such as a large crayfish.
In effect the animal was paralyzed temporarily, making it safe for the eel to release and reposition it.
Catania still wants to explore one basic and perplexing question: How does the eel avoid shocking itself?

Early in 2014, federal officials and immigrant rights activists noticed a disturbing trend at the U.S. border with Mexico.
Now that the flow of immigrants has eased, how are the children doing?
"I believe a large number, 50 percent, have been able to show up in immigration court and have been allowed to stay, avoiding deportation," said Nora Sandigo.
"Immigration authorities keep requiring me to report my whereabouts, and that affects my ability to get a stable job," said Cindy Figueroa Castro.
For Jose Cruz, a Cuban-American and former Jesuit priest who helped resettle young Cubans in the 1960s, the Central American minors are facing a crisis.
Thus far, the White House has not responded, aid Cruz.
"It\'s because they are thousands of miles away from their families and native lands, having been abruptly separated because of unspeakable violence in their home countries."
The news shocked the nation as arrivals reached record levels.
Depending on who you talk to, some of the children are doing relatively well while others are dealing with various issues.
Sandigo said the main issues are a lack of lawyers to represent the children in court and not enough resources for public schools.
Cheryl Little, who helps lead Americans for Immigrant Justice, said the children face special challenges.
Early in 2014, officials noticed something unusual at the U.S. border with Mexico.
Tens of thousands of children were crossing illegally, without their parents.
Overall, Schuster said, the children might be facing problems \u2014 but not in the schools.
She is a Honduran mother of a 4-year-old child who crossed the border last year.
Thus far, the White House has not responded, Cruz said.
John Schuster of the Miami-Dade County public schools said the Central American children have been welcomed in the local schools.

And we have seen some good signs that the [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) \u2014 staghorn coral \u2014 continues to be abundant and may even be increasing in abundance in some places," said Richard Dodge, executive director of the National Coral Reef Institute.
Greater public awareness has prompted boaters to avoid dropping anchors on the fragile reef.
And a decision to move ship anchorages farther offshore from Port Everglades prevented damaging ship groundings.
These are designed to filter out pollutants rather than channel fertilizer-laden water out to sea.
"People are aware they need to take better care of our coral reefs to help get them through what no doubt will be a stressful time, as the climate continues to change," said conservationist Chris Bergh.
"There are a lot of big and expensive things that still need to be done, and I guess the most expensive of all is getting a handle on the root causes of climate change."
To help restore damaged reefs, scientists at the Reef Institute are growing baby corals in indoor nurseries.
"There\'s no doubt that if we destroy those beautiful reefs, there will be some significant economic impact," said Abraham Pizam, director of the Institute for Tourism Studies.
"It\'s an important element that should be preserved for generations to come."
A study released this month brought more good news: Coral reefs may be able to adapt to warmer sea temperatures.

But we are lucky in South Florida to avoid a lot of hurricanes and tropical storms lately."
Studies in 2000 and 2004 found that reefs along the southeast Florida coast generated $6 billion of economic activity.
We still worry about bleaching, which appears to be caused by warmer water temperatures," Dodge said.

The fumes they are exposed to mainly come from cigarettes smoked by men.
According to the most recent national survey, 288 million men smoked regularly in China in 2010, compared with just 13 million women.
Now the women are striking back.
"This is a very important step," said Yang Gonghuan, a doctor who has been documenting tobacco\'s toll on Chinese health since the 1980s.
For example, ex-NBA player Yao Ming has lent his name to the cause.
At the same time, male Chinese leaders such as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping smoked openly in public.
Smoking has remained common in public places across the country, particularly in the countryside, where half of the population lives.
It was not until 2010 that the Health Ministry banned smoking in its own building.
Individual cities have made their own restrictions on tobacco.
Xu Guihua, of the Chinese Association on Tobacco Control, said enforcement of the rules would be very important, and would require a big shift in Chinese attitudes.
Many women in China work in offices filled with clouds of cigarette smoke.
"It is very difficult to push for these kinds of changes," she said.
Smoking has remained common in public places across the country, particularly in the countryside, where half the population lives.
Even so, Xu is hopeful that change will come.
Smoking is so common in China that the country is known as the Smoking Dragon.
"This is a very important step," said Yang Gonghuan, a doctor who has been studying the dangers of tobacco since the 1980s.
Smoking has remained common in public places across the country, particularly in the countryside, where half the population lives.
However, women smoke far less than men do.
Women have been very important in trying to control smoking.
The Chinese government came up with a tough new set of rules on smoking.
China is known for its smog caused by factories and cars.
Each year, around 1 million Chinese die from diseases caused by smoking.
Things changed after most Chinese switched from pipes to cigarettes in the early 1900s.
These days, Peng is well known for speaking out against smoking.
Mexican archaeologists say that the new rooms contained thousands of objects, including carved statues, rubber balls, jade from Guatemala and a wooden box of shells.
The tunnel, discovered 11 years ago under the Temple of the Feathered Serpent at the heart of the ancient city, is the latest piece in a puzzle dating back to before Europeans arrived in the New World.
It will probably take years of analysis to truly understand the significance of each object and why they were placed together, he added.
He and his team announced Wednesday that three more chambers lay beyond the initial two, arranged in a sort of cross just a few dozen feet down the tunnel.
He believes that "there is a burial site but we won\'t know for sure until next year."
It will probably take years of study to truly understand the significance of each object and the reasons they were placed together, he added.
The discovery of a royal burial under the Temple of the Feathered Serpent might change everything known about the city.
They include a wooden box filled with shells imported from the ocean and carved by stone tools.
In addition, there were four 2-foot-tall jade statues, rubber balls and jaguar remains.

On Wednesday, Mexican scientists announced a major discovery.
It will probably take years of study to truly understand the significance of each object, he added.
However, "we won\'t know for sure until next year."
"Just before the chambers is where we found very important offerings," says Sergio Gomez, who directs the excavation project.
Such offerings would likely have been made to honor a dead person of great importance.
"These findings are very important," commented Professor George Cowgill, who directs a research center at Teotihuacan.
It will probably take years of study to truly understand the significance of each object and the reasons they were placed together, he added.
A high point came in 2013 with the discovery of two chambers on either side of the tunnel, which were filled with mirrors and strange crystal spheres.
He said it is possible there are buried nobles hidden under rubble or even below the chamber floors.
He believes that there is a burial site "but we won\'t know for sure until next year."
On Wednesday, Mexican scientists announced a major discovery.
Cowgill added that some other objects in the chambers show that trade was being carried out with distant peoples.

Now scientists at Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology have figured out a way to use ocean waves to recreate the ground motion that occurs in real earthquakes.
The new technique is being used to better understand the effect of shaking on cities that have not had a large earthquake in recent years, said Marine Denolle.
Scientists are not trying to predict when an earthquake will happen.
But those waves are billions of times weaker than the seismic waves produced by earthquakes.
The waves acted as substitutes for seismic waves created by earthquakes.
They showed that seismic waves from the southern San Andreas Fault will become bigger when they reach the soft earth beneath Los Angeles.
The tub represents the solid rocks around it.
He is a professor at Stanford and co-wrote the study.
The research group plans to test this new method in other parts of Southern California and in other cities around the world, he said.
It was developed as a way to test computer models of Southern California earthquakes, Beroza said.
"Sometime in the future we\'ll have a big earthquake in Southern California, and these sorts of studies can help us anticipate the reach of these earthquakes."
"It\'s virtually certain that we will have a damaging earthquake in the future."
Ocean waves often get in the way when scientists are studying earthquakes.
Denolle said the effect can be compared to shaking a bathtub with water in it.
He and Denolle plan to test the waves in other parts of Southern California and in other cities around the world, he said.
The virtual earthquake technique was developed as a way to test computer models of Southern California earthquakes, Beroza said.
Scientists who study earthquakes look for waves of energy.
The virtual earthquake technique was made to test computer models of Southern California earthquakes, Beroza said.
These are waves of energy that move through the Earth.
It is being used to better understand the effect of shaking on cities that have not had a large earthquake in several years, said Marine Denolle.
For the Science study, Denolle installed seismometers along the San Andreas Fault.
The waves acted as substitutes for seismic waves caused by earthquakes.
Donelle was a student at Stanford during the study.
She is now continuing her work at the University of California.
Other cities rest on top of sedimentary basins, too.
He and Denolle plan to test the waves in other parts of Southern California and in other cities around the world, he said.
He works for a government program that keeps track of  the dangers from earthquakes.
It is attractive in that it uses real seismic waves and "gives us some confidence that we\'re on the right track with the computer models," he said.
It is being used to understand the effect of shaking on cities that have not had a large earthquake in a long time, said Marine Denolle.
They showed that seismic waves from the San Andreas Fault will become bigger when they reach the soft earth beneath Los Angeles.
In this case, the water is like the soft ground.
The tub is like the solid rocks around it.
This can help people and governments to prepare for them, he said.
They use the waves to show how the ground moves in real earthquakes.
The reason is the city sits on top of a soft piece of land.
It is known as the "virtual earthquake technique."

Scientists have found fossil-like hints that some kind of life existed on Earth 4.1 billion years ago, shortly after the Earth was formed.
Think of it as "the gooey remains" of life, said study co-author Mark Harrison, a UCLA geochemistry professor.
"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth," Hedges said, "then it could be common in the universe."
Scientists have found something that changes how they think about life on Earth.
There are different types of carbon.

Los Angeles, California residents are dealing with a foreign breed of troublesome mosquitoes.
However, if two mosquitoes that both have Wolbachia mate, then their eggs will hatch as normal, although the offspring will potentially carry Wolbachia.
Wiping out one species of mosquito also means that others could potentially fill that gap.
In an area like Los Angeles County where there were not any mosquitoes that carry dengue or chikungunya until recently, Dobson says it makes sense to try to target this disease-carrying population, and not worry about competing mosquitoes.
"We can\'t control mosquitoes with a single approach, and this is a new way with great potential," says Stephen Higgs, a Kansas State University disease expert.
People in the city of\xa0Los Angeles\xa0are finding a new kind of mosquito in their yards.
Both cause severe pain in the joints and muscles, and fever.
The test bugs will all be male, and will not bite humans as female mosquitoes do.
Residents were told the method should help reduce both pesticide use and their mosquito population.
They are infected with Wolbachia, a natural bacteria that sterilizes them.
Dobson believes that since the Asian Tiger mosquitoes are still new to California, they can be controlled.
His hope is to establish the bacteria among mosquitoes in the wild so that they will not be able to pass on disease with their bite.
Wiping out one species of mosquito also means that others might fill that gap.

"The U.S. has failed America\'s families by not meaningfully protecting child farmworkers from dangers to their health and safety, including on tobacco farms," said report co-author Margaret Wurth.
"Farming is hard work anyway, but children working on tobacco farms get so sick that they throw up."
The children also said they worked long hours \u2014 often in extreme heat \u2014 without overtime pay or sufficient breaks.
"The conditions are inhumane and they should improve them," said 17-year-old Erick Garcia, of Kinston, N.C. Garcia has been working in tobacco field since he was 11 to help his family earn more money.

After a minute or two, he swam toward the boat, pulling the shark with one arm.
"We\'re interested in what these sharks are doing when they\'re here," he said.
When there are too many of the kinds of fish sharks eat, such as mullet, problems can arise.
With too few plant-eating fish, algae can become overgrown and fragile coral reefs might be damaged.
Typically, the shark clamps down on a hand or foot in murky water and quickly lets go once it realizes it has not bitten down on a fish.

On a Tuesday morning off John D. MacArthur Beach State Park, Kajiura and his three students set out to hook sharks and fit them with audio transmitters.
The team had managed to catch two sharks, but the trip still ended up being a failure.
But because the water was so rough, Kajiura decided to head to deeper, smoother water first.
It will soon add new ones at Dania Beach and Juno Beach.

About 4,500 students in Orange County Public Schools participate in agriscience programs like the one at Colonial, Garner said.
But Orange County educators say studying agriscience can help students prepare for a wide range of careers.
App said helping students explore their options, including eliminating those that are a bad fit, is a major goal.
Students arrive on campus before the first class starts at 7:27 a.m. to feed the goats and come in on weekends and over school breaks.
"Cuba rejects and condemns all acts of terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, as well as any act whose objective is to encourage, support, finance or give shelter to terrorists," she said.
In his notification to Congress, Obama certified that "the government of Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding six-month period."
Since Obama and Castro announced they would move toward normalization, high-level Cuban and U.S. officials have held three rounds of talks on establishing formal relations.
But the administration has said that is not part of the law.
"I think it would be nice if the Cubans sent back the terrorists that they\'re harboring who have killed American law enforcement officers," McCain said.
"Our hemisphere, and the world, look very different today than they did 33 years ago," Secretary of State John Kerry said.
The announcement follows a pledge made by Obama and Cuban President Ra\xfal Castro to move toward normal relations.
If Cuba is taken off the terror list, only three countries remain.
For its part, the United States said that its officials must be able to freely move around the island.
Democratic Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois participated in the effort to reach an agreement with Cuba.

Hours earlier, a barrel bomb had struck a street, hitting three vehicles and killing eight people.
Not until the rumble had faded, leaving only a white trail across the sky, did the people return their attention to the boring particulars of life.
Then chaos "would break out and cars would start driving into each other and people would run, trying to get away."

As cousins Richard Norris and James Norris watched, a light wind began moving huge sheets of ice across the surface of the water.
Their photos last Dec. 21 provided the final evidence in solving a mystery of the Racetrack Playa that has long puzzled visitors and scientists: What is it that moves rocks across flat dirt in the heart of the hottest, driest place on Earth?
Rocks of various sizes \u2014 some weighing 600 pounds or more \u2014 leave trails that wiggle like snakes or form complete loops or even rectangles.
"In a place where rainfall averages 2 inches a year, rocks are being shoved around" by processes "typically seen in arctic climes."
Physicist Ralph Lorenz, who had investigated playa rock movement for a decade, believed so strongly that ice floes were the cause that he erected time lapse cameras in the area about seven years ago.
The Norrises subscribed to a different theory \u2014 that hurricane-force winds were the cause.
Richard Norris, 55, a biologist, and James Norris, 59, a research engineer, launched their "Slithering Stones Research Initiative" in 2011.
They were stationed at the southern end of the playa, where rocks begin their strange journeys after tumbling down a cliff.
Then, the rocks slid along the slushy, slippery mud along paths determined by the direction and velocity of the winds.
"While it takes away the mystery, it also underscores what an amazingly rare and wonderful" process "is at work there," Lorenz said.
Their photos last Dec. 21 solved a mystery of the Racetrack Playa that has long puzzled both visitors and scientists: What is it that moves rocks across flat dirt in the heart of the hottest, driest place on Earth?
They are cut sharply into the ground \u2014 but no other tracks are visible.
The playa was transformed into a shallow lake where the GPS stones recorded movements on sunny days, with light winds following nights of subfreezing temperatures.
The rocks slid along the slushy, slippery mud along paths determined by the direction and force of the winds.
The cracking sounds were loud.
On Dec. 20, the two cousins returned to inspect their devices.
The normally dry lake bed here in Death Valley National Park is known as "the Racetrack Playa."
Their photos last Dec. 21 solved a mystery of the Racetrack Playa that has long puzzled both visitors and scientists: What is it that moves rocks across flat dirt in the heart of the hottest, driest place on Earth?
"In a place where rainfall averages 2 inches a year, rocks are being shoved around" by forces "typically seen in arctic" climates.
The "GPS stones" were specially engineered to record movement and speed.
Panes of ice hundreds of feet across and as thin as 1/4-inch thick blew into rocks.
The rocks slid along the slushy, slippery mud along paths determined by the direction and force of the winds.
The cracking sounds were loud.
James Norris said about their discovery.
A playa is an area of flat dried-up land.
The proof that the rocks are moving is what they leave behind: trails in the dirt.
However, until that day last December, no one had been able to prove anything.
"There\'s a shortage of workers in a number of careers, and the numbers of those jobs are staggering," said Harley Hepner, the Illinois State Board of Education\'s chief adviser for agriculture education.
Classes include animal science, plant and soil science, as well as separate offerings of advanced animal and plant science, natural resources, and an introductory course.
Seven high schools in Kansas and four in Nebraska joined the group in the past school year.
It\'s helped me find my way back."
Classmate Alicia Perez once dismissed learning about agriculture, convinced "this is gonna be for people who wanna be farmers."
Not so, she now believes.
"My heart is in culinary arts, and there are so many different careers you can pursue in agriculture."
"The only thing I planted was a small garden, and the only thing that grew out of it were weeds," she says.
"This is about understanding the environment and the world around you as it relates to animals, plants and food, then going out with those skills to get a good career," he said.
"Before this (program) came, I was in a dark place.

His mother was a bookkeeper and his father was a construction worker who struggled with alcoholism.
"Her goal in life was to educate her children because she thought that was the only way out of Englewood," Richardson said, "and so she was a strict disciplinarian \u2014 stressed academics, stressed excellence."
"Part of it is having grown up in an area like this," he said.
"I think what makes you tick is the impact you have on lives," Richardson said.
That was her way of making sure her children avoided the dangerous path many young people took in Englewood, he said.
Richardson\'s neighborhood friends "were into all sorts of bad things," but they protected him and his younger brother, Lendell, who also became a doctor.
Three days a week, he helps them with their classwork at no charge.
There are many reasons why Richardson became a doctor, but it all started with his mother, Gladys Richardson.

LED technology now illuminates our smart phone screens and phone flashlights, as well as many household lights, and even the twinkling lights put on Christmas trees.
This year the highest award in science went to a discovery that benefits us all: lightbulbs.
"Something like a fourth of our electricity consumption goes to illumination," Nobel Prize committee member Professor Olle Ingan\xe4s of Sweden said during a press conference on Oct. 7, announcing the award.
"A lot of big companies really tried to do this and they failed," said Nobel committee member Per Delsing in Sweden.
The achievement required the growth of high-quality crystals, used as semiconductors.
Inside semiconductors, electrons and "holes," or spaces without electrons, can move around the crystal structure to allow electrical current to flow.
When the right voltage is applied to the semiconductor, electrons and holes will join and give off light.

U.S. President Barack Obama announced Saturday that he was postponing U.S. missile strikes against the Syrian government in order to first seek approval from Congress.
"We were happy when we first heard that the U.S. would attack, but then when it was postponed, we were afraid that Bashar would attack the camp," said Raad Zoubi, 23, who has lived in the camp for the past year.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that evidence showed sarin gas was used.
Camp residents heard Obama reveal his decision to postpone the operation on live broadcasts of his announcement Saturday.
And on Sunday, some in Congress doubted that Obama could win approval.

Pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria caused about a third of all the under-age-5 deaths, the report found.
However, some simple steps can help, he said, including newer vaccines against childhood diarrhea and pneumonia.
For newborns, early breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact are hugely important, Chopra added.

The Volkswagen car company has admitted cheating emissions tests in the United States.
The product they sell is tainted and the consumers they serve are furious, while the world waits to learn what the car company will do to resolve the problem.
Following an independent investigation, Volkswagen has owned up to installing "defeat devices" in as many as 11 million diesel engines.
"Volkswagen\'s acknowledged misconduct regarding its vehicle emissions has been extremely disappointing, and dealers are deeply concerned about how this breach of trust will affect their customers," said Charles Cyrill.
"Unlike the runaway Toyotas or the GM ignition switches, no one has died because of this problem \u2014 and people seem to forget that," the manager of a prominent Southern California VW dealership said.

Reports of bears damaging property or injuring people have fallen 92 percent \u2014 from 1,584 in 1998, to 120 last year.
Bear experts say the turnaround came from an unlikely plan \u2014 training the bears but, more importantly, training people.
There has never been a known case of a black bear killing a person in Yosemite, or anywhere in California.
Next, the park launched a public education campaign.
A study in March found a 63 percent drop in the proportion of human food that black bears now eat, compared with the 1970s and 1980s.
Damage from bears in the park has fallen an astounding 99 percent \u2014 from $659,569 in 1998, to $7,508 last year.
"Bears that get too (used) to people lose their fear of people," Johnson said.
"Although a bear has never killed a person in Yosemite, they certainly have the ability if they wanted to."
The less contact between the two, "the better for everybody," he said.
"More and more people are doing what they are supposed to do."
The less humans and bears meet, "the better for everybody."
Yosemite has 300 to 500 black bears.

The park also made campers store food in bear-proof lockers.
The less humans and bears meet, "the better for everybody."
Today, the bears are behaving better.
"Mother bears taught their cubs how to climb up and get it."
The more bears and people stay apart, "the better for everybody," he said.

More importantly, they are training people to keep food away from bears.
The more bears and people stay apart, "the better for everybody," he said.
The unemployment rate has steadily dropped, to 7.4 percent in August.
And employers have been collectively adding almost 200,000 new jobs a month in recent months.
In 1999, slightly more than half of teenagers 16 to 19 worked a summer job.
But by this year, that number had plunged to less than a third over June and July.
But falling teen employment is just as striking year-round over the past decade.
"Kids that get work experience when they are 17 or 18 end up graduating from college at a higher rate," said Michael Gritton.
Almost every person you ask remembers their first job because they started to learn things from the world of work that they can\'t learn in the classroom," he explained.
Even before the economy took a nosedive in the summer of 2008, workers aged 16 to 19 made up a shrinking share of the overall workforce.
Another part was that universities now place less importance on work and more on life experiences and volunteering.
Hall points to a troubling trend within an already worrisome number.

Goliath is the latest in a revolution in coaster construction, coaster fans say.
It twists wooden tracks into shapes never before seen, with inversions, over-banked curves and whip-crack reversals of direction.
Coaster lovers are already planning group outings.
The coaster is being built by the innovator in wooden roller coasters, Rocky Mountain Construction Group from Hayden, Idaho.
Before launching the business, Grubb was a carpenter and welder building coasters at Silverwood Theme Park in Idaho.
Rather than building tracks on-site, as done in the past, Rocky Mountain cuts, flexes and welds the steel into whatever shape is needed and fastens it to laminated pine in the shop.
The company wowed riders last year after it built the new Outlaw Run coaster at Silver Dollar City in Branson, Mo.
They are used to winter temperatures in northern Idaho that often drop below zero, but even they were taken aback by the latest Chicago winter, one of the worst on record.
Then will come after hundreds of test runs, featuring water-filled dummies wearing accelerometers to ensure that riders can endure forces more than three times the pull of gravity.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140506_ROLLERCOASTER.jpg" />CHICAGO \u2014 Alan Schilke is building a massive record-setting wooden roller coaster called Goliath at Six Flags Great America.
It will send riders at 72 miles per hour (mph) down an 85-degree, 180-foot cliff.
Rather than building tracks on-site, as done in the past, Rocky Mountain cuts, flexes and welds the steel into whatever shape is needed in the shop.
They are used to winter temperatures there that often drop below zero, but even they were taken aback by the latest Chicago winter.
Then will come hundreds of test runs with water-filled dummies to make sure that riders can endure forces more than three times the pull of gravity.

So Grubb and his engineers decided there must be a better way.

When finished, the ride is expected to last about a minute and a half.

Meanwhile, drones are becoming smaller, allowing them to infiltrate spaces that normally would not be reachable.
They can peek through windows, fly into buildings and sit, undetected, in corners or other small spaces.
Already, a basic model costs no more than a few hundred dollars.

Gears may seem like a man-made invention.
But the basic interlocking system found inside grandfather clocks and car steering systems has now turned up in the powerful legs of a certain young insect species.
When one leg starts to jump, the gear teeth on that leg engage with the gear teeth on the other.
Crocodile hearts have a toothed cog valve that may help them stay under water for longer periods.
"It\'s a wonderful example of the clever solutions that nature comes up with," said Robert Full, a scientist at the University of California, Berkeley who was not involved in the study.
An average human can withstand about 5 Gs of acceleration.
The pair used a very fast camera to photograph the planthoppers while they jumped.
Each gear strip was about 350 to 400 micrometers long \u2014 about half as thick as a credit card.
But sending a signal from the brain to coordinate both legs takes time.
When one leg starts to jump, the gear teeth on that leg meet with the gear teeth on the other.
It might take one or two milliseconds to send a message from its brain to its muscles.
The gear system is tens of times faster than a single bug thought.

The federal government and animal supporters are fighting again over the removal of wild mustangs from the Western range, even after the government announced plans to take fewer horses from the land this summer.
They argue that the agency is really helping ranchers whose cattle and sheep graze upon the public lands.
"The drought conditions are so severe we\'re going to see die-offs," BLM spokesman Tom Gorey said.

"We\'re tired of people trying to decide what would offend us," said Autumn Wind Scott, a Ramapough council member.
Mayor Frank Bivona said the survey was not a vote but rather a way to gauge opinion \u2014 the final decision will be made by elected officials.
He said he was surprised by the criticism from the Ramapough Lenape Nation, but acknowledged that the town had not reached out to them about any possible alterations to its logo.

The town of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, also has long used a picture of a Native American on its logo.
Now the town is thinking of dropping that image.
Dwaine Perry, a Ramapough chief, said there is a huge difference between the Franklin Lakes logo and the Redskins trademark.
The first is "a dignified image that represents the native people."
When artist Barbara Lawshe, now 80, found out that Franklin Lakes might update the logo she designed in the late 1960s, she initially thought: "That\'s fine \u2014 give mine a rest after all these years."
However, when she learned that the Native American figure could be dropped, she said her response was, "That\'s ridiculous.

"We\'re moving into a period of very unstable weather, and that\'s what producers need to be prepared for," said Jerry Hatfield, a scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Climate Corp. produces its forecasts from weather readings at 10 million locations.
And, it adds, even farmers who can\'t stomach the words "climate change" or "global warming" will find it useful.
But in the long run, changing environmental conditions present "unprecedented challenges."
The USDA estimates that wheat production across the Great Plains will drop 6 percent by 2050 because of warming temperatures.
"The variability from year to year is going be greater than it has been in the past," said soil scientist Charles Rice.
For instance, scientists are looking at how to develop a type of wheat that holds up better against the warming effects of climate change.
"Climate has changed, climate is changing," he said, "and climate is going to change in the future."
Farmers receive forecasts for rain, soil conditions and wind speed.
Guetterman said he would take some advice from a company.
A USDA report this year warned of increasing change in weather patterns and the effect on crops.
A Kansas State University study also points to serious problems ahead.
Farmers will have to have "money in the bank to pay for those poor years."

Scientists believe they know the cause of the crazy weather: climate change, or [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming), caused by humans when they burn fuels like gas.
Still, scientists are planning ahead.
They are trying to figure out ways for farmers to get a good harvest even if rain is less dependable and temperatures shift.
This works out to a loss of 10.6 bushels per acre.

Manning was accused of the biggest leak of classified information in U.S. history for delivering more than 700,00 pages of documents and videos to the Web site WikiLeaks.
The charges he was convicted of carry smaller sentences that could still add up to as much as roughly 130 years in prison, news organizations said.
That charge has not been used since the Civil War, the Washington Post said.

For their recent first-round playoff matchup with the Golden State Warriors, the Los Angeles Clippers had a little help on defense.
Computer "vision technology" keeps tabs on individual players by the number and color on their jerseys.
Teams can get reports based on the combined data 60 seconds after something has happened on the court, according to Kopp.
Before the start of this season, the league formally adopted the technology and made sure all NBA teams could use it.
The SportVU system can determine how fast players move, how often they change direction and how much they run during a game.
It can track how well players shoot from particular spots on the court.
The data reinforces what coaches already know in many cases, experts say.

In 2014 and continuing this year, there has been an alarming surge in the number of whales getting tangled in crabbing gear.
"There are a couple of things going on here, and they\'ve become political," said Jennifer Renzullo, a biologist at the University of California, Davis.
"More fishing pressure," she said, "combined with more whales hanging out in the area, are contributing to a spike in entanglements."
Seven others were disentangled and released from the lines.
A task force with representatives from the fishing industry, state and federal agencies and conservation groups is attempting to address the problem.
But last week, a coalition of environmental groups urged the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Fish and Game Commission to make significant changes before the next Dungeness crab fishing season off the West Coast begins in the fall.
Measures under consideration include closing fisheries in areas where whales are feeding, use of lines that break away when a trap catches onto a whale, and more efforts to collect lost and abandoned fishing gear.
"It\'s heartbreaking to know so many whales are getting tangled up in fishing gear," said Catherine Kilduff, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity.
Over the last four decades, protection efforts have led to steady population growth for humpbacks.
For more than a year, California state officials, crab fishermen and environmental groups have been watching with alarm as increasing numbers of whales have been getting tangled in fishing gear.
Environmental groups are urging state fisheries managers to take immediate steps to protect whales from injury and death.
"For some reason, humpback and gray whales that tend to migrate through areas such as Monterey Bay have been spending more time there," Renzullo said.
The fate of the other entangled whales remains unknown.
The current crab season ends June 30.
In the Pacific waters off the coast of California, two groups are coming into conflict: crab fishermen and humpback whales.
Off the coast of California, two groups are fishing the same waters: crab fisherman and whales.
Still, they say the environmental groups may be using the entanglements to pressure the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) into keeping humpback whales on the endangered species list.
"It\'s heartbreaking to know so many whales are getting tangled up in fishing gear," said Catherine Kilduff, a lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity.
"About 90 percent of the crabs harvested are caught within six weeks of the season opening.
Still, he suggested that environmental groups may be playing up the problem "to assure that humpback whales are not delisted" from the endangered species list.
So far in 2015, at least 25 whales have been trapped in fishing lines.

Somewhere in South Florida is a rare fern.
More than half, 26, are threatened or in danger of going extinct.
"Fern enthusiasts like me consider it a small price to pay," Possley wrote in an article about conservation.
First spotted in 1962, the rare fern was nearly wiped out about three years ago after the South Florida Water Management District began restoring the water flow to Biscayne Bay.
At three months, they measured about an inch tall, looking a little like parsley.
At about a year, the ferns were finally 2 to 3 inches tall and large enough to be potted and shipped to a greenhouse where Possley and other botanists have been growing about 300 rare ferns.
Fairchild is now working to identify land where rare ferns used to grow so they can be replanted.
Somewhere in South Florida, an extremely rare fern is barely hanging on in the wild.

In South Florida, a rare fern is struggling to survive.
Fourteen ferns have already disappeared.
The brown-hair fern managed to hold on, Possley said.
The fern was discovered in 2006 near Florida City in a location plant experts prefer not to give away.
So two years ago, a team led by Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden launched a rescue mission.
With 124 native ferns, Florida has more species than anywhere else in the United States outside Hawaii or Puerto Rico, Possley said.
Of those, 48 types of ferns grow in Miami-Dade County.
If the surviving ferns grew in large, protected preserves like Everglades National Park, Possley would worry less.
The areas are now surrounded by highways, business areas and busy neighborhoods.
Native ferns were once found all over South Florida.
They had admirers who flocked to fairy-like caves, braving thorny vines and spiders, in search of rare species.
The garden was able to plant its greenhouse-grown ferns in the wild, and the brown-hair fern managed to hold on, Possley said.
Possley would love to see the "little fairy gardens" that once drew tourists replanted.

Mike Freedman, who is with the botanic garden, spent months caring for the spores.
He made a special container to improve their chances of living.
Six weeks after the spores started growing, the ferns were still tiny.
At about a year, the ferns were finally 2 to 3 inches tall and large enough to be put in pots.

For Andre Bauma, Ndakasi is like his own child.
There are about 880 surviving wild mountain gorillas in the world, and about one-quarter of them reside in Virunga National Park.
"I love these gorillas, yeah, and I\'d like to just stay with them forever," Bauma says.
Ndakasi was 2 months old when Bauma found her holding on to her mother, who had been shot.
Besides the mother, six other Virunga mountain gorillas were shot dead in mid-2007.

After officials of the cemetery and the humane society moved out the herd of reporters, the goats ran into the fenced area and started doing what they do best: chomping everything green and leafy in sight.
"It\'s actually an ancient custom," said Williams, who\'s trying to bring new life and activities to the cemetery.
"I would not expect that," said Carol Johnson, a spokeswoman for the National Park Service.
But, she said, "It\'s certainly an interesting idea."

Researchers are preparing to set off explosive charges buried in two dozen 80-foot-deep wells drilled around the mountain.
"We\'ve been looking at what\'s beneath the volcano through very fuzzy glasses," said Seth Moran, a seismicity expert with the U.S. Geological Survey\'s Cascade Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Washington.
The explosive experiments scheduled for this summer are one part of experiments collectively called iMUSH for "Imaging Magma Under St.
Does it make its way upward in a single, narrow pipelike passage?
While an eruption is not near, the analysis showed a new supply of magma is slowly repressurizing the magma chamber beneath the mountain.
We have rocks that are crunching together that will eventually slip and create earthquakes."
She added, "Getting people out there helps them to recognize that these changes are happening."
Driedger and others draw comparisons between Mount Rainier in Washington and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, where 23,000 people were buried in a volcanic mud flow, or lahar, when the mountain erupted in 1985.
The explosive experiments scheduled for this summer are one part of experiments called iMUSH for "Imaging Magma Under St.
In addition to the explosive testing, scientists are preparing for experiments using enhanced receptors for naturally occurring seismic activity.
The goal is to "see" deep below St. Helens to the area where a tectonic plate from the Pacific is forced under the North American plate.
That knowledge, they say, will help them predict eruptions not only at St. Helens but also at other volcanoes around the world \u2014 and possibly save many thousands of lives.
This Cascade "subduction zone" is an area that can produce magnitude-9 earthquakes when the plates slip or break.
"Here in the Pacific Northwest we are literally living on the edge," she said.
"We have land being shoved beneath us, right under our feet.

While an eruption is not near, the research showed a new supply of magma is slowly building up beneath the mountain.
Steve Malone, now a professor at the University of Washington, was a seismicity superstar when St. Helens erupted 34 years ago.
He is involved in the iMush studies.
What makes it truly dangerous is not its eruptive force, but the lahars its eruptions are almost certain to generate.
Moran and other U.S. Geological Survey scientists confirmed last month that St. Helens remains active.
But thanks to Malone and others, they were able to roughly predict when the eruption would occur.
The 2,600 smaller seismometers that will be used in the explosive testing are smaller than a can of tennis balls.

But when his father died in 2002, Strawn shifted the family business to grass-fed cattle.
"Those animals that are raised in a pen are the cow equivalent of a couch potato," said Strawn.

Doctors have a warning for Congress: If it cuts food stamps, the federal government could be socked with bigger health bills.
Food stamps feed 1 in 7 Americans and cost almost $80 billion a year, twice what they cost five years ago.
The risks of hunger have not played a major role in the debate.
"If you\'re interested in saving health care costs, the dumbest thing you can do is cut nutrition," said Dr. Deborah Frank of Boston Medical Center.
It shows that they are 30 percent more likely to have been hospitalized for a range of illnesses.
About half of those receiving food stamps are children, and 10 percent are elderly.
Congress is now eyeing about $800 million a year in cuts.
According to the government, a family of four receiving food stamps is now getting $36 less a month.
"While this program is an important part of our safety net, our overriding goal should be to help our citizens with the education and skills they need to get back on their feet," said Rep. Eric Cantor.
Democrats and anti-hunger groups opposing the cuts say they could worsen health and raise health costs for the poorest.
A study published this week helps show that link.
"I wish they understood that if we did this better, we could save a lot more money in health care costs."
Republicans want bigger cuts than do Democrats.
Most states send out food stamps at the beginning of the month.
A 300-year-old Stradivarius violin on loan to Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra lead violinist Frank Almond was stolen after a performance, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said Tuesday.
As Almond lay on the pavement the robber fled to a nearby vehicle, which then left the scene, Flynn said.
"The artistic heritage of Milwaukee was assaulted and robbed last night," Flynn told reporters during the conference at the police station.
In a 2008 feature on the violin, Chicago violin dealer Stefan Hersh said the Lipinski violin was similar in value to another Stradivarius that sold for more than $3.5 million in a 2006 auction.
The violin\'s early owners included the virtuoso Giuseppe Tartini (1692-1770), known to listeners for his "Devil\'s Trill Sonata."
The instrument has also belonged to Polish violinist Karol Lipinski (1790-1861) whose name has stayed attached to it.
He added, "The vibrations of the music keep it alive."
In 2013, British police recovered a stolen 300-year-old Stradivarius violin that had been missing for more than two years.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said flatly: "The House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes.
One by one, senators rose from their seats to declare their votes as a packed Senate gallery looked on, including an entire section of college students and parents wearing bright blue "United We Dream" T-shirts.
The Senate vote showed strong support to the thousand-page bill painstakingly crafted by eight senators from both parties and amended this week to bring in some skeptics.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked the spirit of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, who worked to enact immigration legislation before his death in 2009.
"It reminds us that sometimes we focus so much on how immigrants could change America, that we forget that America changes immigrants even more."
They would achieve that status if they pass a background check, have not been convicted of a serious crime, pay any taxes owed and pay a $500 fine.

Twenty thousand additional Border Patrol agents would be added to the force of 18,400.
"Senator Kennedy knew the day would come when a group of senators divided by party, but united by love of country, would see this fight to the finish," Reid said.
After sailing through the Senate, it now faces a tough path through the House of Representatives, where Republicans outnumber Democrats.

And her multimillion-dollar effort has put South Florida at the forefront of a national debate over genetically modified foods.
"Consumers have a right to know what they\'re putting in their bodies," said Joshua Eggnatz, Leo\'s attorney.
General estimates are that about 90 percent of the corn, cotton, soybeans and sugar beets grown in the United States are genetically altered.
But its website says the agency "has not objected to the use of the term if the food does not contain added color, artificial flavors, or synthetic substances."
Still, more than 60 countries around the world \u2014 including Japan, Australia and the European Union \u2014 ban or significantly restrict the sale and production of the lab-concocted ingredients.
Congress is considering a bill that would direct the FDA to "clearly label" genetically modified foods.
The groundswell of public pressure for labels has persuaded Whole Foods to become the first major supermarket chain to require suppliers to add GMO labels to their products.

National parks have been dealing with a decline in overnight stays since the 1980s.
"I think we might be camping more," Kelly Minter said.
National Park Service spokesman Jeffrey Olson said the way Americans experience parks changed in the last 30 years.
Famous parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite are still full every weekend and require making reservations well in advance, Olson said.
The decline in camping may be more tied to Americans spending less time away from work than any lack of equipment and training.
A number of organizations have conducted analyses on the turf fields, including the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the University of California (UC), Berkeley.
Some studies have detected toxins such as benzene and carbon tetrachloride at turf fields.
The EPA admits that it is "not possible to extend the results beyond the four study sites or to reach any more comprehensive conclusions without the consideration of additional data."
The law is supposed to protect the public and environment from hazardous waste.
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation conducted a study and declared that crumb rubber fields pose "no significant environmental threat to air or water quality and poses no significant health concerns."
It concluded in a research review that "the materials are both cost-effective and safe."

"I\'ve been struggling to stay optimistic, to stay encouraged," said Briscoe, who is married and has a 5-year-old son with whom he is working to rebuild a relationship.
Albert Joseph Briscoe III attended grade school in Tennessee, then moved back to Minneapolis with his mother, Debra Haynes, to be closer to his grandmother, who largely raised him.
"But it wasn\'t cool" to be smart, he said, and the lure of the streets was strong.
His mother struggled to pay the bills to support him and his sister, but she guided them with love.

Earlier this year, two massive earthquakes struck in the Himalayan mountains in Nepal.
Should any of the dams burst, reservoirs as large as lakes could empty onto downstream towns and cities.
Although every nation has its own regulations, India and China are secretive about their dam designs.

In many cities of Xinjiang, the latest outdoors craze is parkour \u2014 a training routine that started in France and has spread worldwide.
Others laugh at propaganda posters, visible all over Xinjiang, that portray the Chinese Communist Party as a unifying force for ethnic harmony.
Similar to martial arts, parkour emphasizes self discipline and humility, though Jin said his group in Urumqi does not take that to extremes.
Members of the parkour club joke with each other like young competitors anywhere.
"This sport parkour brought us together from all over, regardless of ethnicity," said Wang Hui, 20, as he put his arms around two teammates \u2014 Parhat and Su Dan.

The 59-year-old Beijing suburbanite got a shock while visiting her new local graveyard, China Dragon Garden: She said she discovered her own name written in gold letters on a black granite tombstone.
Burials are a contentious and profitable business in China these days.
Shortages of gravesites in Beijing have gotten so bad that the city government doubled the money this year it gives to help pay for sea burials.
"The demand (for cemetery space) is relatively stable, but prices keep on going up," said Guo Yu, a 25-year-old sales representative at Wanfo Huaqiao cemetery in suburban Beijing, one the city\'s most respected.
The governments earn significant sums from selling plots or allocating land to cemetery developers, making the business ripe for corruption.
The Changping District Civil Affairs Bureau has been investigating the China Dragon Garden case and has put up a sign in front of the facility, labeling it an "illegal cemetery," according to local media reports.
But the Jinghua Times report said the operators also were eager to receive government certification because approval would qualify the graveyard for certain payments.

Many Americans reacted with a shrug when China landed its first lunar rover on the moon last month.
After all, the U.S. sent men to the moon more than 40 years ago.
In addition, experts say, the Chinese mission is testing new equipment and technology that could be useful for future missions \u2014 manned or unmanned.
"It\'s like saying you sent probes to the Earth, you looked at small areas of California and New York, and now you know everything there is to know.
Stephen Mackwell, director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, noted that the Chang\'e 3 mission landed in the right eye of the "Man in the Moon."
Then you can really start moving ahead from what was previously achieved."
It could also help scientists design equipment to mine the lunar surface for oxygen and other elements.
"The parts of the moon that have been explored are so minuscule," said former NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao.
And the vehicles are supposed to withstand two such long, cold nights during the course of the mission.
"So now we\'ll find out if we can do observations from the moon really effectively or it\'s easier to do it another way."
"By the time they get there, it may be 50 years since we did it, and that may not be a big deal."
Hopefully between now and then, we can talk about how to work with the Chinese, he added.

They will have to endure temperatures that may dip as low as minus 292 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 180 degrees Celsius.
As it turns out, Mackwell said, LADEE had enough time to gather some measurements.
He strongly disagrees with those who downplay Chang\'e 3\'s landing as "been there, done that."

Another way that GM foods help us is that they use less pesticide.
As one put it, there are more cancer-causing substances in a single cup of coffee than there are in all the small amounts of pesticides you eat and drink in a year.
The corn we eat today, for example, is the result of genetically modified plantings from thousands of years ago.
Within the last few hundred years, farmers began mating or cross-pollinating plants to grow more crops.

In the United States, glyphosate herbicide is sprayed heavily on most GMO crops.
Corn, soybeans, beets, wheat, beans and rice are all sprayed with it.
And a scientific report last year connected glyphosate to damage to the human gut and digestive system.
Glyphosate use has also resulted in uncontrollable, herbicide-resistant superweeds on much of U.S. farmland.
Meanwhile the EPA, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have given the green light to a scary new generation of GMO crops.
One of these was used to destroy crops and forests during the Vietnam War.
In addition, billions of pounds of chemical fertilizers are added to crops.
Back then, farmers bred plants by choosing the best ones to save for planting in the following year.

There is no scientific difference between them.
Right now, 1 person in every 9 does not have enough to eat on this planet.
One study found that they reduced the amount of pesticides by one-third.

It just means that there are very few pesticides in what we eat and drink.
GMO foods just use modern technology.

Organic foods are much more likely to be contaminated with microbes.
The reaction in Syria was notably divided.
"Events in Syria have been a tragic reminder that there remains much work still to be done," OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu told reporters in The Hague.
He said the $1.2 million prize money would be used to eliminate chemical weapons.
By giving the peace award to an international organization, the Nobel committee highlighted the Syrian civil war, without siding with any of the groups involved.
The war has devastated many cities and towns and forced millions of Syrians to flee their homes and country.
"If this prize is seen as if the chemical weapons inspections in Syria will help foster peace in Syria and in the region, it\'s a wrong perception," Safi told The Associated Press by phone from Qatar.
"Many more people are dying because Assad\'s troops are killing them with all types of conventional weapons," he said.
After an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds in Syria, Assad faced the prospect that the U.S. would launch a devastating strike against his military.
To avert that, he admitted to his chemical weapons stockpile and his government quickly signed on to the Chemical Weapons Convention.
The first OPCW inspection team arrived in Syria last week.
"They have huge stockpiles of chemical weapons," he told the AP.
An OPCW report this year said the United States had destroyed about 90 percent of its stockpile of the weapons.
However, some countries have not observed the deadline of April 2012 for destroying their chemical weapons.

He said the $1.2 million prize money would be used to get rid of chemical weapons.
Fayez Sayegh, a lawmaker and member of Assad\'s ruling Baath party, told the AP the award underscores "the credibility" of the Damascus government.
The United States, Albania, India, Iraq, Libya, Russia and a country identified by the OPCW only as "a state party" but widely believed to be South Korea have admitted to having chemical weapons.

The term "sanctuary city" has become a rallying cry for conservative Republicans seeking tougher immigration laws.
On July 23, House Republicans passed a bill aimed at punishing cities that refuse to share information with federal immigration authorities.
A federal court in Oregon decided that requests to hold immigrants for up to 48 hours, called detainers, were not sufficient reason to keep someone in jail.
In 1989, the city banned officials from enforcing immigration laws or asking about immigration status, unless required by law or court order.
In 2009, it began issuing municipal identification cards to get a public library card and sign up for park programs.
Places like Cook County, Illinois, and Santa Clara County, California, are trying to get immigrant communities to trust the police.
Last year, a number of localities that had long worked closely with ICE stopped holding detainers because of the ruling in Oregon.
They believe the new approach, combined with a focus on more serious offenders, will lead to better cooperation from local police.
Smaller city jails usually serve as short-term holding centers for less serious arrests.
Some Republican lawmakers are complaining that cities protect immigrants who are living in the United States without permission.

One-third of the food we consume depends on pollination by honeybees.
Beekeeping groups have held conferences.
Now, agricultural and chemical heavyweights are getting into the mix.
"The beekeeping industry has always crawled on its hands and knees to USDA and universities, begging for help," he said.
In 2006, beekeepers started noticing that bees were abandoning their hives, a phenomenon scientists call Colony Collapse Disorder.
The disorder is being blamed on mites and viruses.
"We have been systematically eliminating flowers that bees require for nutrition and survival," explained Marla Spivak, a University of Minnesota entomologist.
The study was prompted by massive bee die-offs in the spring, when corn planters were spewing dust containing neonicotinoids.
"I know, definitively, that there\'s a relationship between treated seed and spring die-offs," said Krupke.
"It would be a poor business model if we were poisoning the bees we depend on," he said.
He remembers a seven-year stretch in the 2000s when crop planes doused cotton fields with the insecticide malathion.
Bergman says his bee population plummeted, costing him $1 million and almost putting him out of business.

More than 300 years ago, inhabitants of this southern Chinese village built an elaborate drum tower.

Chicago children returned to school Tuesday, walking past more than 1,300 guards lining the streets in crime-ridden neighborhoods.
Thanks to $1 million from the city this year, another 100 "Safe Passage" workers were lining routes that students walk to get to school.
"It didn\'t happen, to the glory of God, and I think (very little) if anything, happened to children on their way to and from school," said Bishop Larry Trotter.
Chou said not one student was seriously injured along a Safe Passage route while guards were on duty last school year.
"She had to get to school earlier than the Safe Passage (workers) were on duty," said state Representative LaShawn Ford, who noted that Safe Passage workers were not on the street at 6 a.m. Ford has pushed for their hours to be expanded this year.

That new menu mixes the standard $1 items in with $2 goods and $5 family meals designed to, as McDonald\'s puts it, "fill the need for choice, flexibility and other preferences."
Restaurants have raised prices to cover increasing food and other costs, moving some favorites out of dollar territory.
In the past three years, the number of menu items priced at $1 or less plunged 26 percent at fast-food restaurants, according to research firm Mintel.
Jerry Brown signed off on raising the [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) in the state to $10 an hour from $8 by Jan. 1, 2016, a move that analyst Gordon said probably will push the fast-food industry to raise the lowest prices to $1.99 from 99 cents.
Health researchers who blame fast food for a long list of ailments, including diabetes and obesity, argue that value menus make such meals even more accessible.
Some formerly loyal customers such as Aesha Adams Roberts would now rather buy a bag of dried beans for dinner.
Burger King last summer debuted a $1 burger stuffed with french fries, which it touts as "new twists on American classics."

Three scientists from Sweden, the United States and Turkey won the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for showing how cells repair damaged DNA.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said their work on DNA repair had provided "fundamental knowledge" about how cells function.
Lindahl, 77 and now mostly retired, was a group leader at the Francis Crick Institute and a director of Cancer Research UK at Clare Hall Laboratory in Britain.
Modrich, 69, is an investigator at Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a professor at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Sweden_Nobel_Prize_Edit.jpg" /> Sancar said the news was "quite a surprise" since he thought his best chance to win a Nobel was in the medicine category, which was announced Monday.
Modrich, on vacation in New Hampshire, said he found out about his prize via an email from a co-worker.
"Stockholm didn\'t get my number, I guess, until later in the morning," he said.

DNA is inside the human body.
Scientists used to think the DNA in human bodies was safe from harm.
In 2002, he replaced that system with newer technology, but he hit a snag when air-quality standards called for expensive retrofits to reduce air pollution.
Then, unexpected pollution problems, regulatory roadblocks and low rates of return killed most of them, leaving only a handful in operation.
"If these digesters run properly, they can reduce odors associated with manure, stabilize nitrogen and have a number of environmental benefits," said John Blue, a climate change adviser.
Manure is fed into a digester, which extracts methane from decomposing organic material, removes impurities, and burns it to produce energy.
CH4 technicians will be able to monitor it remotely and will be readily available if it breaks down.
Brewer said he tested his system in other states, such as Wisconsin and Idaho, before shopping it around to California dairy farmers, who he said were very skeptical.
A decade or so ago, dozens of California dairy farmers built million-dollar systems called methane digesters.
At the same time, the state is trying out a simpler permitting process to help remove costly regulatory hurdles.
He said he is optimistic that this go-around \u2014 his third try to make a system work \u2014 will finally pay off.
"If these digesters run properly, they can reduce odors associated with manure, stabilize nitrogen and have a number of environmental benefits," said John Blue.
That presents a continuing challenge for farmers to dispose of the waste and control the methane produced by decomposing manure.
"You have a lot of dairy farmers who put these things on and found themselves willy-nilly in the energy business," said Stacey Sullivan of Sustainable Conservation, a San Francisco environmental group.
After hearing of the improvements, he decided to "give it another whirl," Koetsier said.
That way, a dairy operator can just focus on making milk, not running a small power plant.
After hearing of the new changes, he decided to "give it another whirl," Koetsier said.
Dairy farmers have plenty of manure lying around to change into energy.
He eventually shut down the system, in 2009.
"If these digesters run properly, they can reduce odors associated with manure, stabilize nitrogen and have a number of environmental benefits," said John Blue.
"Talk about apprehensive," Brewer remarked.
And for the past three decades, he has tried unsuccessfully to turn the stinky dung into energy.
"If these digesters run properly, they can reduce odors associated with manure... and have a number of environmental benefits," said John Blue.
He decided to shut down the system in 2009.
CH4 signed its first contract with Koetsier.
His new system should meet strict clean air rules in the highly polluted San Joaquin Valley.
Those digesters turn manure into power.
Only a handful are still in use.
"If these digesters run properly, they can reduce odors associated with manure... and have a number of environmental benefits," said John Blue.
Other firms are expected to follow.
The challenge is persuading dairy farmers to give digesters another try.
Their generators put out nitrogen oxide, a gas which is part of smog.
The current generation of digesters has better technology.
Ray Brewer, president of CH4 Power, drew Koetsier back to the digester idea.
He promised a new, less risky way of doing business.
And the company will be available if it breaks down, Brewer said.

After NASA retired the space shuttle in 2011, the U.S. lost the ability to send its own astronauts to the station, which orbits about 220 miles above Earth.
Florida also could benefit, with SpaceX flying cargo missions to the station from Cape Canaveral.
"ISS is now in its most productive era of utilization for scientific research and technology demonstration ...," noted the NASA document.
Keeping the station going until 2024 gives these U.S. companies a chance to fly the NASA missions for several years.

NASA is paying Russia about $1.7 billion through 2017 to transport them.
In 2008, the crew averaged only three hours of science work a week.
NASA is paying Russia through 2017 for the service.
Now, the six-member team is doing at least 50 hours weekly.
A longer mission could force NASA to make tough decisions about money in the future.
However, the backing of President Barack Obama might make it harder for the next administration to go back on the decision.
This decision will hopefully help "our international partners as they struggle with decisions on funding for their space programs," said NASA Chief Charlie Bolden.
By keeping the space station operational, NASA can maintain its technical advancement.
With that, the U.S. lost the ability to send its own astronauts to the station, which orbits about 220 miles above Earth.
NASA officials said they were confident they could keep the station going for years, despite occasional troubles.
For instance, last month a problem had to be repaired by spacewalking astronauts.
It found that operations could be kept going through at least 2028.
In its early years, little science was done aboard the space station.
Research includes Earth observation and the study of cosmic rays, which are energy particles that travel through space.
Astronauts have been doing shifts on board the station for more than a decade, often in six-month intervals.
In 2003, China became just the third country to launch an astronaut into space.
NASA officials said they were confident they could keep the station in space for years.
But, a report in December found that the station could be kept going through at least 2028.

The flight of the unmanned aircraft, dubbed X-47B "Salty Dog 502," could redefine naval aviation.
Landing on an aircraft carrier at sea as it pitches with the waves is considered an extremely difficult feat for even the most seasoned pilot.
A human pilot would design its flight path and send it on its way; a computer program then would guide it from a ship to the target and back.
The drone also has a weapons bay with a payload capacity of 4,500 pounds, though the Navy said it has no plans to arm the aircraft.
It continued testing there until last year, when it was trucked from the Mojave Desert to Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland.
The U.S. Navy conducted a historic test flight Wednesday when an experimental bat-winged drone landed aboard an aircraft carrier at sea for the first time.
The X-47B was controlled almost entirely by computer for the flight.
It has a range of more than 2,400 miles and can reach very high speeds.
The drone also has a weapons bay with a capacity of 4,500 pounds, though the Navy said it has no plans to arm the aircraft.
The first X-47B had its initial flight from Edwards Air Force Base in 2011, where it continued testing until last year when it was trucked from the Mojave Desert to a Naval Air Station in Maryland.
The Navy also conducted other tests to demonstrate the capability to safely operate the X-47B on an aircraft carrier flight deck.
There were two X-47Bs developed and built under a contract that has climbed to $1.4 billion.

Members of the MENA community are now asking the Census Bureau to create a separate "MENA" category for the 2020 count.
"White," they argue, makes them invisible in population counts.
"Education is obviously a key point," says Sarab Al-Jijakli, the Brooklyn-based president of the Network of Arab-American Professionals.
Since 1980, the Census Bureau has counted the growing Arab-American population from an ancestry question on the form.
Counting non-Arabs such as Iranians, Turks, Chaldeans and Armenians would bring the MENA population up to 5 million, according to Helen Hatab Samham, of the Arab-American Institute.
"More of us would identify as people of color."
Currently, the census lists five races \u2014 black, white, Asian, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native and one ethnic category, Hispanic.
Meanwhile, the "East Asian" category separated into ones for Koreans, Filipinos, Japanese and "Hindus," or South Asians.
The stakes were high: Except for freed slaves given citizenship in 1864, non-whites were not allowed citizenship for many years.
Because he was born in Lebanon, the United States considered him to be "Chinese-Mongolian" and not qualified for citizenship.
The bureau will test a new MENA category in 2015 and 2016.
Categories shift over time," said Akram Khater, a professor at North Carolina State University.
"Those who are Arab- and Iranian-American are starting to construct this community called MENA that is as real or as false as everything else in this country."
Every 10 years, the government counts the number of people in each state.
But for Americans of Middle Eastern and North African background, or "MENA," it\'s a real head-scratcher.

Scientists have found that exercise can increase the size of the hippocampus and increase levels of a protein that aids the growth of new brain cells.
Scientists found, for example, that people who said they exercised for 30 minutes, five times a week in late-middle age did better on tests of mental performance.
At all ages, people who exercised did better on brain tests.

The rooms must be able to survive getting hit by objects flying at 250 miles per hour, Erwin says.
The window glass can withstand getting hit by flying wood.
It offers to pay three-fourths of the cost if school districts or towns ask for the money.
In northwestern Missouri, the Mid-Buchanan School District has asked for money to build a safe room for 1,000 people at the school.

It started after a Liberian named Thomas Eric Duncan traveled to the Dallas area from West Africa, became ill and eventually tested positive for the deadly virus that has killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa.
Woahloe said she got calls from at least two Liberian workers who said people told them they should leave the United States.
Stanley Gaye, president of the Liberian Community Association of Dallas-Fort Worth, addressed a crowd of reporters who had urgent questions: "Do you know the Ebola patient?"
Gaye said the last thing Liberians need is to be blamed as a group.
Gaye said the Liberian community had met a month ago with officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Dallas area to learn what they could do for relatives suffering from Ebola back home in the impoverished nation.
"This is more than just about words," said Moore, who fled civil war in Liberia and has lived in Dallas for 14 years.
Ebola is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of infected people who have signs of the disease, such as bleeding or vomiting.
They will urge citizens who might have come in contact with Duncan to go to the hospital and to contact the CDC.

On Wednesday night, Woahloe, a registered nurse, appeared with several Liberian pastors and community leaders to spread the word: "Please don\'t blame Liberians."
Gaye said the Liberian community had met a month ago with officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Dallas area.
Health care in Liberia is not very good and even ambulances are scarce.
The CDC is responsible for protecting America from health and safety threats due to disease.

The city of Salem, which has spent much of the past three centuries both enjoying and atoning for its grim history, plans to install a plaque at the humble spot.
Authorities are also seeking funds to clean up the area and ready it for a flood of tourists.
A doctor diagnosed the cause as supernatural, and under pressure from local officials, the girls blamed three local women.
Before long, the "affliction" spread to nearly a dozen girls, and more than 200 people would be accused of witchcraft.
According to accounts at the time, she was carted to a spot called "Gallows Hill" for her hanging, as were 18 other accused "witches."
Giles Corey, the 20th person to be executed for witchcraft, was killed by an ancient punishment called peine forte et dure because he refused to enter a plea of guilt or innocence.
Pinpointing the spot where 19 Salem "witches" died turned out to be an investigative feat.
It was a sensible conclusion, given the name and the fact that witnesses identified the hill as the execution spot.
So the seven-member Gallows Hill Project team, which included Baker and other Salem scholars, began combing through the documents looking for alternate sites.
"He must have read every deed and will in the courthouse," said author Marilynne Roach, a member of the research team.
The city of Salem acquired that strip of land in 1936 and called it "Witch Memorial Land," according to Baker.
There are no artifacts to be found and no buried remains, because the soil was too shallow for burials, Baker said.
And the researchers who found the site of their last breaths will have the satisfaction of a mystery solved.
Then, even as Bishop said she was innocent, the ladder was kicked out from under her.
Bishop was the first of 19 people to be hanged in this spot, more than 300 years ago, during the Salem witchcraft trials.
And the researchers who found the site of their deaths will have the satisfaction of solving the mystery.
In the 1690s, more than 200 people were accused of witchcraft.
The morning of June 10, 1692, started with a hanging in Salem, Massachusetts.
Bridget Bishop was a Salem woman convicted of witchcraft.
Her hands were bound behind her back, her legs and petticoat tied tight.
It let everyone witness "an example of what happens to people who break the law," said historian Emerson "Tad" Baker, a member of the Gallows Hill Project, which found the spot.
People come to Salem from all over wanting to know where the hangings happened, said Kenneth Glover.
Now Glover can tell them, if he wants to.
Under pressure from local officials, the girls blamed three local women.
Some believed that the men and women were hanged at the top of a hill in Salem, which is now called Gallows Hill.
It was a reasonable conclusion, given the name and the fact that witnesses identified the hill as the execution spot.

And I think that becomes even more painful when you\'re separated from your family."
The friends she does have in Mexico are almost all recent returnees from the Unites States.
She had fantasized about attending the University of Missouri or Indiana University and studying journalism or international relations.
She ended up finding a low-paying job at a call center, one of thousands where telephone and cable companies, among others, hire Americanized returnees to take customer service calls from the United States.
"I guess I should have stayed," she told her sister.
"It would have just taken me two years.

Until she found them, she felt as if no one in this huge city understood her homesickness.
Pinzon entered the seventh grade at Oxford Middle School in Overland Park.
She joined the yearbook committee, sang with the chorus and danced with the Dazzlers drill team.
Ali still hopes to attend college in Mexico.
Pinzon was 17 then and living in the United States illegally.

Blame Facebook if you feel sad on a sunny day.
The research may be important for a world increasingly connected by the Internet.
On the other hand, posts that expressed feelings like anger or sadness caused more angry or sad posts.
The study was published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.
said study author James Fowler.
"What people feel and say in one place may spread to many parts of the globe," the authors wrote.
Fowler and study co-author Dr. Nicholas Christakis have written papers about social networks.
Russell Lyons, a math professor at Indiana University, criticized another paper by them.
Humans naturally tend to express their feelings rather than hide them.
Laughter, for example, may come from the "play face" seen in apes when they are relaxed.
It would cause a wave of good feelings, he said.

Similar die-offs have occurred before, but an event of this size has never been documented.
In Alaska, evidence of the disease was first observed last summer on Kayak Island, a remote island in the Gulf of Alaska.
On the island, a number of diseased sea stars were discovered, disproving an earlier theory that the illness was linked to warmer water, Raimondi said.
"It was the last place on earth where we would have expected to see it," he explained.
Nicole Abeln, the animal care technician, pulled out a white folder labeled "Sea Star Wasting Disease Information and Logbook."
Symptoms ranged from white patches on the arms to a sea star that lost two arms during the day.
"We\'re in the same mystery boat as the rest of the world," Danner said.
These symptoms are actually seen all the time, he said, and are put down to stress, such as a starfish drying out or getting sick.
The science so far appears to show that starfish species are affected differently depending on their physical location.
For sea star species in tide pool areas, the sores show up and are followed by tissue decay, Raimondi said.
Death might follow in a matter of weeks, or even not at all.

In Alaska, evidence of the disease was first observed last summer on remote Kayak Island.
And at that point, the illness started showing up all over the West Coast.
Nicole Abeln, an animal care technician, pulled out a folder called "Sea Star Wasting Disease Information and Logbook."
One entry from a trip to Whittier on Aug. 25 reports that they found "one sea star twisted and looking deflated."
That sea star was so ill that the scientists eventually killed the animal to end its suffering.
The museum put to death a total of eight suffering sea stars between August and November.
Symptoms ranged from white patches on their arms to a sea star that lost two arms during the day.
Raimondi said the symptoms are more present in starfishes kept in aquariums and zoos.
He also said that the term "wasting" describes the symptoms.
But Raimondi explained that the sea stars are still getting the disease in the wild and in places where they belong.
These are not unlucky animals that have been washed up on a beach, but starfish in their normal environment.

Officials have also discussed building about 50 "tsunami safe havens," such as artificial hills that could hold as many as 800 people.
More than 100 bridges would be lost, power lines knocked down and coastal towns cut off.
Officials in Northern California, Oregon and Washington are beginning to address the dangers of an earthquake and tsunami.
A 9.0 earthquake there in 2011 created a huge tsunami that swept through coastal areas.
That tsunami took people by surprise.
It killed more than 10,000 and left more than 300,000 homeless.
During the 2011 Japan tsunami, scientists underestimated its size and did not realize the damage it would do.

Scientists had believed that the Cascadia fault could only produce a 7.5 earthquake.
On March 16, a small earthquake caused by the Cascadia fault erupted 50 miles off the coast, causing light shaking.
A giant tsunami along the West Coast would wash away towns, destroy U.S. Highway 101 and cause $70 billion in damage.
One of these at a school in Washington will protect 1,000 people with a high wall.
The Cascadia fault is dangerous for two reasons.
Second, it is an area where two huge tectonic plates are being pushed under the even-larger North American plate.
Once every couple hundred years, the North American plate snaps back upward like a rubber band, creating a strong earthquake.
It could be 100 years from now," said earthquake expert David Oppenheimer.
They hope to learn lessons from a 2011 disaster in Japan.
They hope that new tsunami detectors deep under the ocean can provide early warnings.
To escape a tsunami, people must get to high ground such as a hill or mountain.
One of these at a school in Washington will protect 1,000 people with a high wall.
These earthquakes can cause a huge wave that floods coastal cities.
The Cascadia fault is made up of three tectonic plates that push against each other.

Bunch said, "We wanted to have that right tension of the building and one of the most sacred spaces in America."
It serves as a compelling example of how Jim Crow-era segregation laws separated blacks and whites in public places.
"This rail car \u2026 is a tangible remnant from America\'s long years of segregation, and those remnants are rare," said Peter Claussen, chairman and CEO of Gulf &amp; Ohio Railways that donated the rail car to the museum.
But Bunch, who raised the money and found the objects, had to make sure people believed that the museum would be built.
He imagined a boxlike structure with 10 stories \u2014 five above ground, five below.

He is referring to the cicada species that descends on parts of the East Coast every 17 years.
But for a few weeks this summer, he gets to lead cicada tours, hold cicada parties, plan cicada movie festivals, and even eat fried cicadas.
"We have a pair of mating cicadas on this plant over here," he shouts back to the dozens of hapless New Yorkers following him.
The pilgrims thought that cicadas were locusts, like from the plague in the Bible.

A few superstar professors pull in upward of 10,000 students around the globe for free, or nearly free, courses.
Because of his knack for acing tests, Roosemberth was selected more than a year ago to take part in a gifted students program at the University of El Salvador.
It was there he heard a talk by Carlos Martinez, an electrical engineering professor and strong advocate for online courses.
The teenager signed up for MIT\'s "Circuits and Electronics" course.
"Approximately 10 percent of the 1.3 million people on the edX platform come from Latin American countries," Dan O\'Connell, a spokesman for edX, said.
"These students got into these courses enthusiastically," said Jorge Zetino Chicas, an engineering professor at the University of El Salvador.
The university offers no credit for the online courses, but students want the prestige of a certificate for a completed course from MIT or other famous institutions.
So I signed up for \'Justice\' by Professor Michael Sandel," Mendoza said, referring to a Harvard professor whose hugely popular course deals with justice, equality and democracy.
He says he\'s aced a course called "Machine Learning" by hot-shot Stanford professor Andrew Ng: He scored a perfect 100.
I\'d tell myself, \'It\'s worth losing a little sleep over,\'" Roosemberth said.
And he was excited by the courses.
"They\'ve been really worthwhile because I\'m learning things I don\'t learn in school, and that I don\'t think they even teach in the university here," he said.

The FBI is sending agents and technical experts to assist in investigating the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jet.
U.S. officials said they are looking at whether this could be terrorism, as they would with any plane crash until they know otherwise.
But, a senior counterterrorism official said "there is no indication this is a terrorist attack; stolen passports are certainly not indicative of a terrorist attack."
Law enforcement officials were not allowed to speak publicly.
The NTSB could get involved because the jet was built by Boeing in the U.S. An official at the Department of Homeland Security said it would be a first if the plane was brought down by two terrorists who boarded the jet carrying stolen passports.
He noted that in the United States, passports and other travel documents are immediately run through a computer database.

"But so far what happened is a mystery," he said.
The official said there was "no evidence" of terrorism so far.
The Department of Homeland Security is in charge of preventing terrorist attacks against the U.S. An official there said it would be a first if the plane was brought down by two terrorists who boarded the jet carrying stolen passports.

According to experts, underinflated footballs are easier to throw and catch.
Patriots coach Bill Belichick said his team did not do anything wrong.
"We feel like we followed the rules of the game to the letter," he said.
The balls were inflated in a warm room by NFL officials and then used in the game, which was on a cold day.
After they were taken out of the warm room there would be an even bigger drop in temperature, and a bigger drop in air pressure.
During halftime, the Colts had claimed that the balls used by the Patriots offense were underinflated.
This is not the first time that the Patriots have been accused of cheating.
And I\'m proud of this team," he said.
"We feel like we followed the rules of the game," he said.
I\'m not an expert," he said.

Young said he could envision hunters using drones to drive wildlife to them or to locate wildlife beforehand and then go to that spot to hunt.
"So the use of drones would basically reduce the element of fair chase, which is an important principal of hunting," Young said.
"I believe in doing things the old way, and it\'s not hunting to me if it\'s too easy," Bostic, 56, said.
Linda Estrada, director of Animal Welfare League in Chicago Ridge, Illinois, said she also agreed with banning drones to hunt.
Scouting involves exploring a possible hunting area ahead of time to gather information on animal whereabouts, herd or flock sizes and best spots to hunt from.
Jason Parent, a New Hampshire state legislator who owns a hunting guide service, has been a vocal proponent of being able to use drones for scouting in his state.
Parent said hunters already use stand-alone cameras to watch for animal activity and tree stands that allow hunters to see an area from a better point.
In keeping with the fair-chase doctrine, Illinois already outlaws such conduct as using ferrets to frighten or drive mammals from their dens or hiding places; having dogs pursue, bother or kill deer; using lights connected to a vehicle to hunt at night; baiting deer and turkey; and shooting most birds when they are not flying.
Using any computer software or service to remotely control a weapon that takes wildlife is also banned.
The hunter could be charged with a crime for breaking the law.
There are several steps that Illinois takes to preserve what is known as "fair chase" in hunting.
He said using drones to scout could be good for business, saving customers time and money and increasing the chances they would find an animal.

An Illinois lawmaker wants to prevent hunters from using drones.
There are several steps that Illinois takes to preserve what is known as "fair chase" in hunting.
The proposed law would build on an existing Illinois law that prohibits using drones to interfere with hunters or fishermen.
Morrison decided to propose the law after talking to officials at the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.
Young said the Illinois wildlife police have not yet received complaints or reports of anyone using drones while hunting.
"So the use of drones would basically reduce the element of fair chase, which is an important principle of hunting," Young said.
Other states, including Montana, Alaska and Colorado, already limit the use of drones in hunting.
John Bostic owns a guide business and has been hunting for more than 40 years.
The drone can be outfitted with video equipment to send images and information from the wilderness back to an operator flying the drone by remote control from the ground.

It recently launched an "Alpha Wear" clothing line and an Internet radio station that draws 60,000 people monthly by broadcasting tunes featuring graduates.
She said Alpha also plans to expand and modernize its training for young students to ensure the famed music program survives.
During a break, he and most of his classmates said they dream of becoming pro musicians.
"It won\'t be just instrument playing, but rather the whole business of music," she said.

So he was interested when Marine recruiters showed up in 1942: They were seeking young men like him who knew both English and Navajo.
That day, Nez helped form an elite, top-secret group that became known as the Navajo code talkers.
For 13 weeks, Nez and the others were confined to a room where they were instructed to come up with words to represent the letters A to Z, as well as a code for military terms.
Messages that had taken 30 minutes to code and decode using other systems were translated and deciphered \u2014 decoded \u2014 in 20 seconds.

Then, he had to wash out his mouth with bitter soap.
So, Nez was interested when Marine recruiters showed up in 1942: They were seeking young men like him who knew both English and Navajo.
Using the Navajo language, they developed an unbreakable military code.
Nez was born in 1921 in Two Wells, New Mexico.
When he was about 9, his father packed him off to government boarding schools to learn English.
The Marines showed up at his high school in the spring of 1942.
It was there that they learned just how challenging their task would be.
The Japanese had already broken every code used by the U.S. and its allies.
Navajo was perfect for the task: It had no written form, its grammar was complicated and it featured unusual sounds.
They were instructed to come up with words to represent the letters A to Z, as well as a code for military terms.
He was at the Battle of Bougainville in New Guinea in November 1943, Guam in July 1944 and Peleliu and Angaur in September 1944.
"I worried every day that I might make" a mistake "that cost American lives," Nez told CNN a few years ago.
"Not even another Navajo could" decode it "if he wasn\'t a code talker."

About 252 million years ago, long before there were even dinosaurs, most of the living things on Earth died.
To figure out which microbe might been responsible, Rothman took his research to Fournier.
The new gene allowed it to produce methane more easily than ever before.
The researchers cannot say for certain that the microbe and the huge amount of methane it produced were responsible for the end-Permian extinction.
Still, they do have one more line of evidence to support their idea.

Inside the gallery, artworks by Syrian artists drew auction bids from collectors.
The Syrian refugee diaspora \u2014 now at 2 million and growing \u2014 has fanned out across the region and beyond for more than two years.
"It\'s a tragedy what is happening there now, but it would be an even bigger tragedy if all this art and culture that Syria has so much of would be lost," said gallery owner Hisham Samawi.
A signed copy sold for $12,000 at the auction, which was attended by more than 300 people.
"The artists are paramount, so we had to get them out," said gallery owner Samawi.
But these efforts are made more complicated by the deepening battles and the increasing lockdown in Damascus over threats of possible U.S.-led military action.
Meanwhile, Ayyam crews managed to ship about 3,000 artworks as fighting intensified in the Syrian capital.

In a pre-calculus class at John Champe High School in Loudoun County, Virginia, juniors and seniors are learning abstract mathematical ideas.
Meanwhile, in a personal-finance course, 16- and 17-year-olds are learning about something that might seem even more abstract for the teenagers: retirement.
Results from the 2012 Program of International Student Assessment showed that U.S. teenagers were in the bottom half for financial literacy among the 18 countries that participated, ahead of France and Spain but below Russia and China.
An economics and personal-finance class is now a required course for those who want a high school diploma in Virginia.
Northern Virginia now has one of the best personal-finance education programs in the country, according to Working In Support of Education, a New York City-based nonprofit that designs personal-finance lessons for high school students.
She thought it could make her more competitive for colleges looking for students with challenging course loads and could give her a chance to earn college credit ahead of time.
In the class, taught by former lawyer Mary Doherty, students learn about personal-finance issues that could affect them at nearly every stage of their lives.
They will learn about the potential pitfalls of using credit cards and how to be smart about spending and budgeting.
They also will learn about applying for college loans and the cost of higher education, something that is important to many of them.
They will get to know about various kinds of retirement savings accounts, something far away but that many experts believe is a vital topic that many people put off until too late.
"This class is like a wake-up call," senior Lainie Gibbs, 17, said.
Teacher Toni Fasan, a former banker, said the biggest jaw-dropping moment for her students is when they do a budgeting exercise, learning how much it costs to raise a family in wealthy Loudoun County.

The guy in charge might have a doctorate degree in biology, as does Christian Sidor of the Burke Museum.
They had so far uncovered about 7 feet of it at the South Lake Union apartment complex construction site where it was found Tuesday.
Eventually, people will be able to view the tusk at the museum, where it will help them learn about life in the Puget Sound region when it resembled an Arctic plain.
Right now, Sidor said, he figured the tusk was probably 22,000 years old \u2014 or maybe even 60,000 years old.
The region most likely had three or four herds of the mammoths, with each herd consisting of 30 to 40 animals.
But, Koppelman said, "community involvement is very important" to the company.
He said animals would have eaten most of the mammoth, but not the tusk because it had no nutritional value.
On the east side of the construction site is the backside of a building housing the Bright Horizons Child Care.
The kids and staffers there certainly hoped more of the mammoth would be found, and talked about how neat that would be.
"There is nothing as complete as this," he said.
There are no laws that would have prevented AMLI from going ahead with construction and destroying the tusk.
He said animals would have eaten most of the mammoth, but not the tusk because it had no nutritional value as food.
The child care workers made plans to watch at 4 p.m. Friday, when the tusk is expected to be lifted up.

The $280 million moon-orbiting mission will last six months and then LADEE will take a suicide plunge into the moon.
NASA hopes to eventually replace its traditional radio systems with laser communications, which would be faster and use significantly less power and smaller devices.

For the first time in nearly 100 years, the rare Sierra Nevada red fox was spotted in Yosemite National Park.
The red fox \u2014 one of 14 mammals protected by California \u2014 was seen on motion-sensitive cameras on Dec. 13 and Jan. 4.
Park officials are still trying to determine whether the cameras caught the same fox or a different one.
Little is known about the foxes because sightings are so rare.
Determined to photograph the fox again, wildlife biologists placed cameras in Tioga Pass.
The fox was videotaped biting on a bait bag containing chicken scraps.
University of California, Davis researchers analyzed samples of saliva from the bag.
Two years ago, Cobb and her husband spotted a red fox during a deer hunting trip at the Sonora Pass.
Researchers will continue to look for the Sierra Nevada red fox.

Many middle school students in south-central Alaska spent spring break playing video games.
Grayson Davey, an eighth-grader, spent most of his week off looking for new employees.
The fire-starter bracelet looks like many other woven bracelets being sold online to outdoor enthusiasts.
When unwound, the fire-starter bracelet reveals not only 17 feet of military-grade paracord, but also a piece of firesteel and a striker that can be used to start a fire.
When your adventure goes wrong, "what you have on you is your survival kit," he said.
Since he began making them in 2013, at the age of 11, Grayson has sold more than 1,000 of his fire- starter bracelets and fire bugs, a version that connects to a keychain and contains a mylar signal mirror and X-Acto knife.
Over spring break, he picked out two possible employees, and he is looking for at least three more.
"I want to grow the company as big as I can and at least get enough money for college," Grayson said.

Now, governments and intelligence agencies with which Washington has worked regularly, whether in Europe, the Middle East, or elsewhere, will hesitate before working too closely with the United States.
What has raised the number of those inclined to cause harm to Americans is the torture itself, not its description in the Senate report.
It is all these actions taken together that make us a target for a new generation of extremists.
Even today, we stand practically alone in refusing to acknowledge Palestine as its own nation, and in protecting Israel in the U.N. Security Council.
To be clear, the report was revealing only in its raw detail of CIA activities against particular prisoners.
That means more militants with more motivation to plot and launch more attacks against more Americans.
Despite those, the release is not likely to lead to any immediate increased risk to Americans.
It is all these actions taken together that make us a target for extremists.
The U.S. signed the U.N. Convention Against Torture, making torture committed anywhere in the world a crime.
That means more militants will give themselves more reasons to launch more attacks against more Americans.
It gives extremists one more rallying cry to attack the U.S.
At the time, the government and the American public began a serious national debate over whether the United States should ever torture.
Yet, as Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Diane Feinstein wrote in the report, the days after Sept. 11 were filled with fear that much greater attacks were coming.
She went on to write that the "Intelligence Committee as well often pushes intelligence agencies to act quickly in response to threats and world events."
During the Civil War, for instance, President Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus.
She hopes it will make sure that, even when facing danger, the United States never again abandons its values.
It is no secret that the CIA used torture in its interrogations after Sept. 11, 2001.
He was captured in Pakistan in 2002 and was believed to be a member of al-Qaida, the group behind the Sept. 11 attacks.
He was tortured in Poland at a site the Polish government let the CIA use.
Yet, the Senate report says it did not help gain any significant information from him.
The torture was part of an overreaction to Sept. 11 that included our mistake in invading Afghanistan.
It is all these actions taken together that make us a target for extremists.
Our position in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians does not help.
Even today, we are practically alone in refusing to acknowledge Palestine as its own country.
The U.S. signed the U.N. Convention Against Torture, making torture committed anywhere in the world a crime.
Other nations watch and listen closely to whatever we say or do.
At the time, the government and the American people began a serious national debate over whether the United States should ever torture.
In fact, Feinstein noted that, after Sept. 11, the CIA was encouraged "to do whatever it could to prevent another attack."
Our position in the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians does not help.
Other nations watch and listen to whatever we say or do.
It is these actions that make us a target for extremists.
Our position in the fighting between Israel and the Palestinians does not help.
Now the report has been splashed across TV screens, newspapers and websites.
At the time, the government and the American people began a serious national debate over whether the United States should ever torture.
An obvious situation is if the U.S. faced the immediate threat of an attack that could kill hundreds or thousands of people.
During the Civil War, for instance, President Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus.
But the extremists plot every day to attack America.
That means more militants will give themselves more reasons to launch more attacks against more Americans.
We rely on information from countries in Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere.
Still, the release is not likely to lead to any immediate increased risk to Americans.
It is no secret that the CIA used torture in questioning suspects after Sept. 11, 2001.
What makes people want to harm Americans is the torture itself.
The questioning methods had already been called torture around the world.
Last summer, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the CIA tortured Abu Zubaydah.
Our position in the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians does not help.
We knew then that they kept suspects from sleeping, chained them to walls and threatened them.
But extremist groups plot every day to attack America.
Last summer, the European Court of Human Rights decided that the U.S. tortured Abu Zubaydah.
It is these actions that make us a target for extremists.
Our position in the fighting between Israel and the Palestinians does not help.
They should see how the rest of the world sees us.
Other nations watch and listen to whatever we say or do.
Extremists in some of those countries do as well.
The cluelessness of lawmakers explains why it released the torture report now.
It gives extremists one more reason to attack the U.S. To be clear, the report only gave us a few new details.
In fact, Feinstein pointed out that, after Sept. 11, the CIA was encouraged "to do whatever it could to prevent another attack."
But extremist groups plot every day to attack America.
We need it to prevent attacks.
Horrifying details are in the report.
The torture was part of how we acted after Sept. 11.
Our position in the fighting between Israel and the Palestinians does not help.
The safety of America depends on how we deal with all of our problems around the world, not just this one.

The reality, however, is that the cost of the recycling process almost always outweighs the benefits.
Even the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says it only makes sense economically and environmentally to recycle about 35 percent of our trash.
He wrote, "If you wash plastic in water that was heated by coal-derived electricity, then the net effect of your recycling could be more carbon in the atmosphere."
To reduce emissions by 1 ton you have to recycle 3 tons of glass.
By sending an extra fleet of trucks around town once a week, supporters of recycling actually are not protecting the environment.
> ABOUT THE WRITER William F. Shughart II is the research director of the Independent Institute, 100 Swan Place, Oakland, Calif.
In fact, we produce twice as much waste per person as Western Europe.
It leveled off around 2010, with the average American recycling or composting 34 percent of his waste.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that we recycle 99 percent of lead acid batteries, 67 percent of paper, and 55 percent of aluminum cans.
These fees are proportional to the amount of garbage put out for collection, a so-called pay-as-you-throw system.
Doing that would send exactly the wrong message as cities and businesses across the nation try to build a new commitment to the sustainable use of resources.
Some experts believe that we should start by redesigning factories where possible to prevent or minimize waste in the first place.
Then to the extent possible, we should reuse what is left over, and only then throw out anything that cannot be recycled.
But there are ways to deal with that cost rather than declare it over the top and abandon recycling programs.
Think about what else such fees might do to reduce extra packaging and wasted food.

If it was cheap enough to recycle scrap paper, producers would be beating down your door to buy it.
Also, the EPA says that recycling a ton of plastic saves only about a ton of carbon dioxide.
If recycling saved money, companies would be lined up at your doorstep to buy your trash.
The true recycling test is whether someone will pay you to sort and save your trash.
We Americans use a lot and waste a lot.
Then we should reuse what is left over, and only then throw out what cannot be recycled.
No one argues that the cost of recycling is not important.
We could follow the lead of cities like Seattle by putting a price on trash.
> ABOUT THE WRITER: Michael Kraft is a retired political science and public and environmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.
If it was cheaper to recycle scrap paper, they would be beating down your door to buy it.
Some people see matters differently.
The truth, however, is that the cost of the recycling process almost always outweighs the benefits.
Carbon dioxide, a gas, is produced during the recycling process and can lead to climate change.
Including the cost of collecting old glass from neighborhoods, and the pollution produced by the collection trucks and the recycling process itself, glass recycling creates more emissions.
In fact, we make twice as much garbage per person as Western Europe.
Then we should reuse what is left over, and only then throw out what cannot be recycled.
If people have to pay more, they will find ways to reduce the amount of trash they throw out.
Plastic is another problem.
If it was cheaper to recycle scrap paper, they would be beating down your door to buy it.
Because people feel strongly about "reduce, reuse, recycle."
If recycling saved money, companies would be lined up to buy your trash.
People began recycling much more after the mid-1980s.
They do not want to give money to help city recycling programs and say the cities should end their programs or pay for the cost themselves.
It will also get people to change what they use and throw out.
They argue that recycling costs too much money.

[Malala Yousafzai](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Malala), the Pakistani teen who survived a Taliban assassination attempt in 2012, celebrated her 17th birthday this Monday.
Girls, she said, should not be forced to marry or to leave school to become brides "when they should be girls," or to give birth to children "when they themselves are children."
Gunmen destroyed most of the bridge on the road between Maiduguri and Biu on Saturday night, making it impossible for vehicles to cross.
Following the meeting, she told reporters that the president "promised me that the girls will be returned as soon as possible."
When the activists tried to march peacefully to the presidential residence in May, they were blocked by soldiers and police.
On Monday, the president told Malala that criticism that his government is not doing enough "is very wrong and misplaced."
"Nigerians are saying \'Bring Back Our Girls,\' and we are telling Jonathan to bring back our arrested warriors, our army," he said in the video.

The Nazi soldiers made their orders very clear: Jewish American prisoners of war (POWs) were to be separated from other soldiers and sent to an uncertain fate.
As a noncommissioned officer held in the German POW camp, he ordered more than 1,000 Americans captives to step forward with him and brazenly pronounced, "We are all Jews here."
"Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds seemed like an ordinary American soldier, but he had an extraordinary sense of responsibility and dedication to his fellow human beings," said Avner Shalev.
As it happened, Nixon purchased his home from Lester Tanner, a prominent New York lawyer who mentioned how Edmonds had saved him and dozens of other Jews during the war.
With all the camp\'s inmates defiantly standing in front of their barracks, the German commander turned to Edmonds and said, "They cannot all be Jews."
And then Edmonds said, "If you are going to shoot, you are going to have to shoot all of us because we know who you are and you\'ll be tried for war crimes when we win this war," recalled Chris Edmonds.
The most famous of them were Oskar Schindler, whose efforts to save more than 1,000 Jews were documented in Steven Spielberg\'s 1993 film "Schindler\'s List," and Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who is credited with having saved at least 20,000 Jews before mysteriously disappearing.
But prior to Edmonds, only four of the Righteous were Americans, and they belonged to the clergy or volunteered for rescue groups.
The Nazi soldiers made their orders very clear: Jewish American prisoners of war (POWs) were to identify themselves and then be sent away.
He would not waver, even with a pistol to his head, and the Germans eventually backed down.
Edmonds was captured with thousands of others in the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944, and then spent 100 days in a POW camp.
About 6 million European Jews were killed by German Nazis and their helpers during World War II.
"When he tells the German, \'No,\' that is something that can kill him," she explained.

Until 2012, for example, no cities in China were allowed to publicly disclose the level of PM2.5, the tiny particles that cause the most damage to human lungs, Ma said.
The country also will increase its imports of natural gas and expand its use of solar and wind power over the next couple of decades, officials say.
Many of those moves run up against powerful interests.

A decade ago, the United States would have routinely tried to deport the unaccompanied children, arguing they were violating U.S. immigration laws.
Sponsors ideally are families, but also included are licensed programs willing to accept legal custody of a child, such as shelters for homeless youths.
ORR also is not required to do background checks or a "home study" that includes home visits for every sponsor.

That\'s what I thought libraries were for," said Yakob, an 18-year-old who lives in Minneapolis.
Librarians have learned to search for information online, offering help with everything from basic computer skills to Facebook and LinkedIn.
Eighty percent of library-goers said that borrowing books was "very important."
They usually end up with a little bit more," Anoka County library services assistant Andrea Egbert said of the many tech-related questions that people bring to her.
Some walk in with new e-readers, still in the box, unsure how to switch them on.
In some cases, technological advances mean less face-to-face contact at the library.
The Ramsey County, Minn., library system bought a MakerBot 3-D printer two years ago, mainly for teen programs.

Flo is a highly trained war dog.
Now she does not get any assistance from the military.
Witt says the two dogs he worked with in the Vietnam War saved his life.
Half of the dogs were given to the South Vietnamese army, while the others were put to sleep.
In 1992, President Bill Clinton signed a law that made sure that all military dogs would be treated like true veterans.
Still, the dogs are not given health care once they are retired.
At the training camp, one of the dog trainers came up to him and said, "Oh, you have a really special dog."
While Flo and Crangle were in Afghanistan, they always walked at the front of foot patrols.
He adopted Flo and drove to Chicago to pick her up at the airport.
Of all the effects of war on Afghanistan, among the most unusual \u2014 and perhaps the happiest \u2014 is swan boats.
On a recent day, nearly 40 of the bird-shaped pedal boats packed with families were cruising around the blue mineral waters of the main lake here.
They lack places almost everywhere else in the country to simply get outside and enjoy life without worrying about bombs, firefights or oppressive conservative males.
Like much of what people do in Afghanistan, a visit to Band-e Amir often is interweaved with religion.
Ali is said to have created the lakes through various amazing feats, including a slash of his sword, and damming the resulting valley with cheese.
The Afghan government supports nearly all the operations related to the park, and the Ministry of Agriculture just approved eight new jobs for people to clean the park.
The swan boats, which the Afghans insisted on having, generate income for families in 15 area villages.
In high season, locals rent out rooms in their homes.
A ranger station, a training center and a reception center are under construction.
There are tentative plans for an international airport close to the park, but the potential for international tourism, at least while the war continues, is murky at best.
From several came one of the rarest public sounds in Afghanistan: women laughing.
For centuries Afghans have believed that the waters of the group of six lakes known as Band-e Amir can cure illness.
Two watermelons bobbed in the frigid waters of the lake a few feet away, cooling down.

SHINGTON -- U.S. shoppers who buy hardwood floors and furniture should check to see if its made from Russian timber.
The oak drops acorns that are eaten by deer and wild boar.
"U.S. consumers can be part of this without knowing it," said Linda Walker.
"There is no expert in the world who can tell from looking at the wood that this is a different species," said Nikolay Shmatkov.
From 2004 to 2011, oak timber exports from Russia to China were two to four times too high.
The changes mean that U.S. companies now have to also follow the laws in the exporting countries.
They are also on the hook for wrongdoing by suppliers or middlemen.
Gibson and the government made a deal to avoid prosecution in August.
That is the easiest way to ensure that they are not adding to the destruction of the Russian Far East\'s last tiger habitat," the WWF report said.
Environmental groups think that there are only about 450 Amur tigers left in the wild.
The issue could turn into a trade problem with Russia.
It is not enough to know that the wood is coming from China.

In the new use of social media as activism, few hashtags have generated as much buzz as "#iftheygunnedmedown," which has been circulating around Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
The trending hashtag was several hours old before Alexis Nwaiwu, a 19-year-old sophomore at Georgia State University, decided to post.
His death has not only sparked unrest in Ferguson, but social media have also exploded, picking up his cause.
"The assumption is that black males are predators and because of that perceived threat as a predator, you can do anything to them," said David Wall Rice, a professor at Morehouse College.
Since the hashtag campaign started, the phrase "#iftheygunnedmedown" has been used on Twitter more than 158,000 times, according to The New York Times.
Eric Deggans, television critic for National Public Radio, said the use of social media, particularly among African-Americans, has given voice to people who might have otherwise been silenced.
It ignores "the complexity of the wholeness of who black men are \u2014 it should not be a question of which one, but rather showing the whole person."
Tarshia Stanley, chairwoman of the Spelman College English Department, said that while she agrees that the hashtag campaign has been positive, she cautions about it ultimately being reduced to just a slogan.
"We have to, as a community, think about these issues of safety and violence toward young black men," Stanley said.
After the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by police in Ferguson, Missouri, several media outlets used an image of him taken from his Twitter account.
The trending hashtag was several hours old before Alexis Nwaiwu, a 19-year-old at Georgia State University, decided to post.
The headline read: "Police: Michael Brown Struggled With Officer Before Shooting."
Nwaiwu, a cheerleader at GSU, also has taken up his cause, posting a picture of herself laughing at a party flashing two peace signs.

"You can ask what Michael Brown was doing wrong, instead of what was the person with the gun doing wrong?"
Eric Deggans, television critic for National Public Radio, said the use of social media, particularly among African-Americans, has given a voice to people who might otherwise have been silenced.

Sherpas at base camp said their walkout was for a variety of reasons, including to honor their dead friends.
"There are a lot of Sherpas leaving this morning, and in the next two days there will be a huge number that will follow," said Marzec, who has decided to abandon his climb.
The disaster has restarted a debate over the tremendous risks the Sherpas take on Everest, where most climbers are wealthy amateurs with little or no experience at high altitudes.
At times, they are also tied directly to weak climbers to pull them up the mountain.
"It was crowd behavior \u2014 some (troublemakers) were creating problems, but things are getting back to normal," said Sushil Ghimire.
"There are a lot of Sherpas leaving this morning, and in the next two days there will be a huge number that will follow," said Marzec.
He decided to abandon his climb.
Tusli Gurung, a guide at base camp, estimated that nearly half the Sherpas had left.
Family members of the dead Sherpas said they are angry at the government.
We have no idea how we are going to support the family," said 17-year-old Phinjum.
Dozens of Sherpa guides packed up their tents and left the Mount Everest base camp Wednesday.
Sherpas at base camp said their walkout was for different reasons, including to honor their dead friends.
If the expeditions cancel, many climbers will have to give up most or all of the money they have spent to go up the mountain.

A rapidly mutating virus has spread from plants to bees, and is contributing to the collapse of honeybee colonies vital to the agricultural industry, according to a study published online Tuesday in the journal mBio.
The discovery is the first report of honeybees becoming infected by a virus transmitted by pollen that spread systematically through bees and hives.
Traces of the virus were detected in every part of the bee examined, except its eyes.
Commercially cultivated bees pollinate about 90 crops worldwide, a business valued at $14 billion annually.
That they can adds a complex layer to the forces driving colony collapse, scientists warned.
"They have a high mutation rate," said Yan Ping Chen, a bee pathologist and lead author of the study.
But we do have evidence that TRSV, along with other viruses that we screen on a regular basis, are associated with lower rates of over-winter survival."
Indeed, the new virus, along with the Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus, was linked with colonies considered "weak" due to a variety of stresses.
Activists have raised concern about a type of pesticide known as neonicotinoids, which have been banned in Europe.
Another study found 35 pesticides and fungicides, some at fatal levels, in the pollen collected from bees servicing major food crops.

Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) is a pathogen \u2014 that is, a disease-causing microorganism.
Pollination is the process by which pollen is transported from the male to the female parts of plants.
Just how big a role the virus has been playing in the death of colonies is unknown.
It is also unknown whether the infected bees can spread the virus to healthy plants.

This led scientists to conclude that they helped spread the virus within the colony.
"I\'d be hesitant to proclaim that this virus is the cause of colony collapse," said scientist Randy Oliver.

It is spread by pollen and is known to damage soy crops.
Pollination is the process by which pollen is carried from the male to the female parts of plants.
It would be difficult, Chen said, to separate it from other things threatening the health of bee colonies.
But there is evidence that TRSV is linked to lower rates of bees surviving through the winter.
And infection rates rose to a 22.5 percent high in winter, the study found.
A study last year linked them with the spread of viruses in bees.
Another study found 35 pesticides and fungicides in the pollen collected from bees.
Last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency issued a report together that listed the major causes of colony collapse: pesticides, pathogens, and inadequate nutrition.

They point to studies that show repeated exposure to fruits and vegetables eventually leads children to eat more of them.
That, in turn, will help prevent [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) and related health problems, says William J. McCarthy, a UCLA professor of health policy and management.
She co-wrote a study, which found that students in four Boston schools ate more fruits and vegetables after the new rules took effect \u2014 although they still threw away much of them.
Rewards such as raffle tickets and small amounts of money got students to eat more produce with far less waste than set servings.

The money, Binkle says, would be far better spent on higher quality food, such as strawberries or watermelons.
For Binkle and many other school food managers, the hardest change is that schools must offer both a fruit and vegetable.
The extra food costs school districts $5.4 million a day.

Later this year, the Supreme Court of the United States will decide whether states should be allowed to ban gay marriage.
Granade, a federal judge for the Southern District of Alabama, called the state ban unconstitutional.
Then, there were those judges who tried to stand in the middle, or perhaps just stall for time, as best they could.
"Right now we\'re not going to do it," Judge Jerry Powell said.
Susan Watson of the American Civil Liberties Union said judges risk lawsuits for refusing to issue the licenses.
Without the delay, "there will likely be more confusion in the coming months" before the federal court makes its final decision about the legality of same-sex marriage.

New research suggests that diet soft drinks may actually contribute to weight gain.
Last year, Diet Coke ranked third and Diet Pepsi was seventh in U.S. carbonated soft-drink sales.
There have been safety controversies around the use of a number of artificial sweeteners for decades, especially NutraSweet and saccharin.
For example, a two-year study of 164 children found that overweight kids drank more diet sodas than normal-weight children.
A 2010 review of previous studies concluded that "artificial sweeteners may contribute to weight gain."
However, it points to evidence that "industry-funded studies" are "less trustworthy than those funded independently."
The petition to the FDA could bring the agency back to the days of bigger controversies: its decisions in the early 1980s to approve the use of aspartame, first as an added ingredient in food and then in diet soft drinks.
There have been several research studies and books that link aspartame to health problems.
Recent research suggests that diet soft drinks may actually cause weight gain.
Diet sodas are supposed to help people lose weight.

Alice Finch\'s sculpture of Hogwarts Castle, inspired by the "Harry Potter" books by J.K. Rowling, is huge.
It  is elaborately detailed, with multicolored bottles in the Potions classroom, mossy leaves bursting out of pots in the greenhouse and tiny framed art along the grand staircase.
Finch is a former middle-school teacher who lives with her family on Mercer Island, in Washington state.
The result, so colorful and lush that it seems to have naturally sprung up from the earth, was also a prizewinner.
Her studio holds, she thinks, about 2 million bricks, all carefully sorted by color and size.
The group has about 150 members, many of whom specialize in such areas as castles, space travel or robotics.
She hopes that her visibility as a Lego master will inspire more girls to get creative with the bricks.
When she first showed the Hogwarts build, she said, "people were confused and surprised that a woman had done this."
Going public with her work, in the film and in public events like BrickCon, was not her original plan.
"It\'s a creative process that I enjoy doing \u2026 not something I do for recognition," she says.
Still, her favorite Lego buddies are her two sons, Thorin, 11, and Hadrian, 7.
She and Thorin recently worked together on a colorful "How to Train Your Dragon"-inspired build, and Hadrian, as a 5-year-old, left his mark on Rivendell.

The nation\'s first black U.S. Attorney General urged NAACP members convening in Orlando on Tuesday to help overturn stand-your-ground laws that "senselessly expand the concept of self-defense."
Holder also said his office is examining all available evidence before deciding whether to pursue charges against neighborhood watchman Zimmerman in the shooting death of the black teen.
He told NAACP members to peacefully confront "the unfortunate stereotypes" that sometimes lead to police suspicion and private misjudgment.
Holder praised the peaceful reaction to Saturday\'s acquittal of Zimmerman and the "dignity" of Martin\'s parents.
Barriers based on race persist, despite other progress, Holder said.
They were to be joined by Martin Luther King III and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., according to Derek Turner, NAACP director of communications.
The Trayvon Martin shooting case and verdict, as well as voting rights, were among the topics to be discussed.
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the nation\'s first black to hold that post, urged NAACP members on Tuesday to help overturn stand-your-ground laws that "senselessly expand the concept of self-defense."
The law was expected to be at the center of the second-degree-murder trial of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

Meanwhile, the problem-solving power of a supercomputer in Reston, Va. nicknamed "Tide" and a backup in Orlando named "Gyre" has been more than doubled, from 90 trillion to 213 trillion calculations per second.
The combination of HWRF and Tide alone should significantly sharpen forecasts, Franklin said.
Better forecasts are vital because forecasters still are unable to anticipate when a system might rapidly bulk up.
The Center has steadily honed its track forecasts so that five-day projections are as accurate as three-day forecasts were in 2000.
The upgraded HWRF and supercomputer should also help improve other types of predictions, from excessive heat warnings in South Florida to blizzards in North Dakota, NOAA officials said.
The forecasting improvements were spurred by Superstorm Sandy, which devastated the U.S. East Coast last October.
Congress allotted $24.3 million after that storm as part of a disaster relief bill.
"This is historic in terms of capacity increase," said Louis Uccellini.
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) hopes to improve tropical predictions up to 15 percent this season.
"If you don\'t have the structure of the storm right, it\'s hard to tell how it will interact with its environment," said James Franklin.
The combination of HWRF and Tide alone should significantly sharpen strength forecasts, Franklin said.
Then the HWRF should be able to determine how much thunderstorm activity is around the core and whether a system might weaken or burst with strength, Franklin said.
But the combination of HWRF and the supercomputer should improve path forecasts between 5 and 15 percent this year, Franklin said.
Hurricanes may not take so many people by surprise this season.

While you could do that with any recording, this one is even closer."
The network is expected to grow this year to 50 universities and 40 to 50 audition sites.
At age 13, he sent a recording from a Disklavier in Moscow to audition for an international music competition based in Minnesota.
But, it has been wired with extremely precise sensors to measure the movement of its mechanical parts.
And, aside from the classroom teaching benefits, universities wonder if remote auditions will bring them students from all over.
"If somebody in China wanted to audition for St. Olaf, we could arrange for them to do the audition electronically, which would be much more cost-effective for the student," said Kent McWilliams, a St. Olaf music professor.
Initially, it will be used to receive audition recordings for the 2015 International e-Piano Junior Competition to be held at UM.
The experience brought him there to study.

"We\'ve got these nice little high school formulas that work in a lot of basic cases," Weymouth said.
"We\'re trying to simplify it down to the smallest physical system we can really reasonably measure\u2014that\'s one atom against another," he said.
The researchers slid a tiny tip made of tungsten metal and coated with a thin layer of silicon against a surface of pure silicon crystal coated with hydrogen.
The researchers found that the amount of friction depended strongly on whether the tip was dragged along the direction in which the pairs were oriented, or against it.
"Experimentally this has not been done before," Weymouth said.
Beyond adding to the overall picture of how friction works on a basic level, the research could help to improve the efficiency of machines that lose energy to friction.
A better understanding of friction will benefit applications ranging from the study of geological faults that cause earthquakes to the prediction of wear in automobile parts and other machine parts, they said.
While this basic description generally holds true, many facts about friction remain mysterious.
"But we\'re very bad at taking two surfaces and saying what the friction will be."
This understanding will help with everything from the study of geological faults that cause earthquakes, to the prediction of wear in automobile parts and other machine parts, they said.
Friction is part of our everyday lives.
Friction is what slows things down when they slide against each other.
"It\'s easier to pet a cat in one direction than another," Weymouth said.
Friction is the force working against the moving of one object against another.
The tiny bumps on one surface drag and catch those on a surface being slid across it.
Crystals are a solid material whose atoms are arranged in a very organized pattern.

For Smith, the decision to sign with Capitol for his debut album came down to one thing: passion.
"There was such a warmth, a passion and a respect for what I did," he said.
When Steve Barnett became the boss at Capitol Records, the first thing he did was clean out the offices.
"There was such a warmth, a passion and a respect for what I did," Smith said.
The historic record label, Capitol Records, hired a new boss in 2012.
Steve Barnett was put in charge of Capitol Records in 2012.
Sam Smith and Bastille, a British pop band also on the Capitol label, were nominated for Grammys as best new artist.
Smith got six nominations for his debut album, including the rare feat for a new artist, being nominated in the top four awards: best record, album, song and new artist.
It did not invest on developing new artists and did not deal well with the changes.
The first step was to hire the right leader, Grainge said.
When he was running Columbia Records, the label introduced artists including British soul singer Adele, the boy band One Direction and the indie-rock group Foster the People.
He offered empty offices to other Universal Music labels including Motown.
Barnett said he felt safe betting on Sam Smith.
That hunch has paid off.
He told The Times that he only saw that passion when he sang for Nick Raphael, the head of Capitol in England.
"There was such a warmth, a passion and a respect for what I did," Smith said.
Grainge and Barnett would not say how much the new owners have spent on Capitol.
Grainge said the changes are not part of some big business shakeup.
In 2014, Capitol hired two of the biggest new artists of the year: singer Sam Smith and the boy band 5 Seconds of Summer.
Smith got six nominations for his first album, including the rare accomplishment of a new artist being nominated in the top four awards: best record, album, song and new artist.
Capitol had been hurt by changes in the music business in the last decade.
Fans went from buying CDs to downloading songs and albums, then to streaming music online.
Barnett had been a manager for rock group AC/DC, Cyndi Lauper and other musicians.
His hunch paid off.
Katy Perry\'s album "Prism" also did very well for Capitol.
The historic record label, Capitol Records, hired a new boss in 2012.
It has recorded albums for music stars including the Beatles, Beach Boys and Frank Sinatra.
Before he became chairman of Capitol Records Group, Barnett was president of Columbia Records.
The first step was to hire the right leader, said Grainge.
When he was running Columbia Records, he worked with artists like the British soul singer Adele, the boy band One Direction and the indie-rock group Foster the People.
Barnett also decided to restore the Capitol Tower, a historic building in Los Angeles where the label got started.
Universal Music wanted to nurture Capitol back to success by helping its people.

Weather researchers at the University of Oklahoma are building sensors and advising OSU researchers on data collection.
"We have the (unmanned aircraft) expertise, we have the weather expertise and, by golly, we have the weather," said Stephen McKeever, an Oklahoma government and university official.
"In many senses, we\'re the perfect laboratory to do this kind of thing."
The small aircraft weigh up to 55 pounds and can cost from $10,000 to $100,000, depending on the types of technology involved.
Sensors would collect data on temperature, humidity and pressure while intercepting a storm.
"If you live in Oklahoma, you have an interest in tornadoes," he said.
One team had scheduled a test flight for an aircraft built for a government public safety drone program May 20.
The aircraft also can be used to help fight wildfires, dust agricultural crops and inspect pipes.
Quiet ones can help locate survivors in the aftermath of a disaster.
"We\'re really excited actually about how our technology can be re-deployed from border patrol into flying into storms to gather and collect data that can really save a lot of people\'s lives," said Jacob Stockton, a graduate student at Oklahoma State.
The committee met May 31, hours before the El Reno storm hit the Oklahoma City area.
Under current Federal Aviation Administration rules, it is illegal to operate unmanned aircraft in the national airspace.
For the first step, the FAA is preparing to set up six test sites around the U.S. for the research and development of unmanned aircraft.
An advance warning for a tornado means minutes, not hours.
Researchers also plan to improve forecasting by monitoring the atmosphere before and after storms form.
His focus has shifted to twisters and the questions still puzzling scientists: how, why and when tornadoes form.
They delayed the flight by two days and successfully launched the plane into clear skies.
The government is preparing to set up six test sites around the nation for the research and development of unmanned aircraft.

The aircraft also can be used to help fight wildfires, protect crops and inspect pipes.
The technology is also safer than storm chasing when it comes to confirming there is a tornado.
The government also says that the pilot must keep the aircraft in his or her sight at all times.
Most of the work on drones has been for the military or for spying.
You only get a very short warning when there is a tornado coming.
To do this, they want send airplanes with no pilots into a growing storm.
But researchers want to use them in science.
Nineteen tornadoes hit the state in the last two weeks of May alone.
Teachers and students at Oklahoma State University are building special aircraft to survive high winds.
Oklahoma State professor Jamey Jacob used to work with drones to explore Mars in the 1980s.
The committee met on May 31 just hours before the storm hit the Oklahoma City area.
They knew they could gather good information if only they could get the drones in the air.
But then the government makes them wait 48 hours before the aircraft actually goes up.
Now they want to warn people hours ahead of time.
They want to send airplanes with no pilots into a storm.
Some groups can ask for special permission.
Soon it shot into the sky, soaring thousands of feet, carrying sophisticated radio gear, processors and solar panels.
"This is a great, big, hard problem," said Richard DeVaul, a Google engineer and chief technical architect for the company\'s Project Loon.
Now DeVaul and other engineers on the project say a global network of low-cost, high-altitude balloons could carry enough wireless equipment to beam Internet connections to remote parts of Africa, Asia and other developing regions.
Google has been working on Loon for nearly two years, but it only recently went public with the idea.
The project calls for a fleet of hundreds or even thousands of balloons that will float twice as high as most jetliners fly, in a circle around the Earth.
But while it sounds simple, the logistics are mind-boggling.
Another provided a phone number to call.
The giant plastic envelope shimmered and shook in the breeze like some airborne jellyfish rising through a gentle current.
Now DeVaul says a global network of low-cost, high-altitude balloons could carry enough wireless equipment to beam Internet connections to remote parts of Africa, Asia and other developing regions.
They watched the action and relayed questions to Ponda and another Loon project staffer, Paul Acosta.
The idea calls for a fleet of hundreds or even thousands of balloons that will float twice as high as most jetliners fly, in a circle around the Earth.
The larger models can be 45 feet in diameter and were designed by Google with separate chambers for helium and air.
Fortunately, he added, "at Google we\'ve got a bunch of really clever computer scientists and a lot of computing power."
Google recently sent a giant, plastic helium balloon into the air.

Now DeVaul says a global network of low-cost, high-altitude balloons could carry enough wireless equipment to beam Internet connections to remote parts of Africa, Asia and other developing regions.
The goal is to work out the answers to a number of technical questions that must be resolved to make the project work.
Those are ideas that seem off the wall, but could make a huge impact.
The idea calls for a fleet of hundreds or even thousands of balloons that will float twice as high as most jetliners fly, in a circle around the Earth.
Soon after the ballon was aloft, project launch commander Bill Rogers and other members of his crew loaded their trucks to track its radio signal.

The goal is to work out the answers to a bunch of questions to make the project work.
The idea calls for hundreds or even thousands of balloons that will float twice as high as most jetliners fly, in a circle around the Earth.
So Google engineers came up with a system to raise or lower them in order to catch the air currents needed to keep them floating just the right distance from each other.
They also need to stay in line so if one floats out of range from Internet users, another will come along and take its place.
Project launch commander Bill Rogers and other members of his crew loaded their trucks to track its radio signal.

Standing atop a rocky ridge near his base camp at dawn, Scott Richardson looks over an ancient wilderness.
"This is dinosaur country," he says, gesturing toward the valley.
The 58-year-old Arizona native is dressed in a wide-brimmed hat and white clothes to stay safe from the sun.
He pieces together pieces of bone in a lab \u2014 puzzles with no images to guide him.
For 12 years, he has bushwhacked across southern Utah, scouting out traces of the distant past.
There were also crocodiles that swam and chased prey on land, and 2-foot-tall creatures with razor claws that ran in deadly packs like velociraptors.
He approached a paleontology team nearby and asked the experts to look at his find.
The creature, labeled "the horniest dinosaur," had a record-breaking 15 horns jutting from its skull.
Scott Richardson stood atop a ridgeline near his base camp at dawn.
"These were colossal creatures that ruled the planet for millions of years," Richardson says.
It contains bones from the Cretaceous period, which lasted from 144 million to 65 million years ago.
Scientists in the last decade have dug up as many as 20 new dinosaur species.
He found a member of the armored ankylosaur family; a Lythronax, which is an ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex; and an unknown species of a duck-billed dinosaur.
"Scott is persistent; he\'s spent more time out there than almost anyone," says Mike Getty, a paleontologist at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
Just after a hard rain, Richardson spied bones in the dirt while hiking along a narrow ridgeline a few miles north of his current campsite.
About 144 million years ago, desert-like Utah was a green forest.
His friends then began calling him "Scottosaurus."

The University of Pennsylvania is at the forefront of a movement to experiment with free open online courses, but its own researchers are finding out that the results of the undertaking are mixed.
But Ed Rock, who heads Penn\'s MOOC program, called the findings "entirely unsurprising and not at all troubling.
"I think there is something there," she said, "but we need to understand better what that contribution is."
The University of Pennsylvania is at the leading edge of a movement to experiment with free open online courses.
The University of Pennsylvania is at the leading edge of a movement to experiment with free open online courses.
Yet, very few of their viewers \u2014 4 percent on average \u2014 actually complete the courses, according to the new Penn study.
The results come on the heels of another Penn study, released last month, that showed a vast majority of students enrolled in MOOCs already hold college degrees.
Among the classes were ones on calculus, Greek and Roman mythology, and the science of drugs.
The classes were taught by Penn professors and offered in partnership with an online education company.
The nation recently focused its attention on the 10-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.
The gray swan storms were generated by a computer model that "coupled" together a hurricane model with a global climate model.
"When you do hundreds and hundreds of thousands of events, you\'re going to see hurricanes that are unlike anything you\'ve seen in history," said Emanuel.
Check out any good map that shows the water depth around the Florida peninsula.
Also, surges can get bigger by being funneled into bays," Emanuel said.
Then they simulated 3,100 each for three time periods (2006 through 2036, 2037 through 2067, and 2068 through 2098).
Granted, the study said that these "gray swans" are exceedingly unlikely \u2014 less than 1 in 10,000 years for the 19-foot surge in the current climate.
Still, you could make the case that a study like this helps us think a lot better about what risk is all about.
"It\'s not likely, but it\'s not impossible," he said.
These theoretical storms are also highly unlikely to occur.
In 1848, another storm produced a surge of 4.6 meters, or about 15 feet.
The city of Tampa may be far from the barrier islands that get battered by the waves from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is more exposed than it seems.
The researchers looked at 2,100 possible Tampa Bay hurricanes in the current climate.
Moreover, in a late 21st century climate with bad global warming, the worst-case scenario followed a very different path.
That storm could cause a surge of nearly 11.1 meters, or nearly 37 feet.
Still, the study also showed that global warming makes the worst possible surges more likely.
The study also shows that for Cairns, Australia, a 5.7-meter, or 18-foot, storm surge is possible in the current climate.

Most U.S. colleges and universities have exchange programs, which offer the chance to study at another school elsewhere in the world for a year or semester.
This was one reason for visits to Mexico Wednesday by both Secretary of State John Kerry and Janet Napolitano, the former Department of Homeland Security secretary.
Napolitano now heads the University of California (UC) system.
Among them, is that Mexico is dangerous and the United States is unfriendly to Mexicans.
But the numbers have dropped with the spike in drug violence, especially during the presidency of Felipe Calderon, who left office in 2012.
That dropped more than 50 percent to 3,815 by the 2011-2012 school year.
Young Americans wanting to study in Latin America have stopped looking to Mexico.
Justin Bogda, 21, took a summer job at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City in 2013 while studying at the University of Southern California.

The boom of seismic cannons will soon sound under the Atlantic Ocean as companies look for oil and gas.
"I just can\'t understand how anybody would propose something that\'s going to be ... endangering whales and dolphins and turtles and fish," Edwards said.
"It\'s been pretty well documented that seismic surveys have disrupted animal behavior and animal communication," said Danielle Cholewiak, a government researcher who studies sound.
Species of large Atlantic whales operate at low frequencies and will hear the booms.
"If there\'s a survey in Virginia you\'re going to hear it in southern North Carolina, easily," Nowacek said.
"I just can\'t understand how anybody would propose something that\'s going to be ... endangering whales and dolphins and turtles and fish," he said.

Energy companies will soon start looking for oil and gas off the East Coast of the United States.
It will start as early as next spring.
Government officials and the oil and gas industry say the exploration is harmless.
"I just can\'t understand how anybody would propose something that\'s going to be ... endangering whales and dolphins and turtles and fish," he said.
The seismic surveys are done with air guns.
They blast out sound waves every 10 seconds or so for weeks at a time.
The 3-D maps help companies figure out if there is likely to be any oil and gas in the rock formations.
Yet even government scientists are worried about what the extreme sound can do to the hearing and communication of whales and other marine life.
Many marine animals use sound to find food and mates, and to keep track of their young.
"It\'s been pretty well documented that seismic surveys have disrupted animal behavior and animal communication," said Danielle Cholewiak, a government scientist.
Political leaders in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia pushed President Barack Obama to approve the seismic testing.
They hope that Obama will allow offshore drilling that will bring in jobs and money.
Science and years of experience prove that there is no danger to marine animal populations, it added.
He said there has been far too little information collected on the effects of the seismic cannons.
Energy companies will soon start looking for oil and gas off the East Coast of the United States.

In response, Disney says it is unveiling a raft of new merchandise that puts more of Rey front and center \u2014 including toys featuring her gripping a blue lightsaber.
The company wanted to avoid giving away a key plot point where Rey picks up the lightsaber wielded by Finn in order to duel new baddie Kylo Ren.
"The fact that she was the ultimate heroine of the film was one of the significant plot points we did want to protect," Southern said.

The Romans believed Jupiter was the king of the gods who killed a race of giants.
Jupiter, the largest planet, helped form the solar system many millions of years ago.
It pushed out the pieces left over when the sun and other planets were formed.
Some pieces may have landed on Earth and brought the water the planet needed to develop life.
But those planets do not have an atmosphere like ours that can support human life.
He is a scientist who also worked on the study.
Large, cold planets with atmospheres made of gases, called gas giants, would form away from the sun.
Scientists thought all planets stayed in the same orbit around the sun after they formed.
They noticed all planets did not go around in even circles around their sun, like our solar system.
One theory says Jupiter moved to where Mars is today.
This explains why those planets formed later and why they have different atmospheres.

Nieves Garcia came from Mexico at age 6 and spent most of her elementary school years in California classified as an "English learner" even after she learned the language.
Earlier this year, Tesha Sengupta-Irving, an education professor, registered her son for kindergarten.
At the time, her parents were visiting and she was speaking to them in their native tongue, Bengali, so she wrote on her survey that Bengali was spoken at home.
Her son, who knew just a few words in Bengali, was tested and classified as an English learner.
She said the results were surprising since she had tirelessly tried to teach him Bengali and he still spoke only English.

SHINGTON - The colorful monarch butterfly is in danger.

That simple civics lesson is the root of the problem.
"In the past, Congress has responded to make sure that the Treasury can still keep borrowing, but debt and budgets have always been contentious," said D. Andrew Austin.
"While the debt limit has never caused the federal government to default on its obligations, it has at times caused great inconvenience and has added uncertainty," Austin wrote.
In 1919, the debt ceiling was about $43 billion, but at the close of the budget year debt actually stood at about $25.5 billion.
By 1945, it was set at $300 billion.
Lawmakers had grown tired of passing spending increases and then voting against raising the debt ceiling for their big spending.
In one example, Sen. Barack Obama spoke on the Senate floor on March 16, 2006, in opposition to raising the debt ceiling while George W. Bush was president.
By this past July, that number had doubled to nearly $1.28 trillion.

But Peter Kelley, a spokesman for the American Wind Energy Association, said that for a wind farm to be permitted under the new rules, "you have to document all of the different ways you\'ll preserve the eagles.
The wind industry argued that was not sufficient for long-term investment in wind power facilities.
Kelley said the new regulations would "increase the protection of eagles and will help develop more wind farms, a leading solution to climate change."
"Renewable energy development is vitally important to our nation\'s future, but it has to be done the right way," she said.
"The changes in this permitting program will help the renewable energy industry and others develop projects that can operate in the longer term."
Hutchins, however, said a recent study estimated that 573,000 birds and 888,000 bats are killed every year by wind farms.

He says "this ruling sets up a system of permitting that allows, for the first time, the legal killing of bald and golden eagles.
"The Obama administration has called for 20 percent of our energy to be generated by renewables by 2030."
He asked, "If it\'s not done right, what kind of an impact is that going to have on birds and bats?"
Pesticides used on crops softened their eggshells and the birds became endangered, Hutchins said.
New threats include development around areas where eagles nest and, now, wind power.

The incident occurred on Jan. 28 when students trying to buy lunch had their meals thrown away, angering parents and stirring outrage around the country.
Several dozen parents attended the meeting, and some said the report was vague and that the cafeteria worker put on leave was being unfairly blamed, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.
Several threatening phone calls were made to the school following the incident, but police determined they did not represent any real danger, Salt Lake City School District spokesman Jason Olsen said.
The department, he said, "did fail in getting information out effectively."
Orton said meals will never again be taken from kids, parents will be notified of low balances, and students can go into the red for a week and still receive meals.
That question of accountability and responsibility has never been answered, she said.
The district told a cafeteria manager and a district supervisor not to come to work as the investigation got underway last week.
"The lunchroom staff should not be held accountable for the policies implemented by their supervisors," said Lynn Lonardo.
District Superintendent McKell Withers said the leave was meant to protect the two workers from threats.

Scientists began recording average surface temperatures on Earth in 1880.
As water heats up, ice melts, causing sea levels to rise.
"It wasn\'t quite the warmest year in the land records, but combined, this did actually give the warmest year" since 1880.
Last year was the warmest ever despite a colder-than-usual U.S. winter caused by a "polar vortex," the scientific agencies said.
The colder U.S. winter was balanced out by hotter periods elsewhere: blazing heat in the Western U.S., and hot spells in Europe and Australia.

Additionally, adult coaches and referees who spend time with student athletes may look out more for the health of female players than of males.
The number of students playing soccer has risen in recent years.
As the game has become more popular, it has also become more dangerous.
Parents can play their part too.
Heading the ball in soccer can be dangerous.
Perhaps girls have less neck strength than boys, so their brains get more shaken by a bang to the head, Comstock said.
Girls may be more likely to notice a head injury and report it to their coaches.

Now, this capital city seems to be in bloom, as everything from high-art to hurried scrawls spring from overpasses, storefronts and sidewalks.
The splash of color is earning the city praise and recognition in the art world \u2014 even as some here wonder about the line between art and vandalism.

Syria President Bashar al-Assad has one week to reveal what kind of chemical weapons his country has and where they are being kept, under a deal struck Saturday by the United States and Russia.
Under the agreement, inspectors from the international body that monitors compliance with chemical weapons bans would be able to inspect any sites in Syria immediately.
The initial inspections are to be completed in November.
But he warned that "if diplomacy fails, the United States remains prepared to act."
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said an attack was off the table for now.
They said it failed to hold Assad accountable for the deaths of hundreds of civilians killed with poison gas.

Mount Rainier looms large over Puget Sound.
The glacier-covered volcano rises alone near Seattle, beckoning people who love the outdoors.
"There is a draw, but I can\'t explain it," said Len Throop, who has climbed Rainier many times but never reached the top.
The worst accident came in June 1981 when 11 climbers died under giant chunks of ice.
The six climbers who died last week included two experienced mountain guides.
Climbing Rainier requires skill, endurance and special equipment.
Often, they are tied to their climbing mates for safety.
But he said that possible problems climbers face include "rock fall, avalanche, a mixture of everything in between."
"The sad fact (is), sometimes bodies are not recovered."

The developer is building the first major subdivision in decades in the town of Davis, Calif. City officials in Davis insisted on the plan.
The project will feature drought-tolerant landscaping along its bike paths, and most of the front yards will be landscaped with low-water plants in place of grass.
A big unknown is whether buyers will want homes without lawns.
Salesmen went west promoting the new yard plans, Mickey said.
The emerging middle class wanted lawns like the American aristocracy back East and the English gentry before them.
In its yearbook from 1897, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) described the ideal turf.
Most homeowners associations continue to insist that those lawns be maintained, even as the drought became a crisis this year and cities across the region required homeowners to cut water consumption by 20 percent or more.
The program pays homeowners to replace lawns with drought-tolerant plants, up to $1,000 per household.
Seed companies sold the idea from Maine to California, said Thomas J. Mickey, author of "America\'s Romance with the English Garden."
Well-groomed lawns in the front yards of homes became symbols of the wealth of the residents who lived there.
Instead of mowing once a week she prunes a couple of times a year.
"I\'m really happy with it," she said.
California is in the middle of a drought.
"Real estate agents would say, \'Now you can have a lawn.\'"
"We had a line outside the door the morning we started," said Lisa Brown.
The same size area with low-water plants needs only 12,338 gallons of water a year, she said.
Yet, its lush lawns are modeled on those of rain-soaked England, and require regular watering.
Nudged by local governments worried about water shortages, home builders and homeowners associations are showing an increased willingness to accept the drought-tolerant landscapes that more naturally suit California.
"A perfect lawn consists of the growth of a single variety of grass with a smooth, even surface," wrote Frank Lamson-Scribner of the USDA.
Roseville, Calif. launched its own cash-for-grass program in 2008.
"We had a line outside the door the morning we started," said Lisa Brown, who runs Roseville\'s water-conservation program.
It pays people to switch from grass to plants that use less water.

Some lucky ones end up at The Rhino Orphanage, where workers become mothers to the traumatized young ones, feeding, walking and comforting them until they are ready to return to the bush.
They learn to recognize voices, sleep in a stable, feed on a milk substitute, roll in the mud and play with each other and their human caretakers, who try not to get knocked over by these big, rambunctious babies.
"These rhinos would be dead if there weren\'t a place to send them," Gabriela Benavides, a Mexican veterinarian at the orphanage, said.
Benavides spoke at an enclosure where three rhinos named Faith, Lunga and Matthew trotted and slurped water from containers.
They approached visitors behind a low wooden barrier, allowing themselves to be touched and stroked on the rough skin of their heads.
Poachers with machetes hacked another baby rhino more than two dozen times as it stayed near the body of its mother.
It says it has successfully raised and released nine rhinos back into the wild.
Poachers will "go for any little bit" of horn, even from a baby rhino whose horns are emerging, said Dex Kotze, who helps to oversee the orphanage.
On one occasion, poachers were on their way to the orphanage, but their gang had been infiltrated by an undercover agent from the South African government.
International interns who have assisted with the rhinos turned off phone and camera location settings and did not post photographs or video onto social media websites while at the orphanage.
Limited human contact with the rhinos also assists in their return to the wild, which happens when they are 2 or 3 years old.
The rhinos learn to recognize voices, sleep in a stable, eat a milk substitute, roll in the mud and play with each other and their human minders, who try not to get knocked over by these big, active babies.
Managers say only that it is near a golf and safari resort at the Entabeni wildlife park, about a three-hour drive north of Johannesburg.
Benavides said it was rewarding to help rhino orphans, but also stressful because, "you don\'t know what\'s going to happen to them when you finally let them go," she said.

President Barack Obama on Wednesday paid his first visit to the Everglades to deliver an Earth Day speech.
"This is not an effort necessarily to go to anybody\'s home state," White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday.
"The truth is those Republicans that choose to deny the reality of climate change, they do that to the detriment of the people that they\'re elected to represent," Earnest said.
Restoration work is also becoming more critical as the rising seas begin taking a toll on the wetlands.
President Barack Obama spoke about climate change during his first visit to the Florida Everglades Wednesday.
The White House admits that the government has owed the money since before Obama took office.
The United Nations group predicts increases in temperature, sea level and ocean salt.
She said the Everglades could be an example for other places endangered by climate change around the world.

The New Guinea flatworm is not pretty.
"As a biologist I can handle most things, but I find this really revolting," he said.
In his study, Justine said the worm was first reported in the United States in Miami in June 2012.
Because it had been dry, another biologist suggested Sei look for snails at night.
So at about 4 a.m., she headed to a spot in the garden where the day before she had seen empty snail shells.
Robinson was hired as the first national malacologist in 1995, and, since then, he has seen outbreaks of invasive snails threatening wheat crops in Montana, Detroit and Washington state.
The New Guinea flatworm is a small worm.
In his study, Justine said the worm was first reported in the U.S. in Miami in June 2012.
Instead, she discovered a slimy flatworm and snapped a few pictures.
The New Guinea flatworm is a strange animal.
"From Miami, the flatworm can go anywhere in Florida and anywhere in the U.S.," said Jean-Lou Justine.
"In the beginning, we are going to find them mainly in gardens because they will be transported from garden to garden," Justine said.
In his study, Justine said the worm was first reported in the U.S. in Miami in June 2012.
Four months later, another flatworm was seen in the city.
The latest discovery was made by Makiri Sei.
The second goal is more difficult than the first, Millward explained.
"But what are we going to do to support black male teachers who take on these other layers of responsibility?"
Many black teachers and principals lost their jobs.
The organizers of the Black Men Teaching Initiative hope that providing African-American middle and high school students with mentors will create a snowball effect.
Only 2 out of 100 teachers in the United States are black men.
Schools that were once only for white students would also have to enroll black students.

Florida immigration courts are increasingly swamped by children who illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border on their own to escape violence back home.
The speedy procedure stems from a rush of children fleeing violence and poverty in Central America.
Only three of the 25 children who appeared before one Miami judge on a recent Friday afternoon were represented by attorneys, said Lesley Mendoza.
Children are fleeing countries such as Honduras that have descended into lawlessness as drug trafficking escalates and violent gangs attack families, including children.
Florida immigration courts are increasingly swamped by unaccompanied children who illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border to escape violence back home.

President Barack Obama on Thursday approved U.S. military airstrikes against Islamic fighters in northern Iraq.
He vowed not to put American combat troops back on the ground in Iraq and said there was no U.S. military solution to the crisis.
They were escorted by two F/A-18 fighters from an air base in the region.

The president also wants to help defend Americans in the area.
Even so, he explained the Islamic State fighters might attack the city of Irbil.
However, officials said the White House was talking with some lawmakers.
They included the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, and Mitch McConnell.
They have said he does not need an OK from the lawmakers.
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140923_MINWAGE.jpg" />WASHINGTON \u2014 President Barack Obama has wanted an increase in the federal minimum wage for a while, but he\'s not likely to get it anytime soon.
Some advocates hope that victories on the ballot, especially in four Republican strongholds, will change the national economic debate.
"It becomes a lot harder for members of Congress who might not support these kinds of things to continually say \'no\' when it comes up in Washington," said Josh Levin, a vice president at the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center.
Earlier this month, fast-food workers across the country participated in a strike in favor of a $15-per-hour "livable" wage.
Activists must be realistic about what increases they push for at the polls, said Peggy Shorey, the director of state government relations at the AFL-CIO.
Ten states, including Florida and Washington, have minimum wages legally tied to CPI measures, according to the Department of Labor.
Instead, the minimum hourly rates would top off at $8.50 per hour in 2017 in Arkansas.
"Our polls would indicate we have a lot of work to do to educate people on some of our concerns," said Michael Held.
In August, 58 percent of surveyed potential Alaskan voters supported the state initiative there, according to a Democratic polling firm.
Five Southern states \u2014 South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama \u2014 have no state minimum wage at all.

Last year, about 91,000 workers earned the federal minimum wage or less in the four states with November ballot proposals, according to the government.
It would stop at $9 per hour in 2016 in Nebraska.

Sixteen-year-old Audrey Dimitrew recently won a spot on a club volleyball team in Chantilly, Virginia.
In recent years, families have increasingly turned to the courts to resolve youth sports conflicts.
Parents are spending thousands of dollars and giving up countless weekends for kids to participate on travel teams and prestigious high school programs.
Project Play, a group that is trying to get more kids involved in sports, estimates the average travel team parent is spending about $2,300 a year.
Experts say parents want proof that the money they spend is paying off.
The coach told Audrey she was not ready to be a setter on the team and would not play much for the rest of the season, even though she had "college level" skills, the court documents said.
The family was disappointed, perplexed and felt they had not been given what they were promised after a significant investment of money.
A 2014 Project Play poll found around 70 percent of parents thought youth sports were too expensive and time-consuming and placed too much emphasis on winning over having fun.
Fairfax County Judge John Tran said he was "unhappy ... that a child is not given an opportunity to play."
The ruling means that Audrey will likely not play this season, but Susan Dimitrew said the fight will continue.
Sixteen-year-old Audrey Dimitrew recently won a spot on a club volleyball team in Virginia, where she lives.
Parents are spending thousands of dollars and giving up weekends for kids to be on travel teams and play in competitive high school programs.
The problem began after Audrey and about 75 other girls competed for spots on the under-16 Chantilly Juniors in November.
The coach told Audrey she was the best setter at the tryout and would get playing time.
The coach told Audrey she was not ready to be a setter on the team and would not play much for the rest of the season, even though she had college-level skills.
The coach gave Audrey two choices: She could be a practice player for the Juniors or transfer to another team in the league.
Sixteen-year-old Audrey Dimitrew recently won a spot on a club volleyball team in Virginia, where she lives.
She hoped to impress high school coaches and possibly even college coaches.
The league knows Audrey is upset about not getting playing time, but it said if it allows her to switch teams then many other kids would also want to change.
Parents are spending thousands of dollars and giving up weekends for kids to be on travel teams and play in competitive high school programs.
They are not alone.
Parents of top players might spend $20,000 a year or more.
When the season began, Audrey got practice play with her team, but was on the bench for the first two games.
The coach told Audrey she was not ready to be a setter on the team and would not play much for the rest of the season, even though she had college-level skills.

Others say Disney could allow parents to collect return times for several attractions at once, though doing so might invite more abuse.
"Goodness gracious, you can\'t hurt kids with disabilities because you have able-bodied people abusing the system or cheating."
Disney said recently it would stop allowing disabled guests to jump ahead in lines at its U.S. theme parks.
It might seem like a small change to most families.
Parents say there must be a better fix.
Some suggest making families ask for the cards before they arrive in the parks.
"You can\'t hurt kids with disabilities because you have able-bodied people abusing the system or cheating."
Disney said recently it would stop allowing disabled guests to jump ahead in lines at its U.S. theme parks.
Soon after, Disney found that close to a quarter of all the visitors riding Radiator Springs Racers in Cars Land used a guest assistance card.
It says the number of people asking for them has grown "substantially" in the past few years.
Disney released the statement Friday in a letter to groups that help disabled people.
"There has to be some sort of middle ground," said Don La Vette of Joliet, Ill.

Taher, a Palestinian teenager from the West Bank, had never met an Israeli before.
"It makes me feel not strong or not free," said Taher of the conflict between Palestinians and Israel.
Most recently, Israel and the Hamas group that governs Gaza have been in a fierce fight.
To date, more than 400 teenagers from the Middle East have participated in it.
But this is one of the first times the program has taken place when the two sides are actually fighting, said Roy Gordon, who works for the program.
"Most of these young people have never had a conversation with someone on the other side," Gordon said.
Taher is a Palestinian teenager from the West Bank region of the Middle East.
"I can tell them what I can\'t tell them back in the West Bank."
"And I want to have a voice to show to people what Palestine is and what we truly do, who are Palestinians and what we suffer."

The Seattle kids petitioned Washington state last year to adopt stricter science-based regulations to protect them against climate change.
"I don\'t think this litigation is going to be successful because climate change is a global problem, and it\'s not clear what a state could do," Richard Stewart, a law professor at New York University, said.
They claimed that approval of fossil fuel development has violated the fundamental right of citizens to be free from government actions that harm life, liberty and property.
However, it said in a statement that President Barack Obama and the agency have been taking action to "give our kids and grandkids the cleaner, safer future they deserve."

Brian Williams, the anchor of NBC "Nightly News," has been taken off the air for six months.
Specifically, NBC News President Deborah Turness confirmed in the memo that Williams "misrepresented events" in his original report from Iraq.

Ernest Williams, in prison on a 41-month drug sentence, had long stopped asking his family to come see him at the Federal Detention Center Miami.
"I haven\'t seen my girls in months, I could not believe how much they have grown," said Williams, 37, who is in jail on drug charges.
"You are a key to the success of your father," Federal Bureau of Prisons Director Charles E. Samuels Jr. told the 20 girls, aged 4 to 18.
In a third-floor prison meeting space transformed into a ballroom with a fairy-tale theme, 13 fathers in suits and ties and tuxedos spent two hours with their girls.
The father of three daughters has been in prison almost three years for theft and is supposed to leave prison in January.
They arrived in fancy dresses, the littlest ones wearing pastel gowns and patent leather shoes.
It was decorated with purple ribbons, glitter paper chandeliers and a big cardboard cutout carriage \u2014 the handmade gifts of a group of female inmates.
Returning to a strong, engaged family gives them their best shot at starting over.
"You hope this will be transformational, that this dances gives these fathers something to look forward to," said Walter T. Richardson, the Miami-Dade Police Department chaplain.
An hour after the dance, Anthony Martin, 33, a father of two young girls, sat quietly.
One of his daughters was crying, head in her hands.
"She misses me and I love her so much," he said, comforting the 8-year-old.
He added, "I missed my youngest daughter learning to talk.

One thing that is clear is that Wal-Mart and other U.S. retailers will probably have to take on a bigger role in enforcing worker standards, despite the expense.
But on the other hand, they feel that consumers care and want the retailer to assure whatever is sold in their stores meets certain standards."
"When you go down to these places, you basically see what they choose to show you," said Devon Zagory, a produce industry expert.
Monitoring systems that focus on surprise or multiple inspections annually and interviewing workers are among the best ways to get a clearer picture of labor conditions, experts say.
Some growers with good reputations on labor issues say Wal-Mart consistently partners with producers with the lowest prices, regardless of labor conditions.
Such an approach is risky, as more consumers demand that their food be produced in a fair and just manner.
The extra cost is less damaging than being linked to labor abuses, said Emily Miggins, a former manager at Safeway.
Experts said American retailers should work together to reach an agreement on basic worker welfare standards.
It is unclear how much it will cost to create better living conditions for produce workers.

On Friday, the United States said that it was seeking to extradite Snowden -- to legally bring him to the country to face charges.
The _New York Times_ said that Snowden has not been seen publicly, or photographed, since he arrived in Moscow.
He had  expected that the United States would file charges against Snowden.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that Russia should turn Snowden over.
How can Snowden travel without a valid U.S. passport?
Assange told the _New York Times_ that WikiLeaks arranged for Ecuador to give Snowden a "special refugee travel document" a week ago.

When Daniel Promislow jogs with his 11-year-old Weimaraner, named Silver, it is hard for him to see the dog get old.
"Month by month, he gets slower and slower," said Promislow, who studies genetics at the University of Washington (UW).
"We\'re not talking about doubling the healthy life spans of pets," UW molecular biologist Matthew Kaeberlein said.
Large-scale human studies are costly and would take decades to complete.
But with dogs, it could be possible to find out in a few years whether rapamycin is beneficial.
"I think it\'s worth a go, not just from what it can teach us about humans, but for the sake of the animals themselves," said University of Alabama Biology Department Chairman Steven Austad, an expert on aging.
Rapamycin works partly by shutting off a protein that promotes cell growth, Kaeberlein explained.
As a result, cells grow more slowly, which slows the spread of cancer.
Effects on the heart are among the first things the researchers hope to track in dogs, Promislow said.
The researchers eventually hope to persuade hundreds of dog owners to enroll their pets in a much larger experiment.
The goal would be to study the normal aging process of dogs, as well as to look at the long-term effects of rapamycin and how it works in dogs.
So, the UW team is looking for unconventional sources of money.
The UW project sounds well-thought-out, said Dr. Jeffrey Halter, director of the University of Michigan Geriatrics Center.

At once shocking and all too familiar, their story of bombings, executions and refugee camps before finding a safe haven in Chicago is just one of thousands coming out of the crisis in Syria, the Middle East and Europe.
As European leaders scramble to find a solution to the flood of migrants fleeing Syria, the U.S. response also has been closely watched.
Placements are generally prioritized based on need, with torture victims, medical cases and safety in the country of asylum ranking high.
The woman, whose husband was fatally shot by a sniper, fled the ruins of her Damascus home with her children, ages 5 to 19, after a bombing.
The agencies also teach refugee families English, help them find jobs, provide mental health care and pair them up with a mentor in their neighborhood.
In 2011, that all ended.
"We imagine people from Syria won\'t have coats for Chicago, so we\'re asking for coats, sweaters, boots and outerwear," said Kim Snoddy of RefugeeOne.

However, the distinguished white-haired man who sat next to her was the one who made it happen, and who makes everything happen at the Library of Congress: James H. Billington.
In the age of the Internet, the title "librarian of Congress" might sound old-fashioned.
The Library of Congress holds more than 23 million books, along with many millions of other kinds of publications, from newspapers to sheet music.
New entries on the list include noted movies such as "Saving Private Ryan" and "Ferris Bueller\'s Day Off."
Three are located on Capitol Hill, across the street from the United States Capitol Building, while a fourth is in Virginia.
Billington also has been a force behind library-sponsored events like the National Book Festival.
He oversees the cultural center where the Magna Carta \u2014 on loan from England \u2014 is on display.
"Jim has done a spectacular job in reinventing the job of librarian of Congress," said David Rubenstein, the library\'s head fundraiser.
He has written five books, mostly about Russia.
He also wrote and narrated a PBS-TV documentary on Russia and in 1988 accompanied President Ronald Reagan to a nuclear summit in Moscow.
This week, he announced 25 additions to the National Film Registry.

Their study discovered that the birds do not fly in a straight line.
The geese were followed from their home in Mongolia, a country between China and Russia.
They cross deserts and oceans.
But the scientists added that only a few birds can fly across the high Himalayas between India and central Asia.
One goose flew more than 4 miles high for a short while.
If the birds had gone up in a straight line, they would have spent more energy making the trip.
In the end, it seems to be better for the birds to fly low when they can, and climb to get over a tall peak.

They have a waiting list of Nepalese women who want to join their training program and become mountain guides.
But they had trouble finding more women who knew trekking, spoke English and were willing to spend days walking with foreigners away from home.
"At the beginning it was very unusual for the women to join our program because they had to leave their homes for many days," said Nicky.
The sisters accept 40 students every six months, and give them free housing, food and clothing.
Once they graduate, they make about $3,000 a year, a better-than-average salary in this poor Himalayan nation.

For decades, finding Spanish-language books in the United States was tough.
A paperback copy of "Don Quixote" in the original Spanish could easily cost triple the price of a deluxe hardcover translation in English \u2014 if it could be found at all.
Booksellers blamed the expense of importing books printed in Spain and Latin America.
Imported hardcovers such as Colombian author Alvaro Mutis\' "Maqroll" trilogy once retailed for more than $100.
And entire genres of Latin American literature \u2014 like contemporary Ecuadorean poetry \u2014 that were all but impossible to acquire at any price are now a few mouse clicks away.

A series of lawsuits and a federal investigation launched in Miami this year have revealed that many ballplayers are smuggled out of Cuba by human-trafficking groups in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
"Afterward of course I\'d like to play in the major leagues."
Instead, they choose to play abroad where they can earn more money.
Officials in Cuba have put new policies into effect aimed at keeping their players from leaving.
Up until recently, the rules prohibited players from signing contracts in other countries.
The new rules allow ballplayers to sign offseason contracts in countries like Japan and Mexico.
In other words, Cuban players still cannot compete in the United States without permanently leaving the island.
This year alone, 13 Cuban players signed new major or minor league contracts, up from 10 last year.
Instead, they choose to play in other countries where they can earn more money.
With so many players leaving, the overall talent level of the Cuban league has gone down.
Overall, however, it does not seem to be working.
"There\'s no way that economically Cuba is going to keep enough top players in the country to have the quality of league they had five or 10 years ago," he said.
The new rules allow ballplayers to play in countries like Japan and Mexico.
Cuban officials hoped that these changes would help keep talented players from leaving.

Today\'s young adults have been called the "Peter Pan" generation, because many of them live at home with their parents after college and don\'t seem to want to grow up.
Higher than the 32 percent who lived at home in 1968, the earliest year when data was available.
But a closer look at the 2012 Census Bureau data analyzed by Pew indicates the trend actually may be cause for celebration.
From Arnett\'s book: "In 1960 only 33 percent of young people attended college, and most of them were men.
This is partly because of a slow economy and partly because millennials are hoping for fulfilling work, experts say.
Careers with purpose, meaning and self-growth are important to them, says Varda Konstam, a professor of counseling and school psychology at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and author of "Parenting Your Emerging Adult: Launching Kids From 18 to 29."
And those who do marry are putting it off \u2014 the median age for marriage today is 27 for women and 29 for men, according to the Pew Research Center.
"Emerging adults and their parents tend to have a very similar worldview," Konstam says.
And a brief stay at home is more likely to help, rather than hinder, those goals, she says.

For hundreds of years, human beings have speculated on whether there might be other forms of life somewhere in the universe.
But so far we only know of one planet, Earth, and just one star, our sun, which are able to sustain animals or plants.
A habitable zone is the area near a star where conditions are suitable for a planet to hold liquid water, which is very important for sustaining life.
"All these planets that we\'re finding are quite different than planets in our own solar system," William Borucki, principal investigator at NASA\'s Ames Research Center, told CNN.
But of the three new worlds, experts believe that Kepler-62f is the most similar to Earth.
Borucki added that 62f might be rocky, with polar regions, land and sea.

Evans was thinking about how good it would feel to be back on it, how the success from her rookie season as a bobsled pusher still sent chills of excitement through her.
Evans, 25, went into the gym to begin a workout with her trainer, Jacob Ross.
An online search told her about bobsled tests in the summer of 2012.
She was about to plunge into the unknown: sitting in the back of a 375-pound sled for about 50 seconds at speeds beyond 70 miles per hour.
The pusher sits with her head down and tries not to move her upper body, which could move the sled off the line the driver is steering.
"I feel like I have gotten through the hard part, and now it\'s a victory lap."
She was wearing a purple top, black tights, and pale turquoise sneakers with purple shoelaces.
She launched herself to the top of a stack that was 4 feet, 3 inches high.
Like many people, Aja Evans\' knowledge of bobsled had consisted of what she saw in "Cool Runnings," a movie about even more unlikely bobsledders, from Jamaica.
Erb realized her combination of skills was ideal for a sled pusher.
After the first practice run, Evans wondered what she was doing there.
The push part of a bobsled race lasts 50 meters of a track that is about 30 times that long.
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/AP93848837894.jpg" />It was a steamy August morning and ice was on Aja Evans\' mind.
In this session, there would be sets of box squats, in which she eventually lifted 365 pounds; sets of dead lifts up to 195 pounds; crouching carries of a 40-pound SandBell, a weight that looks sort of like an accordion.
Three months after the tests, Evans found herself on ice at the Olympic bobsled track in Lake Placid, New York.
The driver and pusher, also known as pilot and brakeman, push for 20 or 30 meters.
Her uncle is longtime baseball player Gary Matthews and her cousin is Gary Matthews Jr. who has played baseball for 12 years.
"I feel like I have gotten through the hard part," she said.
She learned more about it during the 2010 Winter Olympics.
Evans decided if she made it through that second run, she would stick with it.

Professor James Gates has big ideas.
Last year, Gates received a National Medal of Science from the National Science Foundation.
Last month, the Harvard Foundation named him Scientist of the Year.
To make an important contribution, all scientists need to blaze a new path.
Gates, however, stands out for his ability to lead others along his path.
This is thanks to his ability to explain the bigger picture.

International health officials warned Friday that the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Africa was exceeding their ability to control it.
The isolation units were built in cooperation with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Writebol is expected to arrive in Atlanta in a few days, the hospital has said.
In Africa, Dr. Margaret Chan, head of the World Health Organization, told leaders of four West African countries that the international group planned to release $100 million to fight the disease.
"The situation in Liberia is dire and there is almost no capacity on the ground to respond," MSF spokeswoman Sandra Murillo said.
It is spread through direct contact with the organs, blood or other secretions of infected people.
People who are infected with the virus experience sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and headaches, along with vomiting and diarrhea.
"Given the health care infrastructure and our ability to isolate people who are infected and to take care of them with the proper protective equipment, it is extraordinarily unlikely that there would be an outbreak in the United States," Dr. Anthony Fauci said Friday.
Still, passersby at Emory University Hospital said they were uncomfortable with the idea of Ebola patients being treated in their hometown.
They shouldn\'t even let them across the border," she said.
Greg Hammock disagreed but admitted he worried about the possibility of the virus spreading.
On Thursday, the CDC warned against travel to the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
Leaders from across Africa will hold a summit next week in Washington, D.C. President Barack Obama said U.S. officials were working to minimize any risk of Ebola spreading to this country.
International health officials warned Friday that the deadly Ebola virus in Africa was moving faster than they could control it.
Writebol is expected to be flown to Atlanta in a few days, the hospital said.

People who are infected with the virus experience sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and headaches.
The disease can cause kidney and liver failure, as well as bleeding inside the body.
"It\'s the lack of health care infrastructure that leads to the problems," he said.

More than 1,300 people have been infected with the virus and 729 have died.
In addition, the aid group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said Friday that the virus was "out of control" in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

California became the first state to pass a law mandating "e-cycling" \u2014 electronic recycling \u2014 in 2003.
Five states \u2014 Connecticut, Maine, Oregon, Vermont and Washington \u2014 have "centralized" or "convenience-based" programs.
Yet some states can see unanticipated costs when a manufacturer meets its annual weight goal and stops paying for local programs.
As electronic devices become smaller and people hold on to them longer, there is sometimes a different problem: it may be difficult for electronics companies to collect enough recycled materials to meet the state weight quotas, said Allison Schumacher at the CEA.
CRTs, part of bulky older televisions and computer monitors, usually containing leaded glass, have largely faded out of production since 2010.
Programs in those states are supported by companies that host electronics buyback programs as well as nonprofit and local government efforts, said Jason Linnell, director of the National Center for Electronics Recycling (NCER).
People get rid of tons of old electronic devices each year.
Plus the metal, plastic and glass in the devices can be recycled.

Electric car maker Tesla Motors has been trying to develop a fully self-driving automobile.
It can find a parking spot and park itself.
For example, the system will note how quickly drivers can safely navigate a particular bend in the road or where stop signs are located.
Musk added a word of caution: Drivers need to keep their hands on the wheel, and the autopilot system will remind them if they do not.
He added that it will probably take longer than that for the government to allow it.
"This is the game we\'re going to be playing, round and round, for the next five to 10 years," Brauer said.

Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, announced \u2014 again \u2014 his candidacy for president on Monday.
"Today, I am announcing that I am running for president of the United States," Cruz said in a speech to students.
That made Cruz, who has been in the Senate since 2013, the first major candidate to formally declare himself running in 2016.
On Monday, Cruz said it again, in person, at the ceremony at Liberty University, which was a required event for students there.
Cruz moved around the stage, urging students to imagine scenarios in which conservative ideals prevailed in Washington.
"Instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values, imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life, and to uphold the sacrament of marriage," he said, focusing on evangelical priorities as well as non-religious conservative ones.
"Instead of a government that works to undermine our Second Amendment rights \u2014 that seeks to ban our ammunition \u2013 imagine a federal government that protects the right to keep and bear arms of all law-abiding Americans."
He managed to make the announcement of something entirely unsurprising \u2014 that he is running for president \u2014 into four separate news events.
By announcing at a evangelical Christian site like Liberty, Cruz is also hoping to attract evangelical voters who might also be interested in possible candidates like former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.

Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, announced his plans to run for president on Monday.
He talked about the power of the American dream and rallying average people to push his campaign forward.
The location of the announcement, at a college, showed that Cruz hopes to get young people involved in his campaign.
At the same time, he will continue to show he is willing to take on both parties and will not budge in his beliefs.
Cruz decided to speak at Liberty to make it clear that he is courting young people, plus evangelicals and conservatives who are frustrated with Republicans in Washington.
That made Cruz the first major candidate to formally declare himself running in 2016.
Many Republican hopefuls have been jockeying unofficially for a spot as the front-runner, including Cruz.
He has managed to beat conservative rivals like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and brain surgeon Ben Carson to the punch.

"I think Atlanta is a natural fit for Major League Soccer," said Blank, who was serenaded by a growing fan group that calls itself "Terminus Legion," a reference to Atlanta\'s former name.
While the Chiefs won the first NASL championship in 1968, both teams struggled financially and eventually folded.
MLS Commissioner Don Garber said there was no hesitation about putting a team in Atlanta, after Blank worked out a stadium deal.
Blank and Garber arrived by helicopter for the introductory news conference, touching down on the roof of a downtown hotel overlooking Centennial Olympic Park.
His first task is to hire a team president for the MLS venture.
He looked down at the red, black and gold scarf draped over his dark suit.
"We will spend a lot of time listening to our fans and trying to understand why some names are more important than others."
MLS Commissioner Don Garber said there was no hesitation about putting a team in Atlanta.
It is also the biggest U.S. city without a top-level soccer team.
The city has a large Hispanic population and last month more than 68,000 fans watched a friendly match between Mexico and Nigeria at the Georgia Dome.
While the new stadium is mainly designed for the Falcons, Blank stressed that it will be soccer-friendly.
Garber said there is no worry about growing too fast given the large amount of soccer talent around the world.
He will also be exploring possible locations for a state-of-the-art training ground.
The newest city to get a Major League Soccer team will be Atlanta, where play will begin in 2017.
"There will never be an MLS game in Atlanta where NFL lines are shown on the field," Blank said.
Major League Soccer announced its newest team on Wednesday, which will be based in Atlanta and begin play in 2017.

After a lifetime in basketball, Kobe Bryant announced Sunday that he will retire after this season.
"I had to just accept the fact that I don\'t want to do this anymore, and I\'m OK with that," Bryant said.

For years, the executives working on the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney resort have said they want to build something both "authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese."
Only when the gates are open next year will planners know if they chose properly.
Disney has had success importing its films into China in recent years, but a portion of the general public is still unclear on just what characters are in the Disney universe.
"We don\'t want people wandering around asking where the \'Transformers\' ride is," said one employee by way of example.
Imagineers had to dig deep for some; for the year of the sheep, for example, they found the Jolly Holiday Lambs from "Mary Poppins."
The managers building the Shanghai Disney resort say they want to build something that looks like Disney but is also truly Chinese.

The managers building the Shanghai Disney resort say they want to build something that looks like Disney but is also truly Chinese.
When the park opens next year, how is it going to be specifically geared to local visitors, without making foreign guests feel out of place?
The park in Hong Kong incorporated Chinese elements into its design and tried to appeal to local visitors with Chinese food and other services.
"We don\'t want people wandering around asking where the \'Transformers\' ride is," said one employee.
For the year of the sheep, for example, they found the Jolly Holiday Lambs from "Mary Poppins."
They will also offer activities such as Chinese board games and calligraphy.
Near the Enchanted Storybook Castle, a restaurant called Wandering Moon Teahouse will serve Chinese food.
The Voyage to the Crystal Grotto ride inside the castle will include the Chinese character Mulan and her dragon, Mushu.
Some of the mash-ups are unexpected, such as a live Tarzan-themed show that will include Chinese acrobats.
He explained the Chinese design elements and performances that were added to tell the Disney stories are the right way to tell those stories.

But the really dicey part, according to many health experts, is just beginning.
The use of new technologies and allowing mid-level medical providers to perform some functions usually reserved for doctors and dentists should improve health care access in the long run.
According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), unless something changes rapidly, there will be a shortage of 45,000 primary care doctors in the United States by 2020.
The growing medical needs of that large age group are creating a huge burden for health care workers.
The retirement of many doctors in the boomer age group is compounding the problem.
During the course of their careers, primary care physicians earn around $3 million less than doctors in specialty fields, like surgery.
As an example, according to the National Council for Behavioral Health, a registered nurse working in mental health earns $42,987.
Negative attention has made medicine in general a far less attractive career choice than it once was, according to Rosenberg of the National Council for Behavioral Health.
Despite the shortages, many believe that new technologies will extend the reach of medicine and help fix the problem.
For example, health care professionals can serve more people by using Skype or other technologies to examine, treat and monitor patients.
Similarly, patients can be fitted with electronic devices that remind them to take their medications and give them advice.
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140106_DOCTORS.jpg" />WASHINGTON \u2014 Signing up for health insurance is just one part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
The really dicey part, according to many health experts, is just beginning.
And a whopping 30 percent are in areas that are short of mental health providers.
Under federal guidelines, there should be no more than 3,500 people for each primary care provider; no more than 5,000 people for each dentist; no more than 30,000 people for each mental health provider.
According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), unless something changes rapidly, there will be a shortfall of 45,000 primary care doctors in the United States by 2020.
In some ways, the lack of providers is worse than the numbers indicate.
During the course of their careers, primary care physicians earn around $3 million less than doctors in specialty fields.
"Men are more engaged in child care today, and they have similar concerns as they consider their career choices," she says.

"In the meantime," said Linda Rosenberg, "people are going to suffer."
According to it, nearly 20 percent of Americans live in areas with too few primary care doctors.
According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), unless something changes rapidly, there will be a shortfall of 45,000 primary care doctors in the United States by 2020.
There will also be a shortage of 46,000 specialists.
She predicts that many of the estimated 36 million Americans expected to gain coverage under Obamacare will endure long wait times to see medical providers in their communities.
Mitchell said the AAMC pushed for the government to pay for training more doctors.
One-sixth live in areas with too few dentists.
Many general doctors and dentists do not accept Medicaid patients because they get paid less to treat them.
In mental health, much of the work is in government jobs.
Yet, the average for nurses is $66,530.
Medicaid is health coverage for poor people.
Or, they will have to travel far from home to see them.

There are various reasons for the shortage of doctors.
Nowadays, Rosenberg said, "the best and the brightest" want jobs in technology or banking, not in medicine.

What they discovered was that the koala behaved differently on hot days than on cooler days.
In the summer, the animals positioned themselves in trees in a way that exposed more of their surface area.
In the winter, koalas climbed higher in the tree and farther out onto the branches.
This seemed to explain why koalas stayed closer to the base of the tree in the summer and up higher in winter.
In summer, the koalas spent 29 percent of their time in these trees, but only 5 percent of their time in the winter.
That could mean the difference between life and death when water is scarce.
This will help humans predict how animals will adapt to a warming climate.
It will also help them choose the kinds of environments most critical to preserve, the researchers added.
In the winter, koalas climbed higher up the tree and farther out onto the branches.
Why would koalas prefer different parts in different seasons?
The trunks were also cooler than the air.
Of all the trees tested, the coolest ones were the Acacia mearnsii trees.
They discovered that koalas behaved differently on warm days and hot days.
The scientists guessed that koalas must do something to cool down in hot weather.

Have you ever seen a 6-year-old use an iPhone?
Most children have been using smartphones and digital tablets practically since birth.
More than one-third of parents who answered a recent survey said their children had "touched or scrolled a screen" before they had celebrated their first birthday.
Another 33 percent of parents said their kids had done so when they were 1 year old.
Only 2 percent of the parents said they had waited until their children were 4 to introduce them to the touch-screen.
Still, 77 percent of them said they had a smartphone, 83 percent had a tablet and 59 percent used the Internet.
Likewise, more than one third of the kids started playing video games when they were 2.
If the children enjoyed playing with the digital devices, the parents seemed to like it too.
Nearly two-thirds of the parents said they used the devices to calm their children, and 29 percent said they used them to get their children to sleep.

The light of the fire interfered with melatonin production, allowing people to stay awake during a time when it was difficult to work.
In a paper, Wiessner argues that conversations that take place at night around a fire have a different quality than those during the day.
Wiessner originally made the recordings hoping to learn how they created and maintained social networks across a vast area of 124 miles.
She returned to Namibia three times between 2011 and 2013 and digitally recorded stories from people she knew in the 1970s.
Of the 122 daytime conversations she recorded, 31 percent of them were devoted to economic discussions.

It says that the mosque "has nothing to do with the marriage of Egyptian men to Syrian sisters.
"People are marrying off their daughters for as little as 100 Jordanian dinars ($70) because of the bad circumstances inside the camp," said Marwa al-Saloumy, who works on women\'s issues for a regional advocacy group called Al-Zahra.
The men come to the areas where Syrians have gathered all day, hoping to escape forced marriages or no prospects at all.
They approach one stranger after another, asking for a woman in the same tone they would ask directions -- security guards at apartment complexes, Muslim clergy, anyone whose accent identifies them as Syrian.
For the Syrians, defending the women in their community has become a means to maintain their dignity while living as refugees.
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are nearly 70,000 Syrian refugees living in Egypt.
But according to the Ministry of Justice in Egypt, the official number of marriages between Egyptian men and Syrian women between January 2012 and March 2013 is 170.
There are even rumors that top members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the secretive religious society through which Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi rose to power, have taken Syrian women as second wives.

We may not own cars in the future, much less drive them.
Hidden under their hoods and dashboards are sensors that take the first steps toward self-driving cars.
Passengers of the future may well view vehicles as just another form of public transportation, to be bought by the trip.
Buying flashy, fast cars for garages could turn into buying time slots on driverless cars, piloted by robots, parked in public stalls.
Companies such as Enterprise Rent-A-Car and Uber will compete with car dealers, taxi companies and even automakers.

For decades, fans of the great American architect Frank Lloyd Wright have been flocking to the S.C. Johnson corporate headquarters in Racine, Wis.
Tourists trooped through the great workroom inside the administration building and craned their heads to look up at the giant lily pad-like structures supporting the roof \u2014 the famous Wisconsin architect compared them to a glade of trees.
And they asked: Can we go inside the tower?
But last Friday, the S.C. Johnson research tower opened to the public for the first time.
Glass tubes encircle the tower, providing natural light and quickly warming the building on hot days.
The original round recessed light fixtures in the ceiling had not aged well and were replaced with copies.

Three goggle-wearing conservators zap away dirt from the marble maidens with custom-designed lasers.
They are surrounded by a white fabric screen to protect visitors from laser beams, which can cause permanent eye injury.
Museum director Dimitris Pantermalis said the main reason for cleaning the sculptures on the spot was to avoid the potential hazards of moving them.
"The fact that it was ... taking place in the museum, it does bring it home to you the actual level of care that is needed to bring these back to life," said British tourist Trevor Richards, from Manchester.
It takes about seven months to cleanse each of the larger-than-life statues, which were carved around 420 B.C.
"It\'s done with very great care to avoid any possible damage," he said.
The technique combines two infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths, to avoid scratching the statues or causing discoloration.
"The laser beam hits the black crust formed on the surface of the statues over the years, and that absorbs energy and disintegrates," said Costas Vassiliadis.
Sometimes they get unwelcome guests.

Killer whales in SeaWorld parks die early.
The company says it provides a healthy and stimulating home for the 29 orcas it owns at four marine parks.
Several studies conducted by U.S. and Canadian government researchers have calculated average lifespans for killer whales in the Pacific Northwest.
But the numbers can change depending on which population was studied and during what period.
The longest lifespan has been estimated at up to 90 years for females and 70 years for males, depending on the study.
But with the little information available, scientists say it can be wrong to compare lifespans between whales in the wild and whales in parks.
Instead, they say, the better comparison to use is the "annual survival rate."
His survey found that a population of orcas off the southern Alaskan coast had annual survival rates of 97 percent to 99 percent, depending on their age.
The best known peer-reviewed study comparing annual survival rates was published in 1995.
The authors calculated an annual survival rate of a little more than 93 percent for captive orcas.
Put another way: Captive whales were dying at a rate of more than 6 percent a year.
That study is still cited today by animal rights groups and other activists.
He added that newer studies seem to show that captive-born whales appear to be surviving at about the same rate as wild whales.
The annual survival rate for killer whales held at SeaWorld parks since the 1960s is much lower.
Killer whales, or orcas, can live as long as humans when left in the ocean.
"This is a debate, but you have to debate with facts," added Hargrove.
But the numbers can change depending on which group was studied and during what period.
Some whales can live much longer.

For nearly a century, daily insulin shots have been a life-saving treatment for people with diabetes.
Now Hayden swallows a small white capsule daily and has his blood checked periodically for signs of diabetes.

Discrimination was a persistent challenge for McAlpin, his son said.
His father told him he was warned that at the White House news conference "someone might step on your foot" and a scuffle would follow.
Not missing a beat, his father had replied: "I always thought the White House press would be the cream of the crop.

In Paris, the Louvre unveiled a preview Tuesday of the art that the Abu Dhabi project has bought since 2009.
French President Francois Hollande opened the exhibition of about 160 works entitled "Birth of a Museum."
It also features a swath of Renaissance and modern masterpieces by artists such as Yves Klein, Rene Magritte and Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso).
However, skeptics in France say the nation known for its "nouveau riche," French for newly rich, can\'t simply buy its way into being "cultured."
One expert noted that many European collections were built in less desirable ways.
The United Arab Emirates is certainly rich enough to be a first-class nation.
But the project has been raising eyebrows among Europeans, who say that culture takes more than a checkbook.
However, skeptics in France say the United Arab Emirates can\'t simply buy its way into being "cultured."
The United Arab Emirates is a country in the Middle East with lots of oil and lots of money.
The exhibition includes religious items like a 19th-century Yemeni Torah and a 13th-century Gothic Bible.

U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Thursday ordered the military to open all combat jobs to women.
However, he added that the integration of women into the combat jobs will be deliberate and methodical and will address the Marine Corps concerns.
But he said that now, his focus is "to lead the full integration of women in a manner that maintains our joint war-fighting capability, ensures the health and welfare of our people, and optimizes how we leverage talent across the joint force."
While noting that, on average, men and women have different physical abilities, Carter said the services must assign tasks and jobs based on ability, rather than on gender.
It will wipe away generations of limits on how and where women can fight for their country.
The Army, Navy and Air Force have moved steadily toward allowing women to serve in all posts.
Dunford had been the only service chief to recommend that some front-line combat jobs stay male-only, according to several U.S. officials.
The senior defense official said that while Carter recognizes there may be difficulties in opening the jobs to women, he has made his decision and all the services will follow it.
For that reason, the defense secretary said, the military should recruit women into as many specialties as possible.
When Dunford was head of the Marines, he was the only chief to recommend that some front-line combat jobs stay male-only, according to several U.S. officials.
Answering a question from a Marine in Italy, Carter said, "You have to recruit from the American population.

The Army, Navy and Air Force have all moved steadily toward allowing women to serve in all posts.
For that reason, as many jobs should be open to women as possible, Carter said.
At one time, women could not be soldiers or sailors.
Dunford had argued that the Marines should be allowed to keep women out of certain front-line combat jobs.
In a statement, Dunford said he had provided his best military advice on the matter.
In October, he told U.S. troops in Italy that limiting his search for soldiers to just half the U.S. population would be "crazy."
He had given Dunford until the end of October to recommend which jobs, if any, should remain closed to women.
When Dunford was head of the Marines, he was the only chief to recommend that some front-line combat jobs stay male-only, according to several U.S. officials.
Carter had pledged to look over the recommendations, particularly those of the Marine Corps.
However he said he generally believes that any qualified person should have the chance to compete for military jobs.
For that reason, Carter said, the military should recruit women into as many specialties as possible.

"I was flying through the air, somersaulting, and everything was upside down and backwards," he said on Friday.
"He was doing a lot of bailing in order to keep the boat up," Davis said.
Jordan survived on some limited food on board: flour pancakes fried on a propane stove and raw fish he caught with a hand net, Davis said.
He rationed his food and water, drinking just a pint a day for long stretches, and collected rainwater.
"For such a long time I was so thirsty," he said early Friday.
"And I was almost out of water, and every day I was like, \'Please God, send me some rain, send me some water.\'
And finally, right before I ran out of water, finally the conditions were perfect."
"They saw me on the front of my boat, standing up there waving my arms, and they turned that huge skyscraper around," Jordan said Friday.
"I was afraid that you guys were crying and sad that, you know, I was dead, and I wasn\'t dead."
Back at home in North Carolina on Friday, his stepfather said Jordan was looking forward to seeing family and eating barbecue and strawberry ice cream again.

"I got down onto the deck, and he walked right up to me," said Kyle McCollum, of the U.S. Coast Guard, who lifted Jordan off the ship.
In the helicopter, Jordan pulled out two of the things that he said had kept him going: his battered and jacket-less Bible and the blanket that had shielded him from the sun.
"I was afraid that you guys were crying and sad that, you know, I was dead, and I wasn\'t dead," he said.

Britain has invested nearly $6.7 million to increase research in the London-Oxford-Cambridge area.
They added a salt and sugar solution to the mold to recreate the sponge-like feel of a natural nose.
The team is creating other body parts including heart parts and ears.
Today children who need new ears must have an invasive surgery, says Griffin.
"I\'m convinced engineered organs are going to be on the market soon," said Suchitra Sumitran-Holgersson, a professor of biology at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.
"People think your nose is very individual and personal, but this is something that we could mass produce like in a factory one day."
Scientists in England are growing noses, ears and veins in a lab.
So far, only a handful of patients have received the London-made body parts.
Britain has invested $6.7 million to increase research in London.
The material used to make the body parts is a chemical mixture called a polymer.
Last year, Seifalian and his team used that polymer material to mold a nose for a British man who had lost his when he got cancer.
They added a salt and sugar solution to the mold to recreate the sponge-like feel of a human nose.
Scientists have to perfect noses and ears before making more complicated body parts, explains Eileen Gentelman.
Among the more challening body parts to make are kidneys, lungs and livers.
She has given lab-made blood vessels to a handful of patients.

"We will do everything we can to rescue everyone trapped in there, no matter they\'re still alive or not, and we will treat them as our own families," Hubei military region commander Chen Shoumin said.
Zhang, the tour guide, said in an interview from his hospital bed that he grabbed a life jacket with seconds to spare as the ship listed in the storm.
Others were rescued after search teams climbed on the upside-down hull and heard people yelling for help from inside, more than 12 hours after the ship overturned.

It sounds like something from a horror movie: A beautiful, feathery-looking species of fish but with venomous spines and a ferocious appetite sweeps into the Gulf of Mexico, devouring everything in its path.
"The invasive lionfish have been nearly a perfect predator," says Martha Klitzkie, director of operations at the Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) in Key Largo, Florida.
"They\'re moving into new areas and, when they get settled, the population increases pretty quickly."
According to a study by Oregon State University in 2012, native prey fish populations in the Bahamas fell an average of 65 percent in just two years.
Their stripes are like those of a zebra.
They hang near coral heads or underwater structures where reef fish flourish.
They wait for their prey to draw near, then gulp them down in a flash.
In the South Pacific, predators and disease keep lionfish in check.
The few groupers that have been spotted taste-testing lionfish have spit them back out.
Each one contains the stuff found in the stomach of a lionfish collected in the Flower Garden Banks.
They like crevices and holes and can find them on anything from a coral head to a drilling platform to a sunken ship.
The effects of their invasion could become widespread, scientists warn.
"It\'s a snowball effect of negativity."
The only known way to keep lionfish in check here, scientists say, is man.
Participants have removed more than 12,000 lionfish since the fishing series started in 2009.
In the Gulf, researchers like Johnston have special permits that allow them to remove lionfish when they spot them in the Flower Garden Banks, but they need help.

Lionfish, a maroon-and-white striped native of the South Pacific, first showed up off the coast of southern Florida in 1985.
Thanks to that, they now are more common in the Bahamas than their home waters.

In January 1964, President Lyndon Johnson declared "all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United States."
Arkansas also remains above average at 20 percent.
"There has been some catch-up over the decades," he said.
In 2012, its rate was 10.3 percent \u2014 no longer lowest in the nation (New Hampshire, at 8 percent, held that distinction), but among the lowest.
Nationally, it shows a similar poverty rate, but some states with low official rates have a higher rate under the supplemental measure.
California, with its high cost of living, is worst at 24 percent by the supplemental measure, more than 7 percentage points higher than its official rate.
New Jersey and Florida also see their poverty rates jump by more than 4 percentage points, to 18 percent and 20 percent, respectively.
The biggest change has been in the West, which had 15 percent of poor Americans in 1969 but 24 percent of them in 2012.
Both states also have slightly lower education levels for residents than the national average, according to Census figures.
On the other hand, some of the states that were poorest in 1959 and today appear much better under the supplemental measure.
Poverty experts and advocates for the safety net give credit to programs that prop up family incomes.
"We\'re doing the best we can to fight poverty, and we\'re doing a pretty good job," said Timothy Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin.
In 2012, its rate was 10.3 percent \u2014 no longer the lowest in the nation (New Hampshire, at 8 percent, was), but among the lowest.
There could be a few reasons why: The two states rank in the top 10 nationally for share of population under 65 years old without health care, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The Census, for example, has said 5 million more Americans would have been considered poor in 2012 without food stamps, not to mention other safety-net benefits.
"We\'re doing the best we can to fight poverty, and we\'re doing a pretty good job," said Timothy Smeeding, who runs the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin.

It then looked at state-by-state poverty levels from 1980 to 2012 from a government survey.
Louisiana and Georgia each had official poverty rates of nearly 40 percent in 1959.
People in both states also have slightly lower education levels than the national average, according to Census figures.

The Mauna Kea mountain in Hawaii is a treasure to many people.
Native Hawaiians believe that their gods live at its summit.
Ever since 1968, when the first plans for a telescope were announced, activists have opposed building on the mountain.
In the past, its summit was so holy that only high chiefs and priests were allowed to climb up to it.
"However, I do not believe it is of so much importance that it should be allowed to overtake and destroy everything else."
"We can take the time to do things right and set an example."
Mauna Kea is a special mountain in Hawaii.
The telescope will see as much as 100 times farther away than any other telescope.
It is where the mother and father of Hawaiians first met.
While free-roaming dogs are a global issue, it has been spotlighted in Sochi because of reports that Olympic organizers hired contractors to kill at least 2,000 animals.
Most of the dogs are friendly instead of the teeth-baring wild animals that often run in packs \u2014 which explains why a number of visiting athletes are among those trying to help.

Rouhani urged world leaders on Friday "to make the most of the mandate for prudent engagement that my people have given me, and to respond genuinely to my government\'s efforts to engage in constructive dialogue."
Rouhani will come accompanied by a Jewish Iranian legislator, Siamek Morsadegh.
Rouhani used his Twitter account this month to send best wishes to Jews celebrating the Rosh Hashana holiday.
"After eight years of an erratic, unpredictable president who would say outlandish things, you have a normal person as the president of Iran," said Haleh Esfandiari, a former political prisoner under Ahmadinejad.
Rouhani\'s appeal \u2014 it\'s already being called "Rouhanimania" \u2014 is apparent in the huge demand for tickets to a dinner he will have with several hundred Iranian-Americans in New York.
Whether Rouhani is simply presenting a more moderate face to the world or is open to compromise to end the nuclear dispute is still unclear.
He speaks English well, having lived in Scotland in the 1990s as a Ph.D. candidate.
Rouhani has tried to appeal to the West without upsetting hard-liners at home.
They apparently want sanctions eased enough so that they could reconnect to the global clearinghouse for international financial transactions called SWIFT.
The White House says it has not scheduled a meeting between President Barack Obama and the 64-year-old Rouhani.
Two years ago, the Iranian mission to the U.N. canceled a similar dinner with Ahmadinejad.
He said the United States and Iran can "turn threats into opportunities."
He is more soft-spoken and is likely to give a conciliatory address to world leaders this week.

This month marks the 40th anniversary of the discovery of Lucy, one of the earliest ancestors of humans.
He and his team named the fossil after the Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds," which played repeatedly the night he made the discovery.
She showed us that it happened in eastern Africa, and more specifically in the area of Ethiopia where she was found.
So what has changed is that we understand it was not a straight line from the earliest species to modern humans, and that there were many false starts.
The features that distinguish us from all other animals are language, our cooperation, and a culture that allows us to make developments that build on what came before, which no single individual could make alone.
There are thousands of fossils in vaults throughout the world that have not been deeply studied.
There are also rock formations throughout Africa that have not been thoroughly examined, and I think new discoveries will be made that will be surprising.

The same virus that is killing starfish today was also found in museum starfish specimens going back to 1942, indicating that the disease has been present in the Pacific Ocean for 72 years.
Within days, they curl up and parts of their arms break off, actually crawling away.
The cause could be natural, like overpopulation of starfish in some areas.
Still, big questions remain.
"What started it all off?
"There are 10 million viruses in a drop of seawater, so discovering the virus associated with a marine disease can be like looking for a needle in a haystack," said Cornell microbiologist Ian Hewson, co-author of the study.
Those are really important questions."
Millions of sea stars have died in the past year from Mexico to Alaska in one of the largest ocean die-offs ever seen.
It was first detected in Washington state in June 2013.
The disease has even killed sea stars in major aquariums in Seattle, Monterey and other cities.
Within days, they curl up and parts of their arms break off and crawl away.
They said the disease is a type of densovirus, similar to viruses that affect insects, sea urchins and other invertebrates \u2014 animals without a backbone.
And there is no way to offer a cure to starfish populations.
"There are 10 million viruses in a drop of seawater, so discovering the virus associated with a marine disease can be like looking for a needle in a haystack," said Cornell microbiologist Ian Hewson, co-author of the study.
Working with 335 sea stars collected on the West Coast, the Cornell researchers exposed healthy starfish to infected ones, learning how the disease spread.
Sea stars in Big Sur and other areas had many offspring over the past year, scientists say.

Hamlet Garcia climbed up the steps of a courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, last year, wondering if he would be sent to jail.
Hamlet and his wife, Olesia, were about to go on trial for theft of services, an offense usually reserved for cable service thieves and restaurant bill dodgers.
"I\'m hearing about it more and more every year," said Gloria Romero, a former California state senator and parent activist.
And while perhaps extreme, they are worrying civil rights activists, parent advocacy groups and some local leaders.
They say strict enforcement measures unfairly affect poor families of color.
In the case of the Garcias, the father says that during the 2011-2012 school year, he and his wife had problems in their marriage and lived separately.
They "essentially stole from every hard-working taxpayer" who lives in the school district, Ferman said.
In Michigan, parents convicted of providing false documents can be jailed for up to 20 days.
In Washington, D.C., they can get up to 90 days for providing false documentation.
"It\'s a \'gotcha\' thing," said Gwen Samuel, the founder of the Connecticut Parents Union, which has helped to support a handful of families that have been criminally charged for education theft.
Around the country, parent groups are fighting back by publicizing the cases and lobbying against jail time.
The groups argue that school residency laws are unconstitutional because they treat parents in struggling school districts differently.
Across the country, some parents are being accused of "stealing an education" for their children.

Noah Madson remembers being tested for ADHD, a disorder that makes it hard to concentrate.
The game, called "Groundskeeper," asks the user to use one cube to hit a gopher that pops up on the screens of the other three cubes.
The cubes produce information on more than 70 different things, including errors, response times and even whether the player is fidgeting.
But, Heller said, one thing is clear: People who take care of children with ADHD could use extra help.
"We\'re doing the best we can to make sure we\'re not selling something that gets people\'s hopes up and doesn\'t work."
Nancy Madson said she\'s thrilled about the game, which Heller said was designed to be "just boring enough" to not give the brain too much excitement.

Much of what we know about how chimpanzees behave is because of one person: Jane Goodall.
When she was in her early 20s, Goodall received an invitation from a school friend to visit Africa.
"But her story lets kids know that if you love something, if you really want something, you can change the world."
Throughout "Untamed," Silvey offers ideas for helping endangered animals and addressing animal treatment problems.
She also loved being in nature and reading books like "The Story of Doctor Dolittle," a fictional tale about a veterinarian who travels to Africa and learns to speak to animals.

Leakey encouraged Goodall and helped her study chimpanzees in the wild.
"It\'s not that everyone can have Jane Goodall\'s life," Silvey says.

A new children\'s book titled, "Untamed: The Wild Life of Jane Goodall," documents Jane\'s life and her important scientific discoveries.

Is there something I can learn here that is actually a way for my life to go?
In her early 20s, Goodall got an invitation from a school friend to visit Africa.
Silvey writes that Goodall "focused on chimpanzees as individuals, with their own special personalities."
At the time, the scientific community recorded animals with numbers.
Silvey\'s book contains many wonderful pictures, including four pages that make up a chimpanzee "family scrapbook."
"But her story lets kids know that if you love something and you work hard for it, you can change the world."
Once she was in Africa, Goodall got a job with a man named Louis Leakey.
The Gombe Stream Game Reserve is a national park.

"We certainly know with the regulatory environment out there that happened with orcas, and some of what happened in California," Manby said.
Eight years ago, Texas started a trend by making high school students tackle algebra II.
"It\'s funny that the banner-turning state would be backing off not so many years later," said Jennifer Dounay Zinth.
Mike Meroney, a coalition spokesman, said that with fewer state-mandated courses, districts can better work with local employers to prepare high school graduates for high-paying jobs.
The new changes still require algebra II for honors diplomas, or for diploma plans focusing on science, technology, engineering and math courses.
Critics of the move include the powerful lobbying group Texas Association of Business, which accused Texas of dumbing-down its required courses.
"That would have been a dream come true, if I had stopped after geometry," said Hutt, an 11th- grader at Alamo Heights High School in San Antonio.
Witte said the course is helpful, but he and Texas lawmakers argued the rigorous math course was pushing some students to drop out.
"There\'s a fear that if we set higher standards for all students, more students will drop out," Zinth said.
Eight years ago, Texas started a national trend by making high school students take a class called algebra II.
Stephen Waddell, superintendent in the Dallas suburb of Lewisville, said mandating algebra II was unnecessary.
But the Texas Education Agency reported last summer that nearly 88 percent of students from the Class of 2012 graduated on time.
Texas began making high school students take a class called algebra II eight years ago.
It was also the fifth straight year of improvement.
But it goes on and on after that," said Patte Barth, director of the Center for Public Education.
He said that taking away requirements for advanced math and science would leave students badly prepared for college and technical careers.
He said his company offers well-paying jobs for people with two-year degrees or who got job training in high school.
They found no link between graduation rates and higher standards, said Zinth, the education policy analyst.

20-year-old woman in Taiwan has the unfortunate distinction of being the first patient known to come down with a strain of bird flu called H6N1.
A follow-up X-ray taken on May 17 showed that her respiratory infection had cleared up.
Six of these people became ill with fevers or respiratory infections, including one of the doctors who treated several patients with respiratory infections but did not wear a surgical mask or take other standard precautions.
"Each person infected with an animal influenza virus is judged a threat to public health, because the influenza pandemics of the past 100 years have all emerged from animals," Marion Koopmans, a virologist at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands, wrote in a explanation that accompanies the study.

Education increases the chances that, someday, children will be able to support themselves and seek a better life for their families.
And it can give them a desire to seek reconciliation when the conflicts have been resolved and the catastrophes have ended.
In the 35 countries most affected by violence, 65 million children ages 3 to 15 are at risk of missing out on learning.
And according to new data released by the Education for All Global Monitoring Report, young women living in conflict-affected areas are nearly 90 percent more likely to be out of high school or middle school than women in more stable countries.
This is a huge problem, given that even a single year of additional schooling for girls increases both their earning power and the likelihood that they will send their own children to school.
Though the number of children affected by crisis is reaching an all-time high, the funding to help support countries with education in emergencies remains outrageously low.
Learning is not only a critical element of relief for every child in an emergency, but also a crucial investment in the future development of their societies.
For we face a choice, one that we must make together: Should we spend more now on education in emergencies, or pay the price of a lost generation of poorly educated children who will someday not have enough knowledge from school to rebuild their broken societies?
Humans use hands, sharks and wolves use their jaws, but frogs are among the few animals that use something much stranger: their tongues.
Then they offered up delicious grasshoppers behind the glass.
One enthusiastic young frog managed to slam his tongue into the plate with 3.4 times the force of his own weight.
In contrast to structural adhesives like glue \u2014 which harden to form a permanent bond \u2014 pressure-sensitive adhesives use a substance somewhere between a solid and liquid.
The tongue prints they left behind gave scientists an idea of the size of the contact area and the amount of mucus on the tongue.
One hungry young frog managed to slam his tongue into the plate with 3.4 times the force of his own weight.
It must be fluid enough to form a connection between the surfaces it binds, but elastic enough to resist being ripped apart.
But someday we might look back and see how frog tongues helped us lick the problem of sticky tape.
When the hungry frogs fired their "ballistic tongues" (yes, that\'s the real scientific term), the sensors measured their force.
Every predator needs to catch its prey, even frogs.
For the experiment, the researchers used the horned frog, a round South American amphibian with evil-looking "horns" above its eye sockets.
One hungry young frog managed to slam his tongue into the plate with 3.4 times the force of his own weight.
She is an amphibian biologist in Arizona who was not involved in the study.
Kleinteich thinks how it works most is closest to pressure-sensitive adhesion.
Then they placed delicious grasshoppers behind the glass.
He is the lead author of the study and a zoologist in Germany.
This ability to bring in large prey would be a particular help to a sit-and-wait species like the horned frog, said Kiisa Nishikawa.
It is a lot like what allows sticky tape and labels to cling to a surface and later be removed without a trace.
Every predator needs to catch its prey, even frogs.
They use a sticking substance similar to the glue on Post-it notes.
The horned frog is a round South American amphibian with evil-looking "horns" above its eye sockets.
These gave scientists an idea of the size of the contact area and the amount of mucus on the tongue.
However, the results give another possible reason for fast-flicking frogs.
Other adhesives like glue harden to form a permanent bond.
It must be fluid enough to form a connection between the surfaces it binds but elastic enough to resist being ripped apart.

They found that some frogs can lift food up to three times heavier than their own weight.
Then they catch their victims with their strong tongues.
Then they placed grasshoppers behind the glass.
One meal is all they might need to eat for a whole year, Nishikawa said.
What they did next changed everything parents, teachers and students thought they knew about grading.
Instead, grades are based on exam results and the quality of work.
Critics say the approach may sound good on paper.
But what that means in the classroom is another matter, they say.
Under standards-based grading, students face no penalty for failing to turn in homework.
When new grading policies were explained to middle school parents this year, their jaws dropped.
"The general mood of the room was, \'This isn\'t how I had it growing up.\'"
"The learning is what\'s important, it\'s not just the \'check off\' of getting the grade in the grade book," said Karen Hargadine, executive director of pre-K and elementary education for the Rockwood School District in the St. Louis area.
A few schools even make students stay in during recess until missing homework is finished.
"Parents trust that schools are preparing their children for life after high school," the teacher wrote.
"We\'re seeing a change and it\'s pretty powerful."
But what it means is another matter, they say.
"That\'s not real life," Bozdeach said.
Since the change, Lincoln moved from the bottom of the district on state tests to the top.
Parents thought their kids were doing great at Lincoln Elementary School.
"There are kids that are good at playing the game of school," said Julie Williams.
But what it means is another matter, they say.
"We\'re seeing a change and it\'s pretty powerful," she said.
The usual way of grading can hide failure.
A student might earn a D in math.

The remote-controlled aircraft known as a drone has been a powerful but controversial weapon against terror.
Whether the drone proves an effective mosquito hunter or not, the test shows how unmanned aerial vehicles are quickly changing.
"I would have laughed two years ago if you would have told me this could help with mosquito control," said Derek Lyons, the company\'s vice president of sales.
The battery-powered drone weighs 2.6 pounds and has a wing span of just over 2-\xbd feet.
Or, thanks to wings made of flexible metal fabric, it can be shot from a 6-inch-diameter carrying tube.
The drone can fly for up to 70 minutes in a six-mile radius, cruising at about 30 miles per hour.
Doyle estimated the tactic gets rid of about 80 percent of marsh mosquitoes.
The remote-controlled plane known as a drone has been used to fight terrorists and criminals.
"Once we get down and work with them for a couple of days, we can probably tweak things to make it work."
Drones are remote-controlled planes that are used to fight terrorists and criminals.
On Sept. 2, the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District began testing a next-generation drone.
The new [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) is about half the size of the large sea hawks commonly seen in the Keys.
Instead, it will be rigged with an infrared thermal camera that detects differences in temperature.
If the bird-size drone can accurately spot such pools, it could save mosquito-fighters time, effort and money.
"Our people on the ground have to walk an hour to a marsh and find out what\'s there,\'\' said district leader Michael Doyle.
Whether the drone proves to be a good mosquito hunter or not, the test shows how unmanned planes are quickly changing.
In coming years, researchers at the University of Florida hope to use drones for a variety of new purposes.

whale that apparently took a wrong turn up an African river about 17 million years ago may offer clues to the climate-change forces that shaped human evolution.
Lost for more than 30 years, the fossilized beak and jaw bone of the 22-foot whale helps to determine that the East African Plateau probably began rising no earlier than 17 million years ago, according to a study.
He had read about the 1964 find by James G. Mead in a 1975 research paper.
Finally, just before another trip to Kenya in 2011, a collections official at Harvard located the fossil there, Jacobs said.
Even the Antarctic minke whale that took the longest known detour, more than 600 miles up the Amazon, reached an elevation of little more than 3 feet above the Atlantic Ocean sea level.
The whale bone was found in a thick layer of debris beneath a lava flow dated to 17 million years old, according to the study.
The drying changed a humid forest into grasslands with more widely spaced trees.
Scientists theorize that this kind of environmental pressure favored primates that could straighten their backs and walk longer distances on two feet.
Scientists are excited about a whale that apparently took a wrong turn up an African river about 17 million years ago.
A humpback whale, named Humphrey, twice swam a more modest 82 miles up the Sacramento River in California.
Based on the sea level and shape of the African coast at the time, the whale would have traveled 372 to 559 miles from the Indian Ocean.
The whale bone was found in a thick layer of broken rocks beneath a lava flow that was 17 million years old, according to the study.
Scientists think that this kind of environmental pressure favored primates that could straighten their backs and walk longer distances on two feet.
Scientists think they have found important evidence that can help them understand how early human beings evolved, or developed.

Gay people cannot be excluded from serving as jurors on a trial just because of their sexual orientation, according to a federal appeals court Tuesday.
The unanimous decision Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a jury verdict in a case involving an AIDS drug.
Discriminatory laws must be closely evaluated to "ensure that our most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or second-class status," wrote Judge Stephen Reinhardt.
Excluding gay jurors violated their constitutional right to equal protection under the law.
They predicted that it would help them win marriage rights in other Western states besides California, where same-sex marriage is legal.
After a four-week trial, the jury decided in favor of Abbott, but awarded GlaxoSmithKline $3.5 million in damages.
"Jury service is one of the most important responsibilities of an American citizen," Reinhardt wrote.
"It gives gay and lesbian individuals a means of (expressing) their values and a voice in resolving controversies that affect their lives as well as the lives of all others."
But "if the real reason is bias, they have to be quick on their feet to come up with another reason, and it has to be consistent with how they treated other jurors," Davidson said.
Adelle M. Infante, a representative for Abbott, said, "We are reviewing the opinion and evaluating our options."
People cannot be kept off a jury just because they are gay, a federal appeals court decided Tuesday.

The decision will also make it harder to justify laws that treat gays and lesbians differently.
This includes laws against same-sex marriage, lawyers said.
Gays are fighting laws in four Western states that prevent men from marrying men and women from marrying women.
"This is really a very big deal," said Jon W. Davidson, the legal director of Lambda Legal, a group that fights for gay rights.
He said the decision would make it "exceedingly difficult" for states to discriminate against gays.
The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by a drug company, now called GlaxoSmithKline, against Abbott Laboratories, another drug company.
AIDS, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, is a deadly disease transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids.
Before a jury trial, the lawyers for both sides pick the men and women of the jury.
On appeal, Abbott gave several reasons for excluding the man.
Yet, during 80 or 90 percent of their time as police officers, they can treat people "with that kind of character and spirit."

On Monday, the Supreme Court told employers that they cannot discriminate on the basis of religion.
Scalia said the Civil Rights Act of 1964 puts the legal burden on employers not to discriminate.
He had sought the right to maintain a short beard despite the prison\'s "no beards" policy.
On Monday, the Supreme Court voted in favor of religious freedom.
The law says employers may not "refuse to hire" or otherwise discriminate against someone because of their "race, color, religion, sex or national origin."
It said the company was not liable because she did not ask for a special accommodation for her religion.

Experts in workplace discrimination said the decision could have a big effect.
The act says businesses may not "refuse to hire" someone because of their "race, color, religion, sex or national origin."
Wanting a particular person to follow those rules is not discrimination, he argued.
On Monday, Justice Clarence Thomas was the only judge to side with Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.
Workers cannot be treated unfairly because of their religion, the court declared.
Such unfair treatment is known as discrimination.

Research has shown that primates can produce unique calls for things or events.
In contrast, human speech can change over time and be taught.
Other research has shown that primates and non-primates change their calls.
"But it could also be more likely that it\'s some aspect of a social bonding," he said.

The researchers think the chimpanzees were driven by the need to get along.
He said that if he learned that "gato" means cat in Spanish, then he has learned a new word for cat.
Their discovery suggests something else important about language.
It may have been present 7 million to 13 million years ago in the last ancestor of chimpanzees and humans.
But the process of the chimp groups getting to know one another was slow too.
new study says chimpanzees can learn language.
In 2010, a group of chimpanzees was transferred from the Netherlands to a zoo in Scotland.
At first, the two groups of chimps used different sounds for apples.
Three years later, they had developed a common sound to stand for the fruit.
Before, scientists thought learning language from each other was something only humans could do.
By 2013, it became clear the grunts the Dutch chimps made for apples had changed.
However, this is the first time anyone has shown that an animal learned a new call from another animal.
Snowdon pointed out that the chimps took time to warm up.

John J. Guehl III, chief of ophthalmology at West Penn Hospital, described it as a kind of optical illusion.
The brain figures out the important parts of a picture, and factors out and ignores the rest of it.
"It decides what\'s the part that counts and makes changes on how it is perceiving the other parts," he said.
Some people might pay less attention to the blue background light, which makes the person see the dress as gold and white, Guehl said.
Kiel Conjack thought his wife was pranking him when she said she saw blue and black.
It "felt good" to be eventually proven right, he said.

"I will be rearranging my schedule as necessary so I can undergo treatment by physicians at Emory Healthcare," Carter said.
Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said "there\'s a lot we don\'t know," but the first task likely will be determining where the cancer started.
The first task is to determine whether the cancer is curable, "which is unlikely with metastatic cancer," which means cancer that has spread, Balducci said.
"Cancer in a 90-year-old is a serious problem, but that does not mean a 90-year-old cannot benefit from treatment," he said.
In May, he was forced to cut short a visit to Guyana to observe elections there when he developed a bad cold.
Carter also completed a book tour this summer to promote his latest work, "A Full Life."
He wrote that his father, brother and two sisters all died of the disease and said the trend "concerned" the former president\'s doctors at Emory.
Carter was a Georgia peanut farmer who had been a state senator and governor of Georgia for a single term before running for president.
Carter spent the decades since carving out a reputation for promoting such global issues as health care and democracy, often with his wife Rosalynn by his side.
He wrote that "may have been what led to my longer life."

Animal-rights activists say a macaque monkey who took now-famous selfie photographs should be declared the copyright owner of the photos.
Copyright Office issued an updated summary of its policies, including a section saying that it would register copyrights only for works produced by human beings.
However, Jeffrey Kerr, a lawyer with PETA, said the copyright office policy "is only an opinion," and the U.S.
The lawsuit asserts that Naruto "authored the monkey selfies by his own independent, autonomous actions in examining and manipulating Slater\'s unattended camera."
He says the British copyright obtained for the photos by his company, Wildlife Personalities Ltd., should be honored worldwide.
Last year, as the dispute simmered, Slater offered copies of a "monkey selfie" photo to purchasers willing to pay only for shipping and handling.
Laurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor who supports animal rights, expressed misgivings about the lawsuit.

Though they have "rat" in their name, the Allegheny woodrats are nothing like the common rats that run across subway rails and leap out of urban dumpsters.
Once common from New England to Alabama, the woodrat has disappeared from Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York, has greatly declined in Pennsylvania, and is nearly gone from Ohio and Indiana.
"Because of roads and development, there no longer is any way for this group to have genetic exchange," said Mick Valent, principal zoologist with the state Department of Environmental Protection.
Valent is on a mission to help save the woodrats of the Palisades by trying to keep the colony healthy and possibly importing woodrats from other regions.
They also collect dried raccoon droppings, which contain undigested seeds and berries that the woodrats can feed on.
Twice a year, in spring and fall, Valent travels by boat along the Hudson and lands at the hard-to-get areas at the foot of the Palisades where woodrats live.
There, he sets out bait for raccoons, mixed with dewormer.
The idea of transferring woodrats from one state to another is not new.
And in the 1970s gypsy moths killed off or weakened many oaks, especially on the rocky Pennsylvania ridge tops where woodrats lived.

The first blow came in the early 1900s, when the American chestnut was almost wiped out by a fungus.
Woodrats would store the nuts through the winter.
Some years they produce a lot of acorns, other years they produce very few.

Scientists have discovered the bones of a new dinosaur in Patagonia, Argentina.
From head to tail, it measured 85 feet, including its 37-foot-long neck and 30-foot-long tail.
Nothing could have attacked Dreadnoughtus and won, scientists say, because it was just too big.
The dinosaur found in Patagonia died sometime between 66 million and 84 million years ago.
Lacovara first stumbled on the crumbled bones of the Dreadnoughtus during a fossil-hunting trip in February 2005.
"I found a little cluster of broken-up bones," said Lacovara.
They lived in the Southern Hemisphere for 30 million years and died out some 66 million years ago.

Suspects have been detained in connection with a daring diamond robbery that happened in February at Brussels International Airport in Brussels, Belgium.
By the time police officers were called, the robbers had vanished.
When captured, police also found uncut diamonds and more than $100,000 cash.
During a civil war that stretched from 1991 until 2002 in the African country of Sierra Leone, illegal diamond mining was very common.
Today, while several countries take part in the Kimberley Process (including the United States and many European countries), some still worry that diamonds bought and sold are coming from sources that are unclear or that the miners are not being fairly paid.
One of the largest heists happened in February 2005 at the Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, a city in the Netherlands, when two men disguised in airline uniforms drove a stolen truck onto the tarmac and stole $118 million worth of diamonds from another truck nearby.
Back in February 2003, a group of men at the Antwerp World Diamond Centre in Antwerp, Belgium, pretended they were diamond merchants and broke into a vault.
Police paid her no attention and just a few days later, it was found that jewel thieves had drilled a tunnel underneath a jewelry store.
One morning, they popped up from their hole, tied up the store staff, and made off with $20 million in jewelry.

RLIN, Germany \u2013 Over the last 15 years, the bottled-water industry has grown at an explosive rate, a trend that shows no sign of slowing.
In fact, bottled water \u2013 including everything from "purified spring water" to flavored water and water enriched with vitamins, minerals, or electrolytes \u2013 is the largest area of growth in the beverage industry, even in cities where tap water is safe.
The bulk of bottled water sold worldwide is drawn from subterranean water reserves, many of which feed rivers and lakes.
But bottling the runoff from glaciers in the Alps, the Andes, the Arctic, the Cascades, the Himalayas, Patagonia, the Rockies, and elsewhere is not much better.
This has not stopped big bottlers and other investors from aggressively seeking to buy the rights to glacier water.
In the 1990s, it was PET that turned water into a convenient, portable, lightweight product.
But PET does not decompose, and, while it can be recycled, it usually is not.
In the United States, where the volume of bottled water sold last year increased 7 percent from 2013, 80 percent of all plastic water bottles become litter, stuffing landfills.
Indeed, taste tests reveal that people cannot tell the difference between bottled and tap water.
When a product that is cheaper and better does not win, that is bad news for consumers.

Thatcher was such a strong politician that she became known as the "Iron Lady," a nickname she enjoyed.
A gifted student, Thatcher went to Oxford University, where she became more and more interested in politics.
She quickly rose through the ranks to become a member of Parliament in 1959.
Thatcher believed in a small state, meaning that the government should have limited power over the lives of its people.
When Thatcher was in charge of education, she stopped the milk for all children above age 7.
In order to increase this competition, Thatcher took harsh measures against what she considered to be underperforming industries, like coal mining, but encouraged the growth of industries that she thought to be more profitable, like banking.
Industries in Britain, like in most other countries, are grouped in certain regions.
But her policies also meant the widespread closure of large numbers of coal mines, factories and shipyards, which were mostly located in northern England, Scotland and Wales.
The territory of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean is still disputed between Britain and Argentina.
In 1982, Argentina invaded the islands and Thatcher responded with British military forces.
By working together, Reagan, Thatcher and Gorbachev helped end the Cold War peacefully.
The Cold War, a period of political and military tension between the U.S. and its allies against the USSR and its allies, had raged for a few decades.

In Paslang, a farming village where most homes were damaged or destroyed, residents said the quake killed two buffalo and a goat when the tin roofs of their sheds collapsed.
It is coordinating with organizations such as Humane Society International to bring in veterinarians, food supplies and vaccines and medicines for sick and injured animals.
Contaminated water supplies and loss of barns, and the shock of the disaster, can put cows, goats and other farm animals at risk for respiratory ailments, hoof disease and other problems.
"You can spend a day getting to just three or four villages, and there are thousands of villages \u2014 it\'s not like other places where we\'ve recently had earthquakes, like Haiti," he said.
"If people are homeless and can\'t care for their animals, we need to help," he said.
The aim is to care for pets for a few months and then reunite as many as possible with their owners.
The three dogs have been in an animal hospital for days.
Elsewhere in Nepal, many pets and livestock that survived the earthquake are homeless.
The group Animal Welfare Network Nepal (AWNN) is trying to address the problem.
Usually, farmers own two large animals, such as cows, and around 10 small ones, such as goats.
The three dogs have been in an animal hospital for days.
Joshi said he hopes to get to the dogs by Monday.

Years earlier, Clifford photographed what he now believes to have been a 15th-century wrought-iron lombard or cannon.
"There are only seven lombards that have been found in the Western world," Clifford said.
The Santa Maria drifted into a reef and had to be abandoned.
"There is a lot of water, a lot of history around Haiti, and there have been many, many shipwrecks along the coast of Haiti," said Koski-Karell.

"It was where Christopher Columbus said it would be," Barry said.
On Aug. 3, 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail to the New World.
Now, an underwater explorer says he is certain that he has found the long-lost ship.

Encyclopaedia Britannica is looking to regain its place as the king of reference libraries.
"Whenever Britannica appears on search engines, we have a pretty amazing click-through rate," he said.
The company owns Britannica.com, Merriam-Webster.com and more than 20 other websites.
Book sales fell when people began getting their information online.
The company was sold in late 1995 to a businessman, who ended its door-to-door sales.
Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia website written by volunteers, has nearly 4.6 million articles in English.
Cauz said Britannica could make hundreds of millions of dollars from online ads.
A Google search for Abraham Lincoln, for example, came up with nearly 3.5 million results.
The ads include everything from Home Depot to a Chicago law office.

President Barack Obama on Tuesday promised more than $33 billion in public and private investments in Africa.
Obama made the remarks as he addressed the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, the first of its kind and the largest event any American president has held with African leaders.
Other nations are already deeply invested in the continent, and the United States now realizes "we have some catching up to do \u2026 we are letting Europe and China go faster than the U.S.," said former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Africa, he said, still has its "hot spots," but many of its 53 countries have changed over the past decade, with leaders endorsing strong economic and political policies.
Corruption in a number of countries hampers the United States to the benefit of countries like China, said Andrew Spalding, an expert on international business and corruption.
However, "the African market is so large and there\'s such an opportunity there and there\'s so many different needs that I think it\'s really about how do we get more U.S. companies into the continent."
"If you\'re running a country, you\'ve got to try to create an opportunity for all of your businesses to be competitive," Clinton said.
On Tuesday, President Barack Obama promised that more than $33 billion would be directed to Africa.
"We recognize Africa for its greatest resource, which is its people."
"That\'s the kind of partnership America offers."

As an undergraduate at UCLA in the 1970s, Helen Singleton often visited the student union building.
It was also a self-portrait of sorts, showing eight people staring at the interior of Ackerman Union, their faces and hair made up of small images of famous African-Americans.
But a few phone calls revealed that a wall had been placed in front of the mural and that it was probably undamaged.
"It\'s what happens when you have people eating nearby," said Elizabeth Drolet, a conservator at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County who worked on the project.
The mural was officially unveiled last Wednesday at a ceremony attended by Angela Davis, Singleton and Neville Garrick, another student who had worked on the mural.
As a college student at UCLA in the 1970s, Helen Singleton often visited the student union building.
A wall stood in its place.
The killings set off more protests across the country.
Small images from those photos and many others became a collage filling most of the mural.
Over the years, the building became home to new chain and student-run restaurants and seating areas.
In 1970, Helen Singleton and six other students painted a mural on a wall in the student union building at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
She and UCLA tried to find others pictured in the mural but could not track them down.

Scientists call it "the blob," and say it\'s responsible for the dead seabirds and starving sea lion pups washing up on California beaches.
At the center of this debate is a poorly understood pattern of wind, ocean current and temperature variations.
Scientists believe that the Pacific Ocean began a cold phase in the late 1990s, which was largely responsible for an unexpected slowdown in global temperatures.
In the simplest sense, a warm spell is El Nino-friendly, whereas a cool shift is El Nino-repellent, according to Patzert.
One of the hallmarks of a warm PDO is the gathering of warm waters along the Pacific Coast of North America, a situation very similar to the blob.
Scientists first described the PDO in 1997, after investigating the question of why Pacific salmon populations could flourish for years on end, then mysteriously disappear.
They identified a recurring pattern that either cooled waters along the Pacific Coast, or warmed them.
Although climatologists and oceanographers agree that PDO shifts are a fact of life, not all agree that the blob means the weather will change immediately.
He believes the warm mass of water is better explained by a region of high pressure over the northeast Pacific Ocean.
At Scripps Institution of Oceanography, climate researcher Dan Cayan said he was not sure what the blob signaled about the future.
"The thing that history tells us is that every situation is somewhat different," he said.

Michelle Obama has steered clear of most messy legislative battles.', u'But on Tuesday the first lady publicly took on lawmakers, food companies and lunch ladies who say the school lunch law she championed nearly four years ago is leading kids to brown bag it.
She suggested they were trying to "roll back everything we have worked for."
She said, "It\'s unacceptable to me not just as first lady, but also as a mother."
She has largely sought to work with the food industry and around Congress in her campaign against [childhood obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity).
A House committee is to vote Thursday on a provision that would allow school districts that have been operating at a loss to seek a one-year exemption from the nutrition guidelines.
Meanwhile, they say, they have watched students throw away large amounts of the healthy food that land on their trays.
This temporary one-year waiver simply throws them a lifeline," said Brian Rell, a spokesman for Republican Rep. Robert B. Aderholt of Alabama, chairman of the agriculture subcommittee, which approved the provision last week.
White House officials helped with a letter by former presidents of the School Nutrition Association opposing the exemption plan.
Officials argued against having lawmakers determine what is healthy, noting that lawmakers have bent to food industry complaints in the past, such as an effort in 2011 to classify pizza with tomato sauce as a vegetable.
"What we\'re not going to do is put politics and interests ahead of what\'s good for our kids and allow politicians to set nutrition standards," said Sam Kass, director of the first lady\'s anti-obesity campaign.
But he said its "hard line" on the law did not reflect his views.
Binkle said he had not had trouble procuring food that meets the federal guidelines or stricter local nutrition standards.

"If we would get serious about addressing the actual economic and social issues that we find so off-putting, we wouldn\'t need meters," said Paul Boden, director of a homelessness advocacy group.
He called the meter programs stupid and said they are designed to help cities push out the homeless.
Underneath an eye patch, her eye is red and swollen from infection.
Women living outdoors are especially unsafe, she said, and panhandling money could pay for a hotel room where she could sleep without fear of sexual assault.
Officials claim the meters have cut down on panhandling and they have raised more than $30,000 annually for food, housing and therapy for the homeless.
In other cities, the results have been more modest.
The Pasadena meter campaign was designed by a class of students at the Art Center College of Design at a cost of about $350,000 and was paid for by grants from corporations.
Fourteen repurposed parking meters across the city will collect change for nonprofits that help the homeless.
"Homeless people wouldn\'t be out there doing that if they didn\'t really need it," said Edwards, who found permanent housing in 2011 after a city worker approached her.

"What\'s funny is the team was a small [part] of me coming back," James said.
"It had nothing much to do with the team, it was more about these fans and the city and the people here and the people who watched me grow from when I first picked up a basketball at age 8 to now at 29."
The night James left Cleveland, "people in here were running into the streets crying and screaming," Harry Buffalo General Manager Caitlin Cassidy said.
"When he announced he was coming back, people did not go back to work."
"There are not many players who can come in that young and understand the magnitude of what he stands for and what he brings," said Dallas Mavericks veteran Tyson Chandler, who won a gold medal with James during the 2012 London Olympics.
"But if there is someone who can do it, he can."
"It\'s the hardest thing you can ever do in your basketball career," James says now.
James stopped caring how others viewed his career about the time he stopped listening to social media and started listening to Roosevelt.

Girl Scouts and local companies are teaming up to reduce the gender gap within science, technology, engineering and math (together known as STEM).
Meanwhile, women in STEM jobs earn 33 percent more than in other fields.
"We could actually be doing what\'s fun, and make more money and be doing better for ourselves and our families," Stanley explains.
The report found that an encouraging 74 percent of high school girls were interested in STEM subjects.

Yet SquashSmarts is among 15 clubs nationwide using the game to help underprivileged students through exercise and school support.
"The (basic idea) is inch-wide, mile-deep," said Tim Wyant, executive director of the National Urban Squash and Education Association in New York.
The number of players grew from about 600,000 in 2007 to nearly 1.3 million in 2012, according to a survey by the Sports &amp; Fitness Industry Association.
Today, many squash lovers "enjoy seeing the (population) of the game change," Wyant said.
Over the next 10 years, the idea spread to Philadelphia and both Bronx and Harlem in New York City.
Had that not occurred, "it may have been harder to get access to these facilities," Klipstein said.

Mexicans would pay an extra peso (7.6 cents) for every liter of sugary drinks they buy.
They would also pay a tax on flavored drinks, powders and syrups.
Many countries are calling for taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages.
France, Finland, Algeria and Hungary all tax sugary drinks.
Critics made fun of it as part of an over-reaching "nanny state."
"A 10 percent increase in the price should result in a 10 to 12 percent decrease in consumption," said Roberta R. Friedman of Yale University.
Friedman said soft drink consumption has been linked to obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, dental disease and gout.
The tax only amounts to about 10 percent of the cost of a soda bottle.

In what may be a first for a long-extinct nonhuman animal, scientists have assembled the genome \u2014 the complete set of genes \u2014 of the woolly mammoth.
The Wrangel Island mammoths are particularly interesting because they were among the last surviving members of their species.
To figure out if that was true, the team first had to find woolly mammoth bits well-preserved enough to study.
Eventually they chose two things: soft tissue from a young male that lived in northeastern Siberia around 44,800 years ago, and a large tooth from a Wrangel Island male mammoth that lived about 4,300 years ago.
For the first time, scientists have pieced together the complete set of genes \u2014 the genome \u2014 of the long-extinct woolly mammoth.
The study could help scientists understand why species die out, and if genetic factors have to do with it, Palkopoulou said.
"Your genome is like your tool kit for getting out of trouble," said biologist Ian Barnes.
"Some individuals will die when the environment changes or a disease arrives, but there will probably be others that will be resistant and will pass those genes on to the next generation.
Genes shape the way you look and the way your body acts.
Genes help make you who you are.
For the first time, scientists have pieced together the complete set of genes \u2014 the genome \u2014 of the long-extinct woolly mammoth.
An international team of scientists reported their findings in a study published Thursday.
The other lived much earlier on mainland Siberia.
They died out only 4,000 years ago, some 6,000 years after their relatives vanished from mainland Siberia.
The team wanted to see if the Wrangel Island mammoths had less genetic diversity \u2014 fewer available genes \u2014 than their mainland Siberian ancestors.
DNA can be thought of as a set of instructions that makes each species \u2014 and each individual \u2014 what it is.
The more varied the DNA of a particular animal population, the more likely it is that population will be able to survive.
To test their theory, the team first had to find woolly mammoth bits well-preserved enough to study.

Instead, it displayed a rap lyric that made reference to the very spot Castillo had just blown past.
After about 15 minutes, Castillo held one of his most treasured pieces of street art.
Growing up in the suburbs of New York, Shelowitz was surrounded by music; he and his friends drove into the city to see live hip-hop, and as they got older, some became DJs and producers.
But by then, the treasure hunt had already begun, and most of the signs were gone.
A bright red sign with white text stared him in the face, clasped to the streetlight pole in front of the sneaker store Flight Club.
It had the look of a standard street sign, but it offered no instructions on parking, driving or walking.
Rappers including Murs, Action Bronson and Lupe Fiasco have given big ups to the project via social media, sometimes posting pictures of their signs on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter.
Soon he was sending mass emails and requests on social media asking for any rap lyric that mentioned a location.

There are also plans to hire several people with autism to aid in the process.
When it became clear that their feedback was highly positive, Jackson says, it helped solidify his belief that the chair could benefit children on a widespread scale.
For Jackson, whose son, Joshua, is severely autistic, the project has also taken on a personal significance.

Food dyes have been controversial since studies in the 1970s suggested a link between artificial colors and hyperactive behavior, but scientists, consumers and the government have not yet reached an agreement on the extent of this risk or the correct path to address it.
The FDA held a meeting in 2011 to review the research, and concluded that there was not enough evidence proving that foods with artificial colors caused hyperactivity in the general population.
The FDA also decided that further research was needed, and that a warning label was unnecessary.
But Joel Nigg, professor of psychiatry, pediatrics and behavioral neuroscience at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, says the studies support the link between dyes and hyperactivity.
"Do you want to take a chance that these initial studies are wrong and put kids at risk, or do you want to take a chance that they\'re right?
However, Nigg says this is likely because removing processed foods in general is healthier and results in better behavioral outcomes for children with ADHD.
They are 2 of the 9 certified colors that food manufacturers must list on ingredient labels.

The FDA approved them for use in 1969 and 1986, respectively.
An April 2015 study looked at how much dye was in recommended servings of processed foods; it found Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese contained 17.6 milligrams of Yellow Nos.
Because the chemicals are so similar in color, and difficult to tell apart in measurements, the researchers chose the dye with the highest concentration.

U.S. planes began flying missions over northeastern Nigeria trying to trace the girls, according to newspapers.
The newspaper cited several other parents who also did not see their children on the video.
In the video, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said he was willing to exchange some of the girls for Boko Haram prisoners held by Nigeria.
The Nigerian government has said it will do everything necessary to free the girls, but it did not specify whether it would be willing to organize a prisoner exchange with the group, which is designated a terror organization by the U.S. government.
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan asked the government to extend a state of emergency in the area.

In the Logan Square schools, principals and teachers credit the parents with helping many students improve in math and reading.
They also believe parents contribute in harder-to-measure but equally important areas such as student motivation.
Before the program started, a few Funston parents would show up to help each day, but the principal wanted to attract others.
The hope was that teachers would learn as much from parents as parents would gain from watching and talking with teachers.

In a cave about 75 miles from Los Angeles, a new reality TV show has unfolded.
He stares at his toes, lifting each one in turn as though playing a piano.
Scientists and volunteers could only speculate on what was happening in the caves and hollowed-out redwood trees where condors live and lay one egg a year.
In Missoula, Montana, cameras placed in an osprey nest help identify the species of fish the birds are bringing home from a nearby river.
In late October, the young condor failed to return from one of its first flights from the nest.
Fish and Wildlife Service, is making the nest significantly safer for birds and scientists alike.
"Prior to video, we routinely entered condor nests every 30 days to collect the harmful micro-trash they bring home," said Joseph Brandt, a condor biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service.
Scientists also took blood samples and vaccinated the birds for West Nile virus.
Condor nests are in remote areas, which makes transmitting video difficult.
The video is streamed to researchers, and later edited and archived at the Santa Barbara Zoo.
Development disturbed the condor habitat, and the now-banned pesticide DDT made condor eggshells so thin they often could not support life.
Some of the birds were shot or died of lead poisoning when they ate the bodies of other animals killed with lead shot and bullets.
Scientists began recovery efforts by capturing the few remaining wild condors, breeding them in captivity and releasing them back into the wild.
Without major setbacks, the vulture may be eligible for down-listing from endangered to threatened within a few decades, researchers say.
On a recent weekday, Brandt, Astelle and Devon Pryor, a conservation and research associate at the Santa Barbara Zoo, released three adult condors into the mountains of Ventura County.
With black-and-white wings flapping hard, they rose into the brilliant blue sky.
Like all California condors, they had been fitted with number tags and radio transmitters to allow scientists to track their movements.

A nurse who took care of the first Ebola patient to die in the United States has come down with the disease.
The director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Sunday that the infection in the nurse resulted from a "breach in protocol."
The CDC has sent additional staff members to Dallas, he said.
"Unfortunately, it is possible in the coming days we will see additional cases of Ebola" in health care workers, he said.
Texas Health Commissioner David Lakey said the nurse had "extensive contact" with Duncan.
He was sent home with antibiotics only to return to the hospital on Sept. 28.
She was just an innocent woman who took care of someone who was sick," said neighbor Colleen Watson.

The rest look suspiciously like other species, and poisonous species at that.
But while mimicry has long been studied, it is still a mystery just how it becomes restricted to females of a species.
In this butterfly, in this one species at least, it is just one gene."
Exactly what mutations may be responsible for which colors remains a mystery.
Other broad questions remain, too.
"Basically what the butterflies have done is they have grabbed this mechanism that they already use to tell males from females," Kronforst said.

"Lead sowed the seeds of their future," said Kim Dietrich, a neuropsychologist who has been following the group of nearly 300 people since they were born in the late 1970s.
Sampson recently added information on lead to his research on poverty, education and crime in Chicago neighborhoods.
A map of lead poisoning rates among children younger than 6 in 1995, for instance, looks very similar to a map of assault rates in 2012, when those children were 17 to 22 years old.
The link between childhood lead exposure and violent behavior is well-established, both in animal research and human studies.
A hospital machine scanned the brains of a group of young adults.
As children, they struggled in school more than those who had not been around lead.

Some people know that kids exposed to lead as toddlers are more likely to act out.
Frogs and toads are at the center of a fight in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California.
Fish and Wildlife leaders say they are not planning to shut down forests.
The service also proposed setting aside 1.83 million acres of critical habitat for the amphibians.
The areas are considered essential for the frogs and toads to live.
But the U.S. Forest Service plans were designed to protect large, old trees.
Most lumber mills closed in this part of the mountain range.
They said there may be a misunderstanding about the lands labeled a critical habitat.
More than 300 types of plants and animals are under federal protection in California.
Supporters of nature and some scientists have been pushing for 10 years to list the Sierra amphibians under the Endangered Species Act.
The animals have been dying way too fast over the past 20 years, say biologists.

"There is history in those plants, and [the youth] are carrying it genetically forward," said Diane Wilson, executive director of the nonprofit, as she watched the teens pulling up vegetables.
In 2003, the nonprofit purchased a 10-acre farm outside the city of Hugo in Washington County, and began its agricultural and health care experiment.
Baker died, but the seeds kept coming.
The groups had a big task before them.
The farm also grows organic vegetables, which its teenage Garden Warriors were harvesting last week.

It was exciting for the new organization, like opening a time capsule.
Ten years later, the farm is planted with vegetables, tobacco and medicinal plants that were a part of life for native Minnesotans.
But the nonprofit relies heavily on its youth to lead the charge against fast foods and bad food.
And if they do, perhaps those memories "will shape their lives, so they can be healthy adults and raise healthy families."
At first glance, the small farm near Lino Lakes, Minn., looks much like other farms in the area.
The project took off when a package of seeds arrived from an elderly Potawatomi woman named Cora Baker.

For many, the second time around features a mixture of touting accomplishments while listing what is important for a second term.
Emanuel listed a number of programs he said had made a difference for kids from low-income families, and pointed to examples of students who have overcome such situations.
That included the story of Marcus Norris, who was sitting in his house as a 9-year-old when a "gunshot came through the window and knocked out four of his teeth."
His dream is to enter a college (cooking) program and one day become a chef," Emanuel said.
"Their existence is avoided rather than confronted."

Corner stores and small supermarkets that feed vast swaths, or areas, of impoverished Philadelphia offer bacteria-laced foods in unhealthy conditions, a Drexel University study shows.
For years, advocates for the poor have been trying to get fruits, vegetables and other staples into so-called food deserts like North Philadelphia.
Recent estimates show that of 9.4 million cases of foodborne illness in the United States in a year, fewer than 1,500 resulted in death.
For example, many corner-store owners get milk from larger stores, and transport it in their own cars, scientists at Yale University found.
However, she added, from a microbiologist\'s viewpoint, "if people can\'t store and keep food safely, you\'re not doing them any favors getting them that food."
"Potatoes and baby food are moldy, lettuce is rotten, and the mice are having a good time in boxes of noodles," said Rodney Jenkins, 47.

A customer then finds the milk goes bad much sooner than expiration dates show.
Because the smell of spoiled milk keeps anyone from drinking it, the result is not foodborne illness but wasted dollars, Quinlan said.
Poor people realize that they have few options in protecting themselves from bad food.
However, from a microbiologist\'s viewpoint, "if people can\'t store and keep food safely, you\'re not doing them any favors getting them that food," she said.

Americans should be wary of Washington\'s growing tendency to make every project a priority simply by adding the word "security" to the issue.
So when our government says it wants to focus on climate security, energy security, food security \u2014 what it is really saying is that the government plans to step in and take over.
The challenge of keeping Ebola from becoming a global problem is not mainly a security problem.
Be it sandbagging during storms or delivering supplies and rescue services after disaster strikes, our military is skilled at assisting in non-military emergencies.
The right measure of these missions is whether or not they are suitable, possible and acceptable.
The best way to keep more Ebola cases from checking in at the nearest Holiday Inn is to help defeat the outbreak at its source.

The lizards will eat just about anything, including small mammals, birds, insects, plants, and their all-time favorite \u2014 eggs.
It could also mean lights out for the endangered Key Largo wood rat, not to mention other native creatures.
Eckles and others, who track them, say they often find tegus out in the open during the hottest time of day.
The animals hibernate in burrows from October until about January or February, then emerge once again to search for food and reproduce.
Tegus are easiest to trap using eggs as bait, according to Jake Edwards, a wildlife technician hired by FWC to capture the lizards.
Asked whether he was concerned that the pets he sells may end up right back in the Everglades abandoned by their owners, Irwin responded that none of his customers are local.
"When we first found out about them in 2008, we thought we had a chance to nip this population in the bud," said the National Park Service\'s Tony Pernas.

"When we first found out about them in 2008, we thought we had a chance to nip this population in the bud," said Tony Pernas.
But the numbers definitely are on the rise.
Scientists and wildlife managers mainly worry that the black-and-white tegus will spread to neighboring Everglades National Park, where a handful of them have already been caught.

Within the next year, it will have enough data to be able to determine its next steps.
These were found mainly on public lands, according to Eckles.

The Republican lawmaker who helped trigger the gridlock took credit in a message to supporters that also sought donations to his presidential campaign.
In a rare Sunday session, they abandoned their opposition to the House bill in the face of pressure from the president and senior intelligence officials to pass it quickly.
"We call on the Senate to ensure this irresponsible lapse in authorities is as short-lived as possible," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.
What they most fear is a legislative deadlock that could doom the programs permanently.
However, it became stalled in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other leading Republicans sought changes.
"We\'ll have a vote on that legislation as soon as we can," he said.
However, he pointedly did not rule out changes.
But with no other options, McConnell, in a change of mind, reluctantly embraced the House-passed bill Sunday night.

President Barack Obama laid a wreath at the World War I memorial at Flanders Field in Belgium on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Obama repeated threats of more painful economic sanctions, or penalties, if Russian President Vladimir Putin sends troops into other regions of Ukraine.
Other European nations are worried about the effect that deeper sanctions would have on their own fragile economies.
Obama, Belgian King Philippe and Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo placed wreaths at a monument erected to the missing dead.
"Our countries have learned the hard way that national sovereignty quickly reaches its limits when met with heavily armed adversaries," the king said.

During World War II, Tom Jones Jr. served as one of the legendary Navajo code talkers.
"My desire is a house where I can be able to get around, to have a heating system so I can sleep well and enjoy life," Jones said in the Native language of Dine, which he spoke for the Allies through the war.
"There is a huge crisis taking place in our nation," said Rick Abasta, spokesman for Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly.
And a $6-million trust fund for Navajo veterans created by the tribe allowed the launch of a home-building program in 1998.
There is a long list \u2014 in the hundreds \u2014 of veterans who are waiting for housing.

At Jones\' house she has placed a sign out front: "Navajo Code Talker Needs a New Home."
When the military asked him to join 73 years ago, Jones said, he was told that he would have whatever he needed after the war.
The aim was to provide free houses to veterans in need or help them pay for home repairs.

Caribbean countries face plenty of problems, including rising unemployment, high crime and a health crisis.
For decades, cultural leaders, black scholars and others across the United States, Caribbean and Africa have unsuccessfully sought reparations from Britain, France and the Netherlands.
"It\'s a historic wrong that has to be righted," Gonsalves said.
But if Europeans are willing to listen, their governments may not be so inclined.
Aristide, who was forced into exile months later, had sent Paris a bill for the amount, down to the last penny, of $21,685,135,571.48.
Attempts to have the courts force the U.S. to pay reparations or to make good on the 40 acres and a mule promised to former slaves after the Civil War ended in 1865 have gone nowhere.

ICAGO, Ill. - Eight-year-old Claire Dormanen embraced her role as a summer camper this month in all the typical ways: She wore a comfy T-shirt and shorts, ate a sack lunch, and ran to avoid getting hit in a game of dodgeball.
"For me, the idea of having kids coding at 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years old is just absurd," said Jim Taylor, a professor of psychology at the University of San Francisco.
Proponents believe that children should learn coding for several reasons.
"It\'s not that kids should be learning this because they want to work at Google and Microsoft and Facebook," Lazowska said.
Within weeks of adding code/sports summer camps for kindergartners through sixth-graders, nearly all 70 available spots were filled.
After lunch, campers fill up water bottles, fasten their sneakers and spend the afternoon playing soccer, dodgeball, and other fast-paced games.
At any time of the day, campers can head to a classroom filled with iPads to play a video game that teaches coding or use a program to develop their own apps.
By offering coding alongside bread-making, dance, water slides and music, the camp is able to provide valuable technological lessons without the complicated process that comes with changing school programs, Chun added.
Hintch said she could understand why the parents of children who are always behind a computer might not like coding at camp.
It\'s really a good thing."

Coding was once only for students who wanted to work in the tech industry.
The new option appears next to the more traditional camp activities like arts and crafts, soccer and rock climbing.
It also meets the new demand from parents who are eager to expose their children to the latest technology and careers in STEM fields: science, technology, engineering and math.
Some parents and experts question the need to teach children how to code.

For years, football helmets have had to meet a simple standard.
His Pennsylvania-based company, Unequal Technologies, sells Kevlar-fortified pads meant to be added to a helmet\'s inner cushioning, which he derides as "couch foam."
He said his products act like a trampoline: It disperses the energy of a blow across a wide surface area and reduces the severity of the impact.
Some, including Riddell and Schutt, have said they will do just that.

Black holes are regions of space with a very strong gravitational pull.
Astronomers have known for years that black holes also shoot matter into the universe.
However, nobody knew exactly what type of material was in the jets.
Now, that mystery may have been solved.
Everyone agreed that the jets would contain electrons, which have a negative charge.
Some models of the jets suggested they were shooting lightweight electrons and positrons from the black hole into the universe.
They thought the jets were made of much heavier normal matter.
It takes much more energy to move normal matter than to move lightweight electrons and positrons.
Black holes can grow \u2014 or "feed" \u2014 by sucking in matter around them.
But the second time the team looked, the radio waves seemed to show the jets were on.
At the same time, the X-ray spectrum picked up the signatures of iron and nickel.
A whopping 123,000 miles per second, or about two-thirds of the speed of light.
Black holes are strange and mysterious regions of outer space.
Now, the mystery may have been solved.
But the jets do not have a negative charge overall.
It takes much more energy than it it does to move lightweight electrons and positrons.
The first time the researchers looked, the jets were not on.
But the second time the team looked, the jets were on.
Black holes are strange and mysterious regions of outer space.

SHINGTON - The U.S. Justice Department sued North Carolina on Monday over a new state law that forces people to present a photo identification before voting and that limits early voting.
It was the second time in recent months that the Democratic Obama administration has challenged a voting law in a Republican-led state.
The North Carolina law is one of a series enacted in Republican-governed states imposing new voting requirements.
Democrats say that the laws are intended to make it harder for blacks and other people who are likely to vote Democratic cast their ballots.
"Common practices like boarding an airplane and purchasing Sudafed (a common decongestant) require photo ID, and we should expect nothing less for the protection of our right to vote," he said then.
Civil rights advocates say recent changes echo the earlier, century-long fight to win voting rights for black Americans in the U.S. South.
The federal government will have to prove that discrimination was both the intent behind the North Carolina law and its effect.
The Justice Department has approved of them in some states such as Virginia that take steps to ensure that IDs are available at little to no cost.
The case was assigned to a federal judge in Winston-Salem, N.C.
SHINGTON - The U.S. Justice Department sued North Carolina on Monday over a new state voting law.
Democrats say that the laws are meant to make it harder for blacks and other people who are likely to vote Democratic cast their ballots.
Civil rights groups filed suit against the law immediately after it was signed.
More than 70 percent of blacks who voted in the November 2008 and 2012 elections in North Carolina voted early, according to the Justice Department.
"I believe that North Carolina is in the mainstream on this issue, and it\'s the Justice Department that\'s working in the fringes," he said.
Civil rights groups filed suit immediately after it was signed in August.
SHINGTON - The U.S. Justice Department sued North Carolina on Monday over a new state voting law.
Holder said the North Carolina law imposes several "troubling new restrictions" on voters.
Democrats say that the laws are meant to make it harder for blacks and other people who are likely to vote Democratic cast their ballots.
Holder said he was especially troubled that the law would shorten the early voting period.
Civil rights advocates say recent changes echo the earlier fight to win voting rights for black Americans in the U.S. South.
That part of the law prohibits state voting rules that discriminate by race.
Those states take steps to ensure that IDs are available at little to no cost.
But it has opposed the rules in states where it said the rule would be hard on the poor and minorities.
Attorney General Eric Holder argues the measure discriminates against black people and other minorities.
Holder said the North Carolina law places several "troubling new restrictions" on voters.
"We should expect nothing less for the protection of our right to vote," he added.
Voters fill out those ballots when there are questions about whether they can actually vote; *   -- and the adoption of an ID rule that is stricter than the Justice Department allows.
Requiring voters to have a state ID has been a major issue.
Those states take steps to make sure that IDs are available at little to no cost.
Holder said the North Carolina law places several "troubling" new rules on voters.
They stop cheating, Republicans say.
The U.S. government had previously used the law to challenge state voting rules.
Voters fill out those ballots when there are questions about whether they can actually vote; *   -- the voter ID rule.
Civil rights supporters say recent changes remind them of the earlier fight to win voting rights for blacks in the U.S. South.
The federal government will have to prove two things to win the lawsuit.

The agency has held an annual spring survey since 2002, collecting numbers on sightings around the state.
If the blood was removed, it would do the same thing, meaning it could be used as a "fire alarm" to detect similar threats to humans.
The birds precisely time their pit stop to when the crabs are spawning.
That means they circle the couple and help fertilize the eggs, according to University of Florida researcher Jane Brockmann, who has spent 25 years studying the crabs in the Cedar Keys National Wildlife Refuge.
Every spring, thousands of horseshoe crabs make their way ashore when the moon is bright.
Bounties were sometimes placed on its helmeted head to stop it from eating clams.
And in the mid-1800s, between 1.5 million and 2 million were caught yearly to use as fertilizer and livestock feed.
"They basically reduced harvests along the coast to address the fact that birds need the eggs," said Marin Hawk, who oversees the states\' fishing plans.
Every spring, thousands of horseshoe crabs swim to the shore when the moon is bright.
The crabs are caught and their hearts pierced to drain about a third of their blood before they are tossed back into the sea.
Each year, the female crab can lay up to 90,000 eggs.
Every spring, thousands of horseshoe crabs make their way ashore when the moon is bright.
Since 2002, people have reported spotting crabs a total of 2,800 times.
And in the mid-1800s, between 1.5 million and 2 million were caught yearly to use as fertilizer and livestock feed.
But a recent study found that it may slow down the females and make it harder for them to make the long swim toward shore.

Even if the blood was removed from the crab, the blood would still clot if it was poisoned.
The 18-foot giant found on Oct. 13 was among the largest oarfish reported in nearly 20 years.
But, results from the research could take years to complete, scientists said.
Staff members at the Catalina Island Marine Institute considered burying their 18-foot oarfish body, which was too large to refrigerate.
The fish was divided among different laboratories because there was so much interest, he said.
"Social media allows us to distribute those, and get information back to scientists.
One claim is that an oarfish dying is a sign of a coming earthquake.
Experts, however, stressed that they have not pinpointed a cause of death yet.
Back home in Afghanistan, a country in Central Asia, Salim lives with his parents.
Since arriving in the United States, Salim has had an operation on his left arm.
In 2014, he was chosen by Solace for the Children to come to the Hanger Clinic in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Hanger is known for helping people who have lost limbs.
Scar tissue had also formed, leaving him with limited range of motion.
In late August, the doctors operated.
Recently, Salim and his host mother, Tabor-Gray, went back to see Gaston and Jenks, so they could remove his stitches and make sure everything was healing properly.
Salim, who speaks a kind of Persian called Dari, but also understands and speaks some English, smiled shyly.
He politely agreed when Gaston asked him to move his arm forward, back, up and down.
Solace for the Children was launched in 1997 by Dick and Patsy Wilson to provide medical care, dentists and eye doctors for children in war-torn countries.
Each summer, a group of children travels to the United States for six weeks.
In Kabul, Afghanistan, Salim lives with his parents, six brothers, aunts, uncles and cousins.
Salim was fitted with a prosthetic, a man-made arm.
This year, Salim returned because his prosthetic arm no longer fit.
Gaston asked Salim as he walked into the exam room.
Each summer, Solace for the Children brings a group of children to the United States.
She and her husband have hosted 10 children, including Salim, and she has traveled to Afghanistan twice.
"We teach them, you are brothers and sisters of one country.
Salim will be in the United States for a few more weeks before returning to his family in Afghanistan.
For example, Salim was left-handed before his accident.
Salim lives with his mother and father, six brothers and lots of family in Afghanistan.
In 2014, he was chosen by Solace for the Children to come to the Hanger Clinic.
Salim was fitted with a prosthetic, a man-made arm.
The trip costs $6,000 to $8,000 for each child.
Salim will be in the United States for a few more weeks before returning to his family in Afghanistan.
Asked how he feels about Tabor-Gray, Salim answered through a translator.

Obama used the fair as an opportunity to encourage more students to study STEM subjects in school.
Additionally, more than 100 colleges and universities have committed to training 20,000 new engineers, and a group of companies have promised to expand high-quality STEM education programs to an additional 1.5 million students this year.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump often speaks of the deportation efforts of the Eisenhower administration in the 1950s.
He did so again during the Republican debate on Nov. 10, saying "you don\'t get nicer, you don\'t get friendlier" than President Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose nickname Ike appeared on "I Like Ike" campaign buttons in his 1952 race for the White House.
The 1954 program was aimed at apprehending and deporting agricultural workers who had crossed the border illegally looking for work.
According to a summary of the project from the Texas State Historical Association, the United States Border Patrol began an "operation of search and seizure of all unauthorized immigrants."
The project, Ngai said, began with 750 government officers, who used jeeps, trucks, buses and airplanes to capture migrants nationwide, including in the cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.
They caught 3,000 people a day and 170,000 during its first three months.
Many of the migrants were transported in crowded buses and dumped on the other side of the border in a manner some at the time compared to the treatment of livestock.
In one incident, Ngai said, 88 apprehended Mexicans died of sunstroke after being exposed to 112-degree heat.
Trump has yet to explain precisely how he would find those living in the country illegally, or how he would determine "the good ones" whom he would allow to return.

Trump did not call the program by name on Nov. 11 in an interview on "The O\'Reilly Factor," a television talk show.
"He\'s only got part of the story," said Mae Ngai, a professor of history at Columbia University in New York.
At one point, a group of prisoners rebelled on a ship sending them back to Mexico.
However, Trump praised the program during the Republican debate on Nov. 10.
Hundreds of thousands of Mexican farmworkers did enter the country legally under the program.
Trump included both those who chose to leave the country as well as people who returned after being deported and were sent away again.
He also has not said how he would determine "the good ones" whom he would allow to return.

Along the way, he stopped to accept a pain pill from one nurse.
Both legs had been removed by an overworked doctor in Syria.
It has been praised as a triumph of generosity over politics.
The 9-year-old boy is one of 17 Syrians being treated at Rebecca Sieff Hospital in Safed, Israel.
The kids hung on him as he talked and grabbed at his big hands.
In that war, Syria tried, but failed to take back the Golan Heights.
It had lost this territory to Israel six years earlier.

In the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said there was no reason for Russia to invade Ukraine.
Russia has long wanted to take back the lush Crimean peninsula, which was part of Russia until 1954.
He also said he had ordered stepped-up security at nuclear power plants, airports and other strategic places.
Ukraine is not a NATO member, which means the U.S. and Europe are not obliged to come to its defense.
Kerry said he spoke with foreign ministers for G-8 and other nations on Saturday, and says everyone is prepared "to go to the hilt" to isolate Russia.
The new Ukrainian government came to power last week following months of pro-democracy protests against a pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, and his decision to turn Ukraine toward Russia.
Since then, tensions have risen sharply between the two countries.
"(But) it is still possible to turn around.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said there was no reason for Russia to invade Ukraine.

The Brontosaurus is back from the dead.
"Generally, Brontosaurus can be distinguished from Apatosaurus most easily by its neck, which is higher and less wide," said study author Emanuel Tschopp.
"We\'re delighted that Brontosaurus is back," said Jacques Gauthier, curator of vertebrate paleontology and zoology at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History.
"The Late Jurassic of North America in which they lived may have been a weird time," Wedel said.
In other words, research that helped bring back the Brontosaurus may have given scientists new mysteries to solve.
The Brontosaurus died out millions of years ago.
The first Brontosaurus was named in 1879 by Othniel Charles Marsh.
In 1903, another paleontologist decided that the Brontosaurus was the same as another dinosaur called the Apatosaurus.
He is a paleontologist at the New University of Lisbon in Portugal.
It was published online April 7 in PeerJ, a magazine for scientists.
Mary Fallin has someone dedicated to attracting drone companies to the state.
"This bill will harm any opportunity Maine has to create new jobs in the aerospace industry," LePage wrote.
Officials from several state governments wrote a model drone policy that urges states to require a warrant before drones can watch an individual; prohibit the re-use of video or photos collected by a drone for other investigations; and ban weapons from drones used in the U.S.
He said it was "the wrong message to send if we want these jobs."
Congress has directed the FAA to safely add drones into the national airspace by 2015.
He says that Amazon hopes to use drones to make same-day deliveries within five years of FAA approval.
The Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) represents drone makers.
Recently, eight states put limits on how police can use drones.
Still, most states are moving ahead to attract drone businesses.
Only the military will be allowed to use them.
He said that more than 50 companies that make drones do work in Virginia.
It urges states to make it necessary to get an order from a judge before they use a drone to watch anyone; ban drone videos or photos from being re-used in more than one police investigation; and ban weapons from drones used in the U.S.
But Marion reached a breaking point when a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager.

Yukie Hashimoto and her husband sent their daughter 200 miles away, to the pretty ski town of Matsumoto.
The mayor there had offered to take in and educate young people living near the Fukushima nuclear plant.
That may have had nothing to do with radiation, but it made Hashimoto decide to get her out.
Last Friday, she looked very much at home as she sat in the gymnasium at Aida Junior High School.
It took some time for the Hashimoto family to make its decision.

"This case has never been about race ... (or) about the right to bear arms," she said.
George Zimmerman was found not guilty of all charges in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager killed during a confrontation on a rainy night in Florida last year.
He said that he shot Martin in self-defense when the teenager attacked him.
Prosecutors argued that he had stalked Martin, 17, who was returning from a convenience store after buying Skittles and a soft drink.
"We are very, very, very saddened, but we accept the jury\'s verdict in this case," said Daryl Parks, one of the attorneys representing the Martin family.
Sybrina Fulton, Martin\'s mother, and Tracy Martin, his father, "are just heartbroken," he added.

Perhaps the intent is to use these rules of movement to design more nimble robots, said Jack Costello, a marine scientist at Providence College in Rhode Island.
It swims by moving the fin on its underside in a wave-like motion.
The scientists studied 22 very different species of finned swimmers using video recordings, lab studies and computer modeling.
"We found in every animal for which data are available, our prediction was correct," said Neelesh Patanka.
The findings could help scientists learn how to better build underwater robots that swim quickly and well, the researchers added.
The fraction of the length of each rippling wavelength to the height of each wavelength was about 20 to 1.
For each species they studied, including skates, rays, the black ghost knifefish, the cuttlefish and the Persian carpet flatworm \u2014 the fish all swam the same way.
There could be a thousand more finned-swimming species that have the same ratio, the authors of the study said.
"There\'s only a certain number of ways in which animals can move" well, MacIver pointed out.
If those alien animals were moving through liquid water on another planet, then the same rules apply.

The center is believed to be one of the first of its kind along the border, said founding member and local librarian Leesa Jacobson.
"They all want rides to Tucson, and I say, \'No, no I cannot do that.\'"
In 2005, tensions in Arivaca between aid groups and Border Patrol agents reached a peak.

Lugging groceries and supplies to the astronauts on the International Space Station may not be as cool as transporting the astronauts themselves into orbit.
They argued that private industry could not be trusted with such high-stakes work and that the business of spaceflight should be left to NASA.
On a recent trip to Silicon Valley, Eric Stallmer, the president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, said many other investors seemed to have a fear-of-missing-out vibe.
"A lot of people were saying this is wrong; NASA has to have its own rocket."
Last year, NASA awarded contracts to SpaceX and Boeing, worth some $6.8 billion, to take astronauts to the space station.
In the coming months, it is expected to award another contract for cargo resupply, which could also be worth billions.
Its CST-100 capsule, originally designed for astronauts, could easily be reconfigured to handle cargo, said John Mulholland, a Boeing vice president in its space programs.
The company is promising to unveil "an innovative, reliable solution" at an invitation-only cocktail reception at Washington\'s Union Station this week.
Lockheed makes the Orion space capsule, which NASA launched on a historic mission late last year, sending the spacecraft farther than any vehicle designed for human travel had gone in 40 years.
Still, NASA has invested more than $363 million in its Dream Chaser space plane, which looks like a miniature version of the space shuttle and can land on airport runways.
It is an entirely different approach than the other companies\' offerings, which is in part why it "can\'t be counted out," said Caceres, the space analyst.

Hot dogs are a rare sight in Afghanistan.
So it was particularly unusual when five vehicles painted to look like giant frankfurters \u2014 with bright yellow mustard zigzags \u2014 popped up on the streets of the capital city this year.
Naveed Noori, 25, introduced Afghanistan to food trucks after studying the trend online and in Toronto, where his wife and baby daughter live.

Custom-printed menus, napkins and other paper goods are also transported overland from Pakistan, as are the chicken hot dogs.
The rest of the food, including more than 3,000 chicken patties and 7,000 samosa pastries each week, is cooked at their rented office, where the trucks are parked overnight.
For now, Noori said, they sell about $450 in food every day, enough to turn a small monthly profit.
"We have to explain to them every day what we are doing," said Shuja, who was wearing a blue company polo shirt.
However, Noori said, attempts to get official permits were delayed by the recent presidential election crisis, which paralyzed government agencies for months.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/venus.jpg"  />PITTSBURGH \u2014 High-tech detective work by Carnegie Mellon students uncovered new images by artist Andy Warhol.
Just the possibility that something new by the King of Pop Art had been discovered was enough to excite Warhol fanatics around the world.
The 28 images were apparently created and stored by Warhol on nearly-unreadable computer disks almost 30 years ago.
The students found versions of some of his other most iconic artworks, such as a banana and actress Marilyn Monroe.
A man who worked with the now-closed Amiga World magazine called after reading a story about the discovery.
The magazine published a story in 1986 about Warhol and his use of the Amiga computer.

Jennifer Kavanaugh has been a teacher for 13 years.
If it is used, the local board of education must determine how it will be used and whether a parent will be notified or can opt for a different form of discipline.
District officials believe there are better ways to discipline a child, ranging from teacher-parent conferences to suspending or expelling the student, district spokeswoman Jana Shortt said.
For the 2009-2010 school year, about 184,500 students were physically punished, compared with about 223,000 in the 2005-2006 school year.
"I do not support corporal punishment, but my parents sent me to a faith-based school \u2026 I\'m opposed to government interfering" when it comes to such schools, she said.
Missouri does not keep track of which districts in the state use corporal punishment.

Almost 36 percent of adults and 12 percent of children in the United States are obese, or greatly overweight.
As such, it should encourage primary care physicians to talk about weight with their patients.

They argued whether the action would do more to help overweight patients get useful treatment, or would add more shame to the condition.
Doctors "tend to look at obesity as a behavior problem," said Dr. Rexford Ahima of the University of Pennsylvania.
That figure could rise by $550 billion over the next 20 years, Duke University found.
The government has approved just two new weight-loss medications since 1999.
The AMA does not want these to overshadow healthy diets and regular exercise.

"I think the glorified violence is really the Achilles heel for the NHL," said Charles "Bucky" Zimmerman, an attorney who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the players.
Zimmerman also worked on the legal battle that resulted in the NFL agreeing to pay a $765 million settlement to thousands of former players.
One argument that tries to separate the NFL battle from the NHL case is that by fighting, players willfully take on the health risks that could come from that.
"And the point is that the fighting arena would not exist and would be outlawed as it is in every other level of the game had the NHL not condoned it and sold tickets based upon it and promoted the sport in that way."
"If they would outlaw fighting, there wouldn\'t be people who would fight."
Zimmerman said he thinks more players will join the legal fight much in the same way the group of plaintiffs in the NFL case exponentially grew as it progressed.

A University of Kansas professor recently discovered what is believed to be the only audio recording of basketball inventor James Naismith.
It was part of a New York radio show called "We the People."
Naismith was given two weeks to create a new indoor activity for his gym class.
His mission was hurried along by a "real New England blizzard" that had students climbing the walls with little to do.
"We know ... there was the first game, then there was a second game with the full complement of rules," Zogry said.
Rob Rains, the author of "James Naismith: The Man Who Invented Basketball," co-written with Naismith\'s granddaughter Hellen Carpenter, said he did not know of any other audio recording of Naismith.
The school has obtained the 13 original rules and is building a structure to display them on campus.

The last lonely bird of a species that once numbered 3 billion died in 1914.
The last living member of a social species, she lived out her days alone in a cage in the Cincinnati Zoo.
Figure out which genes matter and then use genetic engineering to edit the DNA of a closely related species into some version of the extinct species.
So far, 32 passenger pigeon samples have had their genomes sequenced.
"All of our birds," Novak adds, "are all very, very similar to each other \u2014 like everybody being cousins, essentially \u2014 which is the effect of this recent rapid population expansion."
To figure out when the last boom occurred will require finding DNA from fossil samples thousands of years old.
There is "nothing in the data so far to shout at us to turn back now and not bring back the passenger pigeon," Novak says.
There were once more than 3 billion passenger pigeons in the world, but in 1914, there was just one.
If the de-extinction works, one remaining challenge would be to teach the new birds how to be passenger pigeons.
Doing that could be even more challenging than the genetic work itself.
The once-bustling oyster farm at the end of the dirt road looked as if it had suddenly been abandoned.
The park service won after spending millions of dollars in lawsuits that ended at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The weight of the water-logged wood is estimated at 375 tons, and lifting it out will likely require a powerful hoist.
Already a crew on the water was removing the remains of the oyster and clam operation.
Farmers have been cultivating oysters from the Estero since the 1960s.
The deal also allowed the former employees who live on the site to stay for at least three months while the government attempts to find housing for them.
The expense of restoring the Estero water will also be significant.

Five years later, Ta was on a plane to Richmond, Virginia, helped by a little-known program called the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) program.
Now, some see URM as a way to help some of the unaccompanied Central American children who have been surging across the U.S. border with Mexico.
In 2014, 44,000 children crossed the border alone, compared with fewer than 4,000 in 2011.
"The situations are pretty horrific."
The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service also supply caseworkers and care-giving help: both private agencies have experience in dealing with refugees.
In 2013, there were 1,850 children in the program, up from 1,409 in 2011.
The way to determine if someone is a refugee, and therefore eligible for URM, is to investigate the circumstances of their lives back home.
President Barack Obama opened the door for the children to be treated as refugees earlier this year when he said that some of the Central American children might apply under "narrow circumstances."
Obama also said that it is better for people to apply to be refugees in their home countries before making the trip to America.
"In the case of genuine refugees, these services are very appropriate," said Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit research organization that advocates tighter immigration policies.
In nearly 35 years, the program has helped some 13,000 children from Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America escape from war and natural disasters.
Some see URM as a way to help some of the unaccompanied Central American children who have been surging across the U.S. border with Mexico.
Fourteen states and the District of Columbia run their own URM programs.

"People feel sorry for them, and there\'s no question that times are tough in these countries," she said.

Some argue that labeling the Central American children refugees would be the surest way to get them the help they need.
Haynes says that it is scary to recognize that both the Central American children and children that have used URM in the past face the same kinds of difficulties.
However, widespread crime in a country "has never before been an excuse for designating people as refugees."
It took Asein Ta three days to walk through the mountains out of Myanmar, also known as Burma.

Some people see URM as a way to help unaccompanied Central American children who have come across the U.S. border with Mexico.
The United Nations has argued that the Central American children are refugees who should be able to move to other countries for safety.
Some have been victims of kidnapping or other crimes.
The U.S. government does not consider the children refugees.
That label would help the children use the URM program to settle in the United States.
It is unclear whether the program could help many of the Central American kids if they were considered to be refugees.
Some argue that labeling the children refugees would be the best way to get them the help they need.
In 2011, there were 1,409 children in the program, but by 2013, there were 1,850.

They have even gone so far as to suggest, using junk science pushed by climate change deniers, that vegetarians contribute more to greenhouse gas emissions than meat eaters.
The activists claim that if we were able to change how people eat, primarily in wealthier countries like the United States, we could take a significant bite out of climate change.
Yet it advises governments to push for the taxes through publicly funded public relations campaigns which make the matter appear clear-cut.
The idea that reducing meat consumption would make both humans and the Earth healthier is challenged by considering the environmental impact of the alternatives.
Of course, replacing meat with lettuce and comparing emissions on a calorie-for-calorie basis is absurd.
The report explains that "these perhaps counterintuitive results are primarily due to USDA recommendations for greater caloric intake of fruits, vegetables, dairy and fish/seafood."

Before the discovery of the wing flap, most experts agreed that the Boeing 777 crashed in a remote stretch of the Indian Ocean.
"What we have found in the western Indian Ocean does seem to indicate that the plane did come down more or less where we thought it did," Abbott said.
"For the first time, we might be a little bit closer to solving this baffling mystery."
"At least it is a piece of evidence," Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said.
It was on its way from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China.

After the attacks on Paris, what happened on Facebook resembled what happens when a friend dies: Profile pictures changed to those Eiffel Tower selfies, status updates were posted and a "peace for Paris" symbol went viral.

"I don\'t too much appreciate that," he said.
Robert McDaniel was puzzled when the Chicago police commander dropped by his West Side home last month.

An enormous stream of migrants and refugees \u2014 20,000 people last weekend alone \u2014 has come pouring into Germany only days before the Sept. 15 start of the school year.
Because most newly arrived pupils are not ready for regular classes, public schools and private groups offer preparatory "transition" courses ranging from a few months to two years.
"Politicians ignored it," said Monika Steinhauser, head of the local branch of the Refugee Council, which works closely with city authorities.
However, that swift proficiency can carry a pitfall of its own, familiar to immigrant families everywhere: Sometimes even very small children find themselves the "managers" of their family, helping to navigate tasks such as doctors\' visits or filling out paperwork.

Opening a new military front in the Middle East, President Barack Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes inside Syria for the first time Wednesday night.
Obama insisted that his plan to "degrade and ultimately destroy" ISIL would not involve returning U.S. combat troops to the Middle East.
Administration officials have said they are not aware of a true threat of a potential attack by the militants in the U.S. All the same, they say the group poses risks to Americans and interests across the Middle East.
Officials are also concerned that Westerners, including Americans, who have joined the militant group could return to their home countries to launch attacks.
In recent weeks, the militants have released videos showing the grisly murder of two American journalists in Syria.
Officials said Obama plans to proceed with both the broader airstrikes in Iraq and the strikes in Syria.
Instead, he is to act under authorization Congress passed after 9/11 to give President George W. Bush the ability to go after those responsible for the terror attacks.
Obama said his approach in Syria is modeled after those long-running U.S. counterterrorism efforts.
House Speaker John Boehner, Republican from Ohio, praised Obama for acknowledging the "grave and growing threat" that Islamic extremists pose.
Even before his remarks, congressional leaders were grappling with whether to support that request and how to get such a measure through a fiercely divided Congress.
The White House announced Wednesday that it was also providing $25 million in military assistance to the Iraqi government to combat ISIL.
The U.S. has been pressing allies in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere to help with efforts to weaken the terror group.

The Disney restrictions have been in place since 2003, thanks to an addition quietly slipped into a massive congressional spending bill weeks before the Iraq war.
The no-fly zones effectively ended a war between Disney and aerial advertisers who had buzzed over the parks for years before the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
An FAA spokeswoman said the agency also would like to take a closer look at no-fly zones over sporting events.
"Banner towers used to make money with their banner tows around Disneyland.
People can\'t take aerial photography shots," said Mark Skinner, owner of Anaheim Helicopters.
According to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, nearly 100 aerial advertising firms went out of business after Congress passed the no-fly zone laws over the Disney parks and sporting events.
They said attackers could plow planes into crowds of tourists, drop bombs on them, or spray them with chemical or biological agents.
"I would say, today, that the case for protecting Disney is even weaker than it was when we argued those cases," Crampton said.
Yet there is nothing temporary about the restriction over the Disney parks.

They had to tell Mars One why they wanted to be in the program.
Smith-Velazquez also had to speak with someone from Mars One.
Mars is very different from Earth.
The leaders for the design workshop came with lots of markers, drafting rulers that were too dull to double as weapons, and kiddie scissors.
"I feel an extra sense of purpose today," Paschall told his fellow classmates.
Soon after, VanBuren heard the founder of Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth speak about transformations at a West Oakland middle school.
They teamed up and she designed her first restorative justice room in a portable trailer at an Oakland high school.
The men were reluctant to share their feelings.
Deandre Hill, convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, and Christopher Gillis, facing murder and commercial robbery charges, sat side by side.
They imagined a cell with a computer that allowed for communication with family.
"The most important thing is to be accountable, but in order to work on yourself you have to be comfortable," said Gillis, who is planning a restorative justice circle to "make up for the harm" he had inflicted on his 16-year-old son through his absence and actions.
As his teammates stood beside him, Dante Hayes, facing charges of robbery and attempted rape, showed a design with a tree in the atrium representing growth and "the ability for us to grow."
On this final day, their paper models were taking shape.
As his teammates stood beside him, Dante Hayes, another participant, showed a design with a tree in the atrium representing "the ability for us to grow."
In a closing circle after the presentation, Pratt said his whole outlook had changed: Instead of "just beating each other upside the head, we can be like family."
Deanna VanBuren and Barb Toews are architects.
Some of their building ideas had individual cells with Internet connections and outdoor decks.
A growing number of people now believe that traditional criminal justice models are not helping to stop offenders from committing crimes again.
Toews, meanwhile, got started in restorative justice in the 1990s while doing voluntary service.
She told them the traditional system is like a boxing ring, with a winner and loser and outsiders determining the result.

Parents in Charlotte, North Carolina, celebrated this month when they learned that every public school in the city will have its own full-time nurse.
The agreement capped two years of work by a parents group started by Teri Saurer, the mother of daughters who just finished first and third grades.
"You want to know that if something happened to your child ... that there\'s going to be somebody with medical training who can attend to them," Saurer said.
Members of the group attended the county commissioner meetings wearing bright orange T-shirts with a message that read, "Healthy children learn better.
Advocates in Philadelphia are calling for enough money to restore nurses, teachers and other school staffers whose positions have been cut.
They also treat injuries and help students with physical and emotional issues.
U.S. school surveys from the Department of Education show 81,410 full-time and part-time nurses in all schools in 2011-12.
In Massachusetts, it found that for every dollar spent for the school health program, society got back $2.20.
Parents in Charlotte, North Carolina, are celebrating because every public school will have its own nurse this fall.
Several hundred parents had written to the Mecklenburg County government urging them to approve the money for school nurses, Saurer said.

About one in three schools had nurses who only worked there part of the time.
Toy-related injuries for American children are on the rise.
With about 3 billion model planes, hula hoops, building block sets and other toys sold in the U.S. every year, the researchers wrote, "the importance of toys in society" cannot be dismissed.
Most of the time, kids emerge unhurt from their play sessions.
Scooters helped make falls and crashes the most common types of toy-related injuries, accounting for 46 percent of falls and 22 percent of crashes.

Sebastien de la Cruz hit all the right notes when he sang the "Star Spangled Banner" last week at Game 3 of the National Basketball Association Finals in San Antonio.
Some people did not like the idea of Sebastien singing the anthem, especially not in the Mexican folk music outfit.
More than 55 percent of the population is Hispanic, and 90 percent of those people identify themselves as Mexican, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.
Hispanics represent about 17 percent of the country, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, making them the second largest demographic group in the country behind whites.
Lacey tweeted, "How you singing the anthem lookin like an illegal immigrant," as the _Augusta Chronicle_ newspaper in Georgia reported.
Sebastien de la Cruz sounded great when he sang the National Anthem last week at Game 3 of the National Basketball Association Finals in San Antonio.

Amr Zaidah, 26, knew exactly what to do and where to go.
With a GPS, he helped steer the boat that brought him and about 30 other migrants near the village of Molivos on Lesbos.
"I have researched our journey for more than two months," said Zaidah, a native of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
Zaidah and his group already know which border points they will cross, hotels they can stay in and stores where they can get cold-weather clothes as they head north.
Zaidah and his friends went straight to Molivos for the free bus rides.
Many others set off on the journey to Mytilene on foot in the summer heat and humidity.
They buy Greek numbers that allow data and roaming elsewhere in Europe so they can connect to Facebook and the apps they use to communicate with others.
The first thing they do is fish their phones out, joyously hug and take group selfies on the shore.
Then they call loved ones back in Turkey, Syria or Iraq, shouting, "We arrived in Greece!"
After nearly 12 hours, they found a departure area \u2014 only to discover it was run by a rival smuggler.
The smuggler said, "I can kill you now and no one will know, or I can call my coast guard friends who will alert the police to your group and come and arrest you."
All along the route, businesses have started up.
In Lesbos, Arabic signs have gone up on storefronts.
For a while, some Syrians and Iraqis sold fake versions of the documents that all the migrants need.
But they were put out of business when Greek authorities sped up the process for giving out the real papers, which are free.
Lesbos residents have found another way to make money.
Some wait on the coast with binoculars, and as soon as a boat lands, they swoop down in a pickup truck and look for things to sell.
"I used social media networks to look into where to go, who is the best smuggler to hire and what stuff we needed for the trip," Zaidah said.
On one Facebook group, for example, Syrians and others share the names and telephone numbers of good smugglers in Turkey.
The migrants are constantly on their phones.
During the sea journey, they keep their phones in plastic bags to keep them dry.

NASA has decided to crowdsource, or ask the public for ideas to detect and track asteroids that have the potential to wipe out life as we know it.
"Good ideas can come from anywhere," said Ben Burress, staff astronomer at Oakland\'s Chabot Space &amp; Science Center, which is not affiliated with NASA\'s Asteroid Grand Challenge.
With NASA out of the business of launching humans into space, "Earth\'s defense," as NASA calls it, is left in the hands of mere mortals.
"For the past three years, NASA has been learning and advancing the ability to leverage distributed algorithm and coding skills through the NASA Tournament Lab to solve tough problems," Jason Crusan said in a statement.
Asked how long the entire Asteroid Grand Challenge will last, Ramsey replied, "Until the problem\'s solved."
To find and track asteroids, NASA has decided to ask the public for ideas.
Currently, NASA estimates that only 1 percent of the asteroids hurtling around our solar system have been found.
The center uses the NASA Tournament Lab and its partner, the Harvard Business School, for programming contests.
"For the past three years, NASA has been learning and advancing the ability to (use) algorithm and coding skills through the NASA Tournament Lab to solve tough problems," Jason Crusan said in a statement.

To find and track asteroids, NASA has decided to ask the public for ideas.
In February 2013, a 65-foot-wide asteroid exploded over Russia, unleashing the force of 500,000 tons of TNT.
Afterward, NASA launched a series of contests for smart folks around the globe.
The hope is to defend Earth against asteroids that could be bearing down on us right this instant.
"For the past three years, NASA has been learning and advancing the ability to (use) algorithm and coding skills through the NASA Tournament Lab to solve tough problems," Jason Crusan said in a statement.
They hope to be able to find and track asteroids, identify their size and shape and whether they represent threats to Earth.
Then they will come up with ways to prevent them from hitting and wiping out plants, animals and humans.

Growing up in a tough Dallas neighborhood, Jordan Henderson saw just two options for his future \u2014 jail or the graveyard.
With little to look forward to, the 18-year-old began to get involved in drugs and other criminal activity.
"You can\'t just say all of these serious offenders are all bad and they\'re all going to be bad forever," said UTD criminologist Alex Piquero.
"We can turn some of these kids around if we give them these opportunities" and the same messages, he said.
"I thought to myself, this is the lifestyle that everybody before me shows, this is the lifestyle that everyone around me is doing and this is the lifestyle I have to choose."
For the first time in their lives, many feel a sense of approval and the joy that comes from living up to expectations, he said.
"When you give them hope and encouragement and literally, as silly as it sounds, a pat on the back, a \'good job,\' it changes their" attitude, he said.
Growing up in a dangerous Dallas neighborhood, Jordan Henderson prayed he would live to be 21.

Greg Page is CEO of Cargill Inc., a huge U.S. company that trades and produces foods including grains, livestock and cocoa.
That term has become code for big cocoa players like Cargill that are trying to stop child labor abuses.
But those efforts have fallen short.
Cargill says child labor abuses can be fixed by making cocoa farming more productive and profitable.
But given the size of the child labor problem, more investments are needed, Harkin said.
It said it does "actively develop, support and fund several programs to help eliminate the worst forms of child labor."
And Cargill should soon announce a three-year extension of that plan.
Cargill\'s program "is based on empowering communities so they can take control of their own future."
One of the worst practices is trafficking children into the Ivory Coast from neighboring countries Burkina Faso and Mali.
The Harkin-Engel Protocol failed in its goal of ending the worst forms of child labor by 2005.
The mixed results in the past decade call into question whether such goals can be met, Tulane found.
There could be no chocolate without cocoa.
There could be no chocolate without cocoa.
These reports have been around for more than a decade.
There have been many attempts to cure child labor issues.
But, the companies that process cocoa, such as Cargill and ADM, have been less active, he said.
But progress will be slow, Terheijden said.
These features are difficult to see with the naked eye, he said.
He also argued that the design of the tomb suggests it was built for a queen, rather than a king.
The ancient royal family is full of secrets, el-Damaty said.
El-Damaty said he will seek approval to use radar to inspect the tomb, by bouncing radio waves off of any objects.
He made the announcement while touring the burial sites of Tutankhamun, known as King Tut, and other pharaohs in the famed Valley of the Kings.
Reeves recently speculated that Tutankhamun may have been buried in an outer chamber of what was originally the tomb of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti.
The features are difficult to see with the naked eye, he said.
El-Damaty was visiting Luxor with British Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves.
Tutankhamun was an Egyptian king.
Mamdouh wants to look for the rooms.
Nicholas said the walls may hide two doorways.
Sea turtles eat many things in the wide open ocean.
They are considered to be "threatened" in most parts of the world.

They eat jellyfish and other floating animals in the ocean.
Schuyler also worries about micro plastics.
Like a flower shedding its petals, an aging star casts off its outer layers, surrounding itself with cloud-like shells of gas and dust.
Soon the researchers began to notice something strange: More than half of the bipolar nebulae seemed to be aligned, even though they were separated by vast distances of many light-years amid the crowded galactic bulge.
The nebulae\'s shared alignment points to "a powerful magnetic pull in the galactic bulge when they were formed," Rees said.
The findings could help explain how "bipolar nebulae are formed, and provide some insight, possibly, on the way the bulge was formed," he said.
Only the magnetized nails will turn and point if you bring the magnet near.

"To drive with a license should not be against the law," she said.
Many Saudis have become more open to the idea of women driving, she added.
Those who oppose the ban say it means families have to employ expensive private drivers.
Not being able to drive makes it difficult for women to work or carry out many other daily tasks, too.
They also point out that Saudi women living outside of cities frequently drive without being stopped by the police.
In a show of support, some newspapers published opinion pieces arguing that women should be allowed to drive.

Scientists in Europe say they unearthed strong evidence that Neanderthals carved their own specialized bone tools.
The find adds to the evidence that Neanderthals were more advanced than previously thought, contrary to their brutish, club lugging ape-men image.
The implements are the oldest specialized bone tools found in Europe, said archaeologist Marie Soressi of The Netherlands.
Before this, tools unearthed at Neanderthal sites were almost exclusively made of stone.
If so, Neanderthals might have figured out how to make the tools themselves, Soressi and her team wrote.
"I don\'t think that the image of the brutish or stupid Neanderthal is true anymore," said Paola Villa of the  University of Colorado Museum of Natural History.
Team member and archaeologist William Rendu noticed the unusual looking fragment of deer rib.
Further examination under a microscope revealed that the piece, less than a centimeter long, had a worn edge and a polished surface.
To confirm that the tip came from a lissoir, the researchers made their own lissoirs and scraped them against animal hides.
When they compared their tools to the piece they had found, using a microscope, the tools shared the same signs of wear: cracks radiating from the tip.
The group found three over the next seven years, and confirmed they too were from leather-working tools.
"We didn\'t expect to find these bones," said McPherron.
Tests dated one of the lissoirs to 51,000 years ago \u2014 thousands of years before modern humans arrived in Europe.
The findings add to earlier evidence of advanced behavior in Neanderthals.
Scientists in Europe have dug up special, prehistoric tools made from bones.
Neanderthals might have figured out how to make the tools themselves, Soressi and her team wrote.
The ancient piece was probably a tip that had broken off, she said.
McPherron and his coworkers began searching for lissoir pieces too.
Henry said most of the evidence suggested that Neanderthals copied bone tools from modern humans.
Scientists in Europe have dug up special, prehistoric tools made from bones.
Archaeologists said they dug up of four pieces of bone tools known as lissoirs at two Neanderthal sites in southwestern France.
They described the findings in a science magazine.
The pieces are the oldest specialized bone tools found in Europe, said archaeologist Marie Soressi of the Netherlands.
But the recently found lissoirs are about 41,000 to 51,000 years old.
They could have been in Europe long before modern humans got there.
Neanderthals might have figured out how to make the tools themselves, Soressi and her team wrote.
The Freer Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. hopes to save Asian artworks for future generations.
For example, some of the older paintings were mounted on acidic paper backings, which eventually fall apart.
Senior conservator Gu, who arrived in 1991, trains her apprentices the way she was trained, with traditional, hands-on, practical, and sometimes tedious, work.
"From 1966 to 1972, no work, all stop," she said.
"We worked eight hours a day, six days a week," she said of her training years.
For example, some of the older paintings in the museum were mounted on acidic paper backings, which eventually fall apart.

The Freer Gallery of Art is a museum in Washington D.C. that houses old paintings from Asia.
For example, some of the older paintings in the museum were mounted on acidic paper backings.
The department is the only U.S. program that teaches conservators how to care for delicate Chinese paintings.
In 1904, Charles Freer gave more than 7,000 pieces from his personal American and Asian art collection to the Smithsonian.

In the rings of ancient and gnarled trees, a team of scientists has found evidence of a period of constant warmth and wetness in Mongolia between 1211 and 1225.
The abundant grass would in turn increase the number of animals that could graze and live off it.
"He didn\'t have to come eat, and he didn\'t have to eat the way he did, but the table was set."
The story of the unusual wet period in Mongolian history was written in scores of ancient Siberian pine trees.
The trees were growing on a nearly soil-less lava field in central Mongolia that was dotted with horse skeletons.
Those samples confirmed the initial findings: The spread of the Mongolian empire happened along with what the trees recorded as a warmer and wetter climate than usual.
Mongolia is an area known for its cold and dry climate.
When they got them back to the lab, they discovered that some of those samples dated back more than 1,000 years.
Those samples matched the initial findings: The spread of the Mongol Empire happened along with what the trees recorded as a warmer and wetter climate than usual.

"I think of it as nature set the table, and Genghis Khan came to eat," said Amy Hessl.
Those samples agreed with the original findings: The spread of the Mongol Empire happened along with what the trees recorded as a warmer and wetter climate than usual.
Pederson and Hessl first discovered them during a trip in 2010.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., upset both athletes and Olympic officials on Wednesday when he suggested that the United States should consider not going to the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia.
He recently leaked details about the way the NSA has been secretly monitoring phone calls and computer messages in the U.S. and abroad.
Just the suggestion of a boycott was enough for the U.S. Olympic Committee to release a statement that said members "strongly oppose" the idea.
Back in 1980 Ron Neugent was a member of the U.S. Olympic swimming team.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and John McCain, R-Ariz., disagreed with it.
Indeed, the USSR remained in Afghanistan until 1989.
"Jimmy Carter and his administration were very, very naive ... [about the way] international sports works," he said Wednesday.
He had taken a year off from the University of Kansas to focus on his training.
"Punishing athletes because the government can\'t resolve its issues isn\'t right," he said in an email.
In its statement, the committee referred to the Olympic boycott that happened in 1980.
The boycott was meant as a protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
He was just another warlord in an age of warlords.
Leon Jung figured it would take something out of the ordinary to save his brown front lawn during the California drought.
You just have to be willing to haul it home in tanks, drums, barrels or jugs \u2014 a back-to-the-basics rescue effort in the state with the most highly engineered water delivery systems in America.
Officials said water shortages in the drought have helped many consumers get past the yuck factor of using recycled toilet water.
The sewer plants give the recycled water they distribute extra treatment with sand filters and disinfectant.
Before hauling away their first load, though, consumers must promise not to use it for drinking or swimming pools or put it in household water pipes.
"Some of our customers have become very creative in coming up with systems to get the water into hoses and drip systems," said Melody LaBella.

In the years since, Yu and others have sought to flesh out the stories of these long-anonymous Chinese migrants and win wider recognition for their role in the building of the American West.
Remarkably little is known of the 12,000 Chinese migrants who came to build the railways.
Many are listed in surviving records only under nicknames like "China Sam" or "China Jim."
He is aiming to create an hour-long documentary on the subject, as part of the Stanford effort.
While working on the American railroads, Chinese laborers faced severe discrimination.
"The way was paved by several generations that really suffered and worked very hard," he said.
"I hope projects like this help the newly arrived see this."
In early June, about 250 people came to Stanford University to talk about the migrants.
These days, Asians who move to the United States have a much easier time.

A cluster of thunderstorms marched across the Midwest late in the season.
Their correct predictions were combined with television and radio warnings, text-message alerts and storm sirens.
"I\'d say probably two dozen phones started going off in the service," he said.

Bennett stopped the service and made sure everyone got to a safe place until the threat passed.
He suffered a leg injury when the wind knocked his home off its base.
An outbreak like the one that developed Sunday usually happens about once every seven to 10 years.
The storms erupted because of unusually warm, wet air from Louisiana to Michigan that was then hit by an upper-level cold front.
Because it was high in wind shear, the storm system moved fast, like a speeding car.
That meant the system hit more places before it died out, affecting more people.

The holes are about a foot in diameter and seem to survive for less than a day before filling in naturally with sand.
But no one is entirely certain why the holes form along the surface of this landmark, which attracts thousands of visitors each year.
The National Park Service announced this week that Mount Baldy will remain closed indefinitely due to the discovery of two new holes and a number of depressions on the north side slope.
There, the trees and grass \u2014 and even an old staircase that once led to a viewing spot \u2014 are now buried, Argyilan said.
The rest of the national lakeshore will remain open, though officials request visitors stay on designated trails to prevent erosion and damage.
The geology professor had been conducting research at the base of Mount Baldy in mid-July when she heard the screams of parents some 400 feet away.
In August, a second hole was spotted nearby, this one about 10 inches wide and at least 5 feet deep.
Argilyan believes that holes are unlikely to start appearing at other sand dunes that have been kept in a more natural state.
"We don\'t know exactly what\'s going on out there; we can\'t let folks out onto the area until we know it\'s safe," said Ken Mehne, who works as a law enforcement expert for the park.

<img class="pull-right" src="//newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/20131008_Higgs_boson_Nobel.jpg" />STOCKHOLM \u2014 Francois Englert of Belgium and Peter Higgs of Britain won the Nobel Prize in physics on Tuesday.
The 80-year-old Englert said he could not have imagined getting a Nobel Prize when he stated the research 50 years ago.
Awarding just the men behind the theoretical discovery of the particle solved a tricky problem for the committee.
Academy member Ulf Danielsson noted that the prize document also honored the work done at CERN.
He said, "This is a giant discovery, it means the final building block in the so-called standard model for particle physics has been put in place."
They believed the tiny particle acts like molasses on snow \u2014 causing other basic building blocks of nature to stick together, slow down and form atoms.
They are slowed down like a ball rolling through molasses.
If this is the case, then it should be possible to detect a type of particle, dubbed the Higgs boson.
Michael Turner, president an organization of physicists, said the Higgs particle captured the imagination of the public.
"If you\'re a physicist, you can\'t get in a taxi anywhere in the world without having the driver ask you about the Higgs particle," said Turner.
On Monday, the Nobel Prize in medicine was given to three American scientists for discoveries about how important substances are moved around within cells.
They will be handed out on Dec. 10 \u2014 the anniversary of his death in 1896.
Each prize is worth $1.2 million.

It was also known as the Higgs boson.
The standard model is the basic picture of how physics works on Earth.
They had an explanation that centers on the idea that there is an invisible field throughout the universe.
But beyond that, he said, it represents the first in a class of particles that scientists think played a part in shaping the universe.

For over two decades now the theft has been a mystery to the FBI and the people of Boston.
Another work, "The Concert" by Johannes Vermeer, is the world\'s most valuable stolen painting.
"Today, we are pleased to announce that the FBI has made significant progress in the search for the stolen art," special agent Richard DesLauriers told reporters.
"We\'ve determined in the years after the theft that the art was transported to Connecticut and Philadelphia.
The $5 million reward is for any tips that might help bring the artworks home.
"You don\'t have to hand us the paintings to be eligible for the reward," said Anthony Amore.
"It\'s likely over time someone has seen the art hanging on a wall or stored in an attic.
"The key goal here is to recover those paintings and bring them back," Ortiz said.
The museum is named after Isabella Gardner, who spent 30 years collecting the art that is now inside.
Gardner opened her museum in 1903 with a grand party where doughnuts were served.

He is also busy lobbying against a bill that would repeal in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants, which has been in place in Texas since 2001.
Murdock has been arguing for decades that Texas and other states must do a better job of educating minorities, especially Hispanics, or employers will go overseas to find skilled workers.
Chief executive Bill Hammond described the billboard as a "conversation starter" that will highlight this issue heading into the legislative session.
Murdock says rising dropout rates and falling family incomes will put an increasing strain on the state if Hispanics are left behind.
"Keep in mind that many of the families of Texas Hispanics have been since here before there was a Texas and before it joined the U. S.," Murdock said.
Murdock has been arguing for decades that Texas and other states must do a better job of educating minorities, especially Hispanics.
It criticized low graduation rates at the University of Texas at San Antonio, where about 44 percent of students are Hispanic.
They need advice and role models for academic achievement, said Michael Soto, a professor at Trinity University in San Antonio.
There are a number of proven programs for students from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds," said Soto.

Her plan was to catch pieces of a mysterious marine ecosystem scientists are calling the plastisphere.
About 245 million tons of plastic is produced annually around the world.
Once trapped in these zones, plastic particles may persist for centuries.
The effects of visible plastic debris on the fish, birds, turtles and marine mammals that swallow it are well-documented: clogged intestines, suffocation, loss of vital nutrients, starvation.
Carpenter speculated that hazardous chemicals showing up in ocean animals may have leached out of bits of plastic.
They are collecting seawater and marine life to analyze the types, sizes and chemical compositions of the plastic fragments they contain.
"We\'re changing the basic rhythms of life in the world\'s oceans, and we need to understand the consequences of that," said Miriam Goldstein, a marine biologist who has studied plastic debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch between Hawaii and California.
In October, Goldstein and oceanographer Deb Goodwin reported that one-third of the gooseneck barnacles they collected from the garbage patch had plastic particles in their guts.
The typical fragment measured 1.4 millimeters across, not much bigger than a piece of glitter.
Fish that ingest plastic debris tend to accumulate hazardous substances in their bodies and suffer from liver toxicity.
Not only is the plastic itself dangerous, so too are the toxic chemicals the plastic has absorbed.

She was hoping to catch pieces of something scientists are calling the plastisphere.
It starts with bits of broken-down plastic no bigger than grains of salt.
When that debris washes into the ocean, it breaks down into bits that are then colonized by microscopic organisms.
But the effects of the tiny pieces that make up the plastisphere are only beginning to be understood.

"This state has lost more of its wetlands than all other states, and beavers can rebuild those wetlands," said Rick Lanman.
California allows beavers to be hunted and killed or moved if they cause trouble.
Three years of drought have dried up California streams, rivers and wetlands.
"This state has lost more of its wetlands than all other states," said Rick Lanman of the Institute for Historical Ecology in California.

Beaver dams help nature in ways that humans cannot easily copy.
Scientists are thinking about using beavers to bring back wetlands, he said.
The water in the beaver pools is warmer at the top and cooler at the bottom.
"Fish are able to find the temperature that is ideal for them," Pollock said.
This is not the first time people are using beavers to help nature.
No one knows how many beavers live in California now.
Beavers can improve damaged streams more cheaply than humans.
The streams could dry up from the heat.

If the dams work, beavers can stay where they are.
Elite sailors have warned that high-speed collisions with floating debris could damage or even sink sailboats during the Olympics.
"Those who live around the bay can already notice a difference over the past two years," Serva said.
Moscatelli said the major rivers flowing into the bay should be fitted with heavyweight "eco-barriers" to filter out the garbage at the source.

The Webb Schools, a private high school in Claremont, attracts college recruiters from around the country and even the world.
Among schools in well-off communities, La Canada High School had 127 visits from recruiters between August and November.
Pasadena High School had 20 visits over the fall semester; Compton High, five; Hoover High in Glendale, 15; Santa Ana High, five; Belmont High near downtown Los Angeles, about 25.
"I think it would make a huge difference," said Vasquez, who wants to study engineering.
He believes it\'s because they don\'t think "there could be a student in this school who has the potential to win the next Nobel Prize, come up with a new technology or change the world."
In research that tracked young Latino and black men with good grades in New York City, Harper found that many colleges avoided their high schools.
They search for them through large college fairs, citywide recruiting sessions, online outreach and videotaped presentations.
Given limits on recruiters\' time, the pattern of high school visits can be "self-perpetuating," said Robert Springall, admissions dean at Pennsylvania\'s Bucknell University.
His representative visited about two dozen high schools in the Los Angeles region this fall, but no schools in a poorer L.A. district.
He said some colleges probably stay away from public schools like his because they don\'t think there could be a student in the school who could "win the next Nobel Prize, come up with a new technology or change the world."

Part of the problem, said Andrew Thomas, the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Transportation Security, is that airline systems are not as advanced as many people might think.
A case in point, he said, is that airports and airplanes around the world use old radar tracking technology, instead of modern GPS satellite navigation systems.
"The next-generation technology would cost $70 to $80 billion in the U.S." Experts say the plane\'s disappearance will likely pressure airlines and governments to improve the way they monitor planes.

As long as Russia and Iran back Assad, he will stick around \u2014 as will the war against him.
Without U.S. participation, the prospects for a successful conventional war against ISIS are slim.
Adding force bit by bit \u2014 50 special ops troops here, a few more airstrikes there \u2014 cannot substantially alter the current unpleasant facts on the ground.
The delay of meaningful ground action risks allowing the twin dangers of the extremist group to spread even farther.
The problem is that a military effort to destroy Islamic State is not likely to work.
President Barack Obama understands that if he were to proclaim a goal of definitively eliminating ISIS in the short term, he would fail.
The exclusion of the Sunnis spawned Sunni-led armed groups like Islamic State.
Rabbi Michael Lerner, a philosopher and expert on the Middle East, wrote after the Paris attacks, "Until the powerful countries of the world are seen as mainly driven by a desire to care for the well-being of everyone else on the planet and the well-being of the planet itself, and care not only out of self-interest but also out of a new consciousness in which we all come to truly understand our mutual interdependence and oneness, what we saw in Paris this past week is destined to be an increasing reality in the coming decades."
The Paris attacks provide a new and compelling reason for the West to take action to undercut the negative sentiment about the West.
The lack of a solution for that conflict, which has been festering for so long, bears a direct relation to the massacre in Paris.
The Arab countries were unable to deal with Israel to secure a country for the Palestinians.
By positive policy changes, we must change the views that have generated terror attacks.

The support of the Western powers, and particularly the United States, of Israel was a battle cry for Osama bin Laden.
With tens of thousands of foreign fighters and sophisticated social networking, the Islamic State already had a global reach.
Its conquering of land rich in oil made it the wealthiest extremist group in history.
It is combining the most effective terror practices developed by extremist groups over the last three decades.
They are unfolding across Europe as America watches.
Clearly, our plan for dealing with the Islamic State has been insufficient.
While ISIS has suffered defeats, like when the ethnic Kurds\xa0recently\xa0took back the city of Sinjar, it has bounced back every time.
Without U.S. participation, the prospects for winning a typical war against ISIS are slim.
He boasted of ending the war in Iraq and withdrawing U.S. troops.
It is just like when U.S. President George W. Bush spoke of a war against al-Qaida after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States.
He wrote, after the Paris attacks, "Until the powerful countries of the world are seen as mainly driven by a desire to care for the well-being of everyone else on the planet and the well-being of the planet itself, and care not only out of self-interest but also out of a new consciousness in which we all come to truly understand our mutual interdependence and oneness, what we saw in Paris this past week is destined to be an increasing reality in the coming decades."
We must do so in a way that undermines the anti-Western attitudes that led to the violence we saw on the streets of Paris.
The Paris attacks provide a new reason for the West to take action to undercut the hatred of the West.

Archaeologists have been studying the site since 1994 when the original James Fort was rediscovered.
He died at the age of 34 during a six-month period known as the "starving time" when many died due to disease, starvation and battles with Indians.
So the discovery raises the question of whether Archer was part of a secret Catholic cell \u2014 or even a Catholic spy on behalf of the Spanish, Horn said.
The silk material was too delicate to remove from the dirt, so archaeologists removed an entire block of dirt.
Archaeologists will continue searching the church site and expect to eventually find the burial of Sir Thomas West, the early governor of Virginia.
Still, they will work to complete more testing and potentially DNA analysis.
The archaeology team said the discovery is a riddle they must figure out over time.
"What we have discovered here in the earliest English church in America are four of the first leaders of America," said historian James Horn.
Archer helped lead some of the earliest expeditions to Jamestown.
"It was a real kind of ah-ha moment for a lot of us," said William Kelso.
"It was oh, religion was a big deal here, and that\'s often overlooked."
The three other men likely died from illnesses.
"The things that we look at and can read from the bones are simply details that you\'re not going to find in the history books," said Douglas Owsley.

Chris Christie said Monday he "reluctantly" signed a bill that prohibits attempts to convert children from gay to straight.
He cited the American Psychological Association, which has found the treatment can lead to depression, substance abuse and suicidal thoughts.
His past comments set him apart from the more conservative wing of the Republican Party, which holds that homosexuality is a sin.
During committee hearings, witnesses described brutal childhood experiences in which they were forced to undergo conversion therapy efforts.
"Studies and personal testimony have shown this practice creates irreparable harm on young people struggling to come to terms with their sexuality," Assemblyman Tim Eustace said in a statement Monday.
Christie has mostly earned only criticism from gay advocates.
The governor, who is Catholic, responded that his religion says it is.
The legislation passed the Assembly by a 56-14 in June.
Others argue that same-sex marriage is a civil right, and such rights should not be decided by popular vote.
They say such rights should not be decided at the voting booth.
"I believe that exposing children to these health risks without clear evidence of benefits that outweigh these serious risks is not appropriate," Christie wrote.
The ban comes as Christie runs for re-election in New Jersey this year and prepares for a possible presidential campaign in 2016.
He stopped a bill last year that would have allowed same-sex marriage in New Jersey.

About 1,500 years ago, a disease called the Justinian Plague killed up to 50 million people from Asia to Africa to Europe.
"Fortunately, we now have antibiotics that could effectively be used to treat plague," said study co-author Dave Wagner of Northern Arizona University.
For now, the authors can only guess that either human populations evolved to become less affected by its deadly ways, or that climatic changes taking place at the time created a less friendly environment for the Justinian Plague germ.
The Justinian Plague, the Black Plague, and even the plague that surged in the late 1800s and early 1900s followed periods of exceptional rainfall and ended periods of climatic stability.
New and equally deadly strains could appear just as mysteriously, they wrote.
The Justinian Plague strains appeared to have been even deadlier than the Y. pestis strains that re-emerged during the Black Plague outbreak.
Both the Justinian Plague, the Black Plague, and a plague that occurred in the late 1800s and early 1900s followed periods of exceptional rainfall and ended periods of normal climate patterns.
About 1,500 years ago, a disease called the Justinian Plague killed up to 50 million people.
New and equally deadly strains could appear just as mysteriously, they wrote.
Next, they reconstructed the genetic material of the strain that killed both victims.
Finally, they compared it with more than 100 strains of bacteria from the same family.
The strain that caused the Justinian Plague is a member of the bacterial family Yersinia pestis.
The Justinian Plague strains appeared to have been even deadlier than the Y. pestis strains that re-emerged during the Black Plague outbreak.
What became of the strain after it killed so many?

At first it seemed to be just another mass shooting in America.
That is a far more complex debate with fewer clear-cut answers.
The president has said he worries about the difficulties of preventing homegrown attacks on U.S. soil \u2014 and the limits of security measures to prevent them.
He asked for patience, assured Americans they were safe and, notably, toned down his typically forceful call for congressional action on gun control.
After a briefing from his national security team, Obama asked the American people and lawmakers to find a way to make it "a little harder" for people to get guns.

The observatory at One World Trade Center (1 WTC) opens May 29 in lower Manhattan.
These shifts occur as changes in temperature, wind and other conditions cause skyscrapers to sway slightly throughout the course of a day.
At 1 WTC, elevator car jostling is minimized through what is known as an "active roller guide" system.
"You\'re creating a situation where the hoistway doors above the car want to blow out into the hallway and the hoistway doors below the car want to suck into the hoistway."
Air pressure changes that affect people inside the car are more difficult to deal with, however.
Elevators generally do not descend faster than 22 miles an hour, however, because anything faster can lead to ear-popping.
Traffic management is an essential part of elevator use in high-rise buildings.
The elevators at 1 WTC rely on a kiosk setup in the lobby that determines which elevator a particular visitor will ride.
The observation deck at One World Trade Center (1 WTC) opens May 29 in lower Manhattan.
Like a bullet train, it also requires incredibly smooth rails and rail joints to move swiftly.

They also feature several advanced technologies designed to improve ride quality and safety.
Such features show just how far they have come since the first passenger elevator was introduced in 1857.
"You can\'t ever have a perfect plane for an elevator to travel in very tall buildings," elevator expert John Koshak says.
Such active roller-guide systems are "like hugely intelligent shock absorbers," Koshak says.
As a typical 10,000-pound elevator car rushes up its hoistway, a massive quantity of air is displaced.
The result is "an area of high pressure above the car and low pressure below it," Koshak explains.
"The hoistway doors above the car want to blow out into the hallway and the hoistway doors below the car want to suck into the hoistway."

When word spread \u2014 mistakenly \u2014 that Los Angeles-based Baby2Baby was handing out diapers directly to parents, desperate parents came to its office.
A single mother earning $15,080 a year in a [minimum-wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) job would need to devote more than 6 percent of her pay to diapers, according to the study.
The report in Pediatrics is the first academic study to quantify diaper need, said co-authors Megan Smith of the Yale School of Medicine and Joanne Goldblum of the National Diaper Bank Network.
Women 45 or older, who the team assumed were mostly caring for grandchildren, also had greater need.
Women who said they had a lot of difficulty managing stress, sadness or trauma were nearly twice as likely as others to report diaper need, said Smith.
Nearly 8 percent of the women in the study reported that they "stretched" diapers when supplies ran short.
In 2011, Rep. Rosa DeLauro introduced a bill in Congress that would have made it easier for child-care providers to use federal funds to supply diapers to needy families.
For now, much of the need will be met by nonprofits like the National Diaper Bank Network.
Diapers have motivated parents to keep showing up for class, said Aubrey, who added that providing access to diapers "instills confidence" in struggling parents.
Most child-care providers require that parents supply diapers.
Beth Capper gave birth to her son Ezekiel 11 months ago.
The group received 3,000 voicemail messages in one day.
"No one wants to have their child in a (dirty) diaper all day long," she said.
According to a report published in the journal Pediatrics, this is a problem that affects a large number of low-income Americans.
Nearly 30 percent of mothers questioned for the study live in New Haven, Conn., and do not have enough diapers for their children.
And cloth diapers are often not an option because they require many trips to the laundromat.
Women who said they had a lot of difficulty managing stress or sadness were nearly twice as likely as others to report diaper need, said Smith.
In Los Angeles, the need for diapers is constant.
When word spread that a Los Angeles-based organization was handing out diapers, desperate parents came to its office.
A long line formed and the organization received 3,000 voicemail messages that day.
Parents in need can get money from the government to help pay their health-care costs.
They also asked the women about being able to get to basic needs like food, housing and diapers.
In order for their children to have diapers, the women had to ask for help from organizations, friends or family.
But wearing the same diaper for too long can lead to health problems.
Those problems include skin rashes and infections that require medicine.

But some of us have been celebrating "Madeline," and the other special books of our childhoods, all along.
Then it was on to my favorite chapter books \u2014 "Chancy and the Grand Rascal," "Knight\'s Castle" and, of course, "The Phantom Tollbooth."
It is high praise.
A recent BuzzFeed post of tattoos based on children\'s books included such classics beloved as "The Velveteen Rabbit," "The Little Prince," "Goodnight Moon," "Corduroy," "Winnie the Pooh," "The Phantom Tollbooth" \u2014 and "Madeline."
All I have to do is read the last page of "Madeline" to hear my mother\'s voice whisper those last lines: _And she turned out the light \u2014 and closed the door \u2014 and that\'s all there is \u2014 there isn\'t any more._ Childhood books feel utterly real, even if they are filled with talking animals.
A friend of mine remembers watching her husband reading "Little House on the Prairie" to their 7-year-old son.
A friend of mine tried three different times to introduce her sons to "Winnie the Pooh," which she adored as a girl.
I knew these books so so well they seemed tattooed into my memory.
My older daughter had a couple of them tattooed onto her skin.
They included "The Velveteen Rabbit," "The Little Prince," "Goodnight Moon," "Corduroy," "Winnie the Pooh," "The Phantom Tollbooth" \u2014 and "Madeline."

"The drama of what happened, how it happened \u2014 it\'s so moving to me and so powerful, and for me to look at some of the drawings, it almost makes me cry," he said.
He said that a comic book in the 1950s called "Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story" had inspired him when he was 17, growing up 50 miles from Montgomery.

He remembered the beatings, the dogs and fire hoses turned on children by police.
"The drama of what happened, how it happened \u2014 it\'s so moving to me and so powerful," he said.
Lewis\' first book was the best-selling "March: Book One," which begins when he was a boy on his parents\' farm in Alabama.
To show this was wrong, they sat at the counters for white people and refused to move, in an act called sit-ins.
Lewis was one of six organizers of the march, and is the only one still living.
Last year, a grand jury decided not to indict, or charge, the white police officer who shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
It sounded ridiculous, Aydin said, "But it was still a good idea."

After finding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on every possible count for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing two years ago, a jury was told to answer another question.
"The choice between these very serious alternatives is yours, and yours alone, to make," O\'Toole said.
If even one juror chose life imprisonment over death, the sentence would automatically be life in prison.
"He killed indiscriminately to make a political statement, and he placed no value on the lives and didn\'t care for a second what impact his actions and his killings would have on so many other innocent family members and friends," said U.S. Attorney Steven Mellin, during the government\'s closing arguments.
Judy Clarke, his defense lawyer, used her closing argument to paint a picture of the older brother as Tsarnaev\'s "sole source of family, of support, of strength."
Last month, a jury found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.
The jurors were told to take into account two sets of factors when considering the sentence.
The death of one bombing victim in particular \u2014 8-year-old Martin Richard \u2014 was mentioned repeatedly as an aggravating factor.
"He placed no value on the lives and didn\'t care for a second what impact his actions and his killings would have on so many other innocent family members and friends,"  Mellin told the jurors.
Last week, it was told to answer another question: What should happen to him?
Only if they all agreed should they sentence him to death, the judge said.
In 2013, two brothers exploded bombs at the Boston Marathon.

"His actions have earned him a sentence of death."
Judy Clarke, Tsarnaev\'s defense lawyer, painted a picture of the older brother as Tsarnaev\'s "sole source of family, of support, of strength."
"The law values life, and you have no obligation to vote for death," she said to the jurors.
The federal death penalty law prevents a death sentence for anyone younger than 18 when they committed the crime.
The jurors were told to consider only the evidence presented in the trial.
They are not allowed to use information they may have read in the media or other information that was not brought up in the trial.
Tsarnaev is now the 62nd person on federal death row, the group of inmates waiting for execution.
Judy Clarke, Tsarnaev\'s lawyer, described the older brother as Tsarnaev\'s "sole source of family, of support, of strength."
In 2013, two brothers exploded bombs at the Boston Marathon.
On Friday, they sentenced Tsarnaev to death.

Appeals would keep Tsarnaev in the news and his case in their lives.
Tsarnaev "didn\'t care for a second what impact his actions and his killings would have on so many other innocent family members and friends," Mellin told the jury.
Judy Clarke, Tsarnaev\'s lawyer, described the older brother as Tsarnaev\'s "sole source of family, of support, of strength."
The jury spent 14 hours discussing the case before each one agreed on the sentence of death.
In 2013, two brothers exploded bombs at the Boston Marathon.
On April 15, 2013, Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, exploded two bombs at the race.
The law prevents a death sentence for anyone younger than 18 at the time of the crime.
If even one jury member said no to the death penalty, Tsarnaev would have to spend the rest of his life in prison.
He said that Tsarnaev did not care about the lives of his victims.

Business students at one college soon will have a more fun way to earn credits: by playing computer games.
Last week it announced that beginning in July it will offer game-based courses \u2014 with no instructors \u2014 as part of its two-year associate degree in business management.
David Weerts, a professor of higher education at the University of Minnesota, said that gaming technology can be useful for teaching some skills.
The risk, he said, is jumping into such a program without proof "that people are gaining something from this."
Nancy Black, an anthropology professor at Metro State University, was even more doubtful.
She also questioned how a computer game could test a student\'s judgment skills, especially "with no faculty whatsoever."

With a drone, Zach Fiene can receive detailed pictures of a corn field.
He can see exactly what parts of the field are struggling with plant disease, insects or a lack of water.
In minutes, he can gather as much information as someone walking for several hours.
"You can basically point the camera to where you want it to go," said Fiene, co-owner of DMZ Aerial.
And three weeks later the corn is dead because disease has spread," he said.
"Every time there\'s a report of a drone almost hitting a plane, that\'s not good for us," Fiene said.
I have told farmers to look up their address on Google Earth, and they would be amazed at the pictures out there," said Casey Langan.

In Manchester, England, a tree moth changed from mostly speckled ivory color to black in just a few years.
Near to the shore, water moves around a lot and the CO2 levels can vary at different times of day.
But in Southern California, the animals have experienced much less CO2.
They also found that some animals started to adapt successfully to higher levels of carbon dioxide.
Scientist Gretchen Hofmann has a tank full of wriggly sea urchins.
Like the moths, Hofmann thought that some urchins could handle the changes better than others.
It all depends on the levels of CO2 in the water that the animals are used to.
Near to the shore, for example, the water moves around a lot and the carbon dioxide levels change at different times of the day.
So Hofmann mated "wimpy" Southern California urchins with "tougher" males from the north.
Like the moths, Hofmann thought that some urchins could handle changes better than others.
So scientists are studying the urchins to learn how life under the sea will deal with big changes in the ocean.

Body size is very important for sea urchins.
In Manchester two hundred years ago, the dirt from factories darkened the light trees.
But ivory moths were easy to see on the dark trees.
So the most common moth color changed from ivory to black.
They also found that some urchins were getting used to higher levels of carbon dioxide.

The tallest bird in North America is the whooping crane, but it has one of the smallest populations, with only about 600 left alive.
Their deaths brought the number of intentional killings of the [endangered birds](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) to at least 19 since 2001.
That is more than the 13 cranes released into the wild each year on average by conservationists, according to Operation Migration.

As a practical matter, no one can say how much a ride on the bullet train would actually cost if and when the system becomes fully operational.
At that point, ticket prices will be set in consultation with a private company hired by the California High-Speed Rail Authority to operate the system, said Jeff Morales, CEO of the state rail agency.
A premium same-day nonstop trip would cost more than $86.
The French bullet train from Paris to Lyon is often cited as a line that is profitable.
The authority expects to generate additional revenue from things like advertising and concession fees at stations.
"The train will lose money and require" money from the state, said Joseph Vranich, former president of the national High-Speed Rail Association.

That beats their poultry processing duties, though, which are messy and bloody and not for the faint of heart.
The days of being able to buy some cheap land in the country are gone.
They have created programs to provide the next generation of farmers with the skills and land needed to be competitive.
"If we don\'t help the young generation of farmers get on the land, retiring farmers will quickly run out of people to sell the land to, individuals who will continue to grow food on it," Rippon-Butler said.
But they are the only age group under 55 whose numbers are increasing.
Most of them are first-generation, new to the business and trying to earn a living on independent farms.
Seventy percent of farmers younger than 30 rent farmland, compared with 37 percent of farmers over 30.

Designer Joseph Altuzarra turned to his Basque background for design ideas, and the results were beautiful.
It ultimately added up to a group of sharp jackets, breezy dresses and intriguing proportions that attract the eye.

Neither US Airways nor American Airlines, which are in the middle of merging, has hired pilots in more than a decade.
US Airways and American are expecting more than 2,100 pilots to retire within the next five years because retirement is required of pilots at age 65.
Currently, first officers only need to have a commercial pilot certificate, which requires just 250 hours of flight time.
Dennis Prokopowicz, an assistant system chief pilot with Jet Blue Airways, said it will be difficult for civilian pilots to achieve that many hours.
The Air Force said part of its problem is training new pilots.
Another problem has emerged with the proliferation of drones, and the resulting need for drone pilots.
Help wanted: At least 130 veteran military aviators.

The divers called her Naia, for "water nymph," because they discovered her teenage remains in a dark, underwater cave.
Researchers believe she was searching for water when she entered a dark, underground cave and then plummeted 100 feet into the massive chamber now called Hoyo Negro, or black hole.
Together, these discoveries have radically altered the long and heated debate over how humans came to inhabit the New World.
Faced with that difference, some archaeologists have argued that the Americas were originally populated by people from Europe as well as Asia.
Penned in by vast ice sheets, these people evolved in isolation for thousands of years in a land between Siberia and Alaska that scientists call Beringia.
"For years archaeologists have been debating this transatlantic thing, and really it\'s been an enormous distraction," said Hoffecker.
"These early skeletons are so rare we have to really get as much information as we can from them."
Initially, researchers hoped to leave the bones in place, which is normal for the preservation of underwater cultural remains.

On Tuesday, a federal agency opened a hearing to decide whether college athletes should be allowed to form a union.
And during August training, players often start practice at 8 a.m. and finish at 10 p.m. "It\'s a job, there is no way around it \u2014 it\'s a job," said Colter, a 21-year-old senior.
He said chemistry was always offered at times that conflicted with football practice.
Devoting more time to classwork at the expense of his football, he added, could result in the loss of a scholarship.
The university has repeatedly pointed out that Northwestern has one of the highest graduation rates for football teams in the country \u2014 around 97 percent of players receive degrees.
For now, the push to form unions for athletes is just at private schools, like Northwestern.

The instructor was killed Aug. 25 while teaching a 9-year-old girl to fire an Uzi submachine gun at the Last Stop range.
The Uzi the 9-year-old was shooting was on full automatic fire at the time of the accident.
There were no children present Thursday morning at the outdoor, desertlike range, where people fire toward a large ridge of dirt.
Arizona is one of 21 states that allows children under 18 to fire guns, as long as there is adult supervision, said Lindsey Zwicker.
She is a lawyer with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
The law was passed after an 8-year-old Connecticut boy died at a gun show in 2008 after he lost control of the Uzi he was firing.
Children have to be 10 or older and be supervised by a parent to shoot at the indoor range at all, Yeandle said.
He said the instructor makes sure to stay behind the shooter for safety and to keep control of the gun.
Last week, a 9-year-old girl accidentally shot a firearms teacher at a shooting range.
A gun is a tool, and like any tool \u2014 be it a hammer or a kitchen knife \u2014 it requires proper instruction, he said.
"It was clear that she was a beginner, and you don\'t start a beginner in that type of firearm," Jensen said.
The range where Jensen works does not allow full automatic fire.

The 18th-century British navigator Captain James Cook is celebrated as the first European to explore the South Pacific.
Few such vessels have lasted long enough to be found, because wood usually decays quickly.
"It was one of those situations where it sort of took your breath away," said study author Dilys Amanda Johns.
The New Zealand canoe also shares some design elements with a canoe found about 30 years ago in the Society Islands.
Scientists have tried to understand what sort of boats would have allowed seafaring Polynesians to brave the waters and winds.
For example, based on their model, the winds favored sailing from East Polynesia to New Zealand from 1140 to 1260.
"We think they were able to sail down here with or without help."
The 18th-century British navigator Captain James Cook is famous as the first European to explore the South Pacific.

According to a new study, Oreos may be as addictive as cocaine \u2014 for rats, anyway.
"It may explain why some people can\'t resist these foods" even though "they know they are bad for them."
Honohan said she also wanted to use something common in grocery stores.
In one experiment, rats were given Oreo cookies in one chamber and rice cakes in the other.
The rats spent far more time in the chamber where the Oreos had been.
The rats were given the choice of which chamber to spend time in.
"Maybe we can approach obesity the same way we address people addicted to drugs," she said.

"Just think: The speech, the exact words of it, are still looked at, thought about and" taken apart, said Michele Hamill of Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. One of five copies of Lincoln\'s handwritten speech is on display at Cornell in remembrance of its delivery on Nov. 19, 1863.
He was asked to by George Bancroft, a historian who wanted to make copies of the document to raise money for wounded soldiers.
Hamill said Lincoln used high-quality paper and special ink.
Bancroft was left with what at the time seemed to be a "piece of useless paper," Hamill said, but he held onto it and willed it to his grandson, a chemistry professor at Cornell.
And that he did it in perfect penmanship.

But the tiny crystal carries tremendous significance: It is evidence that by that point in its history, Earth had gone from a superheated ball of molten rock to a solid surface eventually capable of supporting life.
"One of the main goals of the space program is to understand if there\'s life elsewhere in the universe," said John Valley, a University of Wisconsin professor who led the study.
Jim Mattinson, a professor of earth science at University of California, Santa Barbara, said zircons have been found previously that were about the same age as the one in the current paper.
Scientists have theorized that one of the critical early events occurred when an asteroid roughly the size of Mars struck a glancing blow to the Earth, vaporizing the mantle and crust.

Scientists have thought that one of the critical early events occurred when an asteroid roughly the size of Mars hit the Earth.
The enormous energy from the crash reshaped the surfaces of the Earth and moon into oceans of rock that had turned to liquid by the heat of the crash.
The core is surrounded by the mantle \u2014 the thick, middle layer of the earth.
Both the Earth and moon later cooled.
Minerals were also formed as far back as zircon.
Yet, what makes zircon so valuable to scientists is its ability to last for so long.

It began as an irresistible story: A tiny, long-forgotten painting by a French master found in a flea market in West Virginia.
Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir was at lunch in Paris by the Seine River in 1879 with his girlfriend when he grabbed a napkin and used it to paint her a keepsake.
They were even more shocked when they discovered that "On the Shore of the Seine" had been stolen off their walls in 1951.
The painting was not listed on the Art Loss Register, an international database for missing and stolen works.
But the company has said it will give up its claim and transfer the work to the museum, at no cost.
She has indicated to the court that she intends to file a claim, even as questions swirl around her.
Now it is up to a judge to decide who owns the painting.
The Baltimore Museum of Art is expected to make a case for ownership.
The owner of the auction house spoke to Fuqua about the painting several months ago and thinks that she will ask for the painting.
It had the makings of a great tale: A long-forgotten painting by a famous French artist was found in a West Virginia flea market.

Then suddenly, Wainstein called off the auction.
Museum officials were surprised to learn it had once hung in their galleries.

Many of those who died were health workers, community nurses and faith healers, who treated people without protection, especially in the early stages of the epidemic.
More than 860 health workers came down with Ebola in West Africa and more than 500 died.
The WHO said Liberia\'s victory against Ebola was "a monumental achievement" in the most complex outbreak of the disease ever seen.
A country can be declared free of Ebola only after 42 days have passed.
As the disease peaked in Liberia in August and September, the number of cases increased rapidly, by 300 to 400 a week.
Patients often thought their symptoms were typhoid or malaria.
Treatment facilities like hospitals were swamped with cases, and patients often died at the gates of medical centers.
In many cases, there was no room inside the overcrowded centers to treat them safely.
In some cases community members left bodies in the streets.
There were not enough beds and the lack of space in treatment centers led to thousands of deaths.
At one point, almost no beds for Ebola patients were available in any treatment facility in the country, the WHO said.
"It is a tribute to the government and people of Liberia that determination to defeat Ebola never wavered, courage never faltered," it said.
The statement gave credit to local volunteers, who worked in treatment centers, on burial teams or as ambulance drivers.
"We must not let down our guard until the entire region reaches and stays at zero Ebola cases," it said.

For decades, scientists have been searching for something they believe is a major part of the entire universe.
A detector attached to the International Space Station also has so far failed to find any of the stuff.
Scientists involved in the experiment said it had eliminated some theoretical ideas about what dark matter might be, but there are many more theoretical models to search for.
"It\'s ghost-like matter," McKinsey said of dark matter.
About one-quarter of the universe is comprised of dark matter \u2014 which is five times as much as the ordinary matter that makes up everything we see.
"We know there\'s stuff out there that is something else, and that makes these searches hugely important because we know we are missing most of the universe," said physicist Neal Weiner.

For 307 years Scotland has been in a union with England.
But chemistry students have begun the painstaking work of turning the huge collection of dyes, test swatches and documents into an online resource.
Likely users include chemists seeking new dyes for textiles and paper that are friendly to the environment; medical researchers interested in dyes for use in treating cancer; and even engineers trying to make solar panels more effective at absorbing the energy from sunlight.
For cancer therapy, substances in the collection may turn out to perform well at tinting cancer cells, Hinks said.
The rest are expected to take a couple of years, even with a small army of 20 undergraduate students working on the task during the school year, and half a dozen or so in summer.
Weaver learned how to invent while on the job.
For much of his career, he worked side by side with chemists with much more schooling, but he more than held his own.
This can be searched by chemical compounds or fragments of compounds and by other characteristics, such as how they perform when heated or exposed to light.
The rest are expected to take a couple of years, even with a small army of 20 students working on the task during the school year, and half a dozen or so in summer.
Some are powders, some are tiny crystals or nuggets.
For now, it consists mainly of 98,000 glass flasks and slim envelopes with cloth samples in them.
This would allow doctors to better see whether they have removed an entire tumor.
Other doctors might dye cancer cells, then kill them by aiming lasers at them.
Students have begun digitizing information about each dye molecule.
The rest are expected to take a couple of years, even with a small army of 20 students working on the task during the school year, and half a dozen or so in summer.
Eventually, however, other chemical companies will be asked to provide dyes as well.
The new library will also be open to other kinds of researchers.
It is expected to become an important tool for many different fields.
There are so many dyes, Hinks said, that the university gave up on counting.
Weaver created the single largest part of the dye library.
Visitors to the online library will be able to search through thousands of three-dimensional models.
It is the smallest part that contains everything that makes a thing what it is.
However, more than a dozen other scientists also helped.
To their surprise, they found that roughly 5 percent of those studied reported getting no pleasure at all from music.
So they followed up by testing 30 more people, grouped by how much they liked music.
This rates such things as music-seeking behavior, use of music to change their mood, whether music was a shared experience between people, and other factors.
Besides some Beethoven and the themes to "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Superman," the group less moved by music chose music by the Verve, Franz Ferdinand and Moby.
They also chose songs by the Verve, Franz Ferdinand and Moby.
Everyone dislikes some kind of music, of course.
This finding was made by a team of scientists from Spain and Canada.
These people showed little emotion even when listening to pieces they had chosen themselves.
"They were not just saying so," said the study\'s co-author, psychologist Josep Marco Pallares.
None of those studied showed signs of general anhedonia.
Subjects were also asked to bring in several songs of their own choice, Marco said.
Artists with more than one song included Carlos Santana, Paco de Lucia and Beethoven.
"I would say it was less typical," Marco said of the mix of tracks the music-lovers brought in.
They also chose songs by the Verve, Franz Ferdinand and Moby.
After the hell of World War II, Germany got massive help with its debt from former foes.
Development activists point to that case when arguing for easier terms for troubled countries today.
Yale University Professor Timothy Guinnane warns against making too many comparisons, partly because Germany was so much more important to global politics than Greece is today.
"It was a hard-nosed decision ... it\'s wrong to say it was an act of generosity."
The country of Cyprus has said it could consider writing off $370 million in rescue loans to Greece.
The U.S., while not directly involved, favors debt relief.
It blamed the current government for being slow on reforms, but said it was clear the debt needed to be made more manageable.
Forgiving debt can get a country back on its feet.
"Greece needs a sort of breathing space," one IMF official said.
The country of Greece has borrowed money from many countries.
A new report argues that Greece should get help.
It now owes more than $332 billion to them.
The United States wanted Germany to be strong again to help stop the spread of communism to Western Europe from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
Germany also had more economic power than Greece has now.
Unlike Germany, Greece has had to pay even though it has not had the money because its economy is weak.
WASHINGTON \u2013 Walkouts and protests by fast-food workers demanding higher wages and the right to join a union began last November and spread to 60 cities nationwide at the end of August.
That is a result of intentional "reforms," including: The weakening of labor unions through changes in and non-enforcement of labor law; International "trade" agreements that put blue-collar workers but not professionals into serious competition with cheaper labor overseas; And many other policy changes that redistribute income up towards the rich.
This kind of mass organizing around domestic economic issues has not been seen for a long time, perhaps since the Great Depression.
Then we might begin to reverse some of the wrongs here at home, too.

Pope Benedict XVI stunned the world on Monday when he announced he is stepping down, saying he is too weak and tired to fulfill his duties.
Benedict, who turns 86 years old this spring, gave his resignation to a group of cardinals.
The last pope to resign was Gregory XII who quit in 1415 to help end a power struggle within the church.
The Roman Catholic Church says that the pope speaks for God and that he should have the final word in all religious matters.
He opposes many of the changes taking place in society, such as gay marriage.
Two African cardinals \u2013 one from Ghana, the other from Nigeria \u2013 are considered to be top contenders for the papal throne.
Choosing a new pope is a process called a "conclave," which is shrouded in secrecy and ancient traditions.

North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey called the shooting "a horrible tragedy."
At first, Slager had said that Scott had taken his Taser, a weapon that delivers an electrical shock, during a confrontation Saturday morning.
They demanded that the police chief answer questions about the investigation, which is being handled by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED).
The North Charleston police department ordered additional body cameras to add to the 115 cameras it already owns.
Officers will wear the small video cameras, which will record their actions.
"We\'re out here for justice, we\'re out here because black lives matter," said Jeremy Johnson, 21.
North Charleston Police Chief Eddie Driggers said he was "sickened" by the video.
Michael Brown was an unarmed black teen who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
However, they said that protests must remain peaceful.
"As the mayor said, right is right and wrong is wrong," said Sanford.

During Wednesday\'s news conference, protesters interrupted with chants of "No justice!
They are "a wonderful group of people, and we let them know how we felt about their loss and how bad it was," the police chief said.
However, Summey cautioned that it could take some time before officers would be patrolling with them.

Stephens views Trail Life as a desperate and doomed escape to a past that no longer exists.
At a meeting held in Nashville, Tenn., this month, Trail Life attracted about 1,200 adult leaders from 44 states.
That decision led to the founding of American Heritage Girls, which now has more than 20,000 members, compared with 2.3 million Girl Scouts.
Since the decision was announced in May, the seven-county district has added 2,000 new families, and expects to attract 6,500 by the end of October, said Bill Gosselin, head of operations.
"I\'m glad I am building something my son can enjoy from next year to when he\'s 18," said Collier.
"Trail Life USA is going to stick to the standards that the BSA abandoned."
It will start its first troops at the end of September.

Wedged behind an exhaust-spewing bus and ahead of a honking car, Luis Enrique Neira urges his scrawny horse Pagatodo through a busy intersection.
Neira has been a horse-cart driver, or a zorrero, since he was 12 years old, scraping out a living hauling loads and sometimes recycling scrap metal and cardboard.
Bogota is requiring them to trade in their horses and carts for small four-wheel vehicles.
Despite her shaky economic state, Garzon said she thinks the program is good.
" That harsh perception surrounding the horse-cart drivers was one of the problems in finding a feasible solution, said Ricardo Mora, the Latin American program manager for the World Society for the Protection of Animals, which worked with the city on the project.
And while images of skinny and mistreated horses gallop across social networks, the vast majority of zorreros treat their animals with care.
"Some of the horses do live in very trying conditions, but so do the owners," Mora said.
"I\'ve been a zorrero all my life and, thank God, I\'ve always made enough money to put some yucca in my soup," said Neira, 51.
Bogota has been home to working animals since before colonial times.
But in those cities the animals are usually kept in rural outskirts.
In Bogota, horse carts are part of the urban landscape, snarling traffic and keeping pedestrians alert for horse droppings.
City governments have been trying to get them off the streets for at least 50 years, Rodriguez said.

But four centuries of beekeeping has likely weakened the species.
In the 1950s, a scientist hoping to produce a tougher tropical bee tried breeding South African bees with European bees in Brazil.
But a day after he set up the hives, their dad, Ross Toyne, said he got a ticket from the city.
"The big question is how long can this go on," said Nolan.
Bees are tidy and obsessively orderly, grooming one another and lining hives with a sticky glue that prevents sickness.
With the help of a beekeeping cousin, they convinced their parents to start keeping hives.
However, a day after he set up the hives, their dad, Ross Toyne, said he got a ticket from the city.
She ended up in the middle of a swarming legal fight between Miami-Dade County and the state over the buzzing honeybees in her yard.
The parties were fighting over the legality of backyard beekeeping.
The county has strict limits on the numbers and locations of private beehives.
The state, however, does not have the same policies.
It was a victory for Davis and other hobbyist beekeepers in Florida, but a small one in the larger war to save the honeybee.
Over the past decade, bees have died because of both natural and man-made dangers including disease, harsh weather, pesticides, invasions of other species and development that destroys their habitat.
Large groups of single crops, called monocultures, also pose challenges for pollinating creatures, including bees.
Longtime beekeepers, who are called apiarists, call these new hobbyists "wannabees."
Today his house serves as his production plant.
Luckily for the twins, their father is a lawyer.
He was able to take a stand and fix the problem with the county.
Toyne also helped Davis with her own thorny legal issues.

Children who cannot live with their families live with foster parents until they find permanent homes.
The children who have been helped so far have been grateful, Walsh said.
She makes sure the store is stocked with clothing for job interviews.

A much-watched undercover video showed sick and injured dairy cows being slapped, poked and forced to their feet with heavy machinery.
There are ways to get a downed cow back on its feet, said Paul Rozadowski, a dairy farmer from Stanley, Wis. You can sneak up behind the sick cow, scream at it, and that may scare the animal into getting up.
Wisconsin dairy industry leaders have said the practices shown in the video are shocking, cruel and not typical of the industry.
Instead, he pokes the cow with an old ink pen to spur it into moving.
A well-run dairy farm would never tolerate such things, Grandin said.
Until the video was released, Wiese Brothers Farm was a milk supplier for Foremost Farms in Baraboo, Wis., and Nestle USA, which makes DiGiorno frozen pizzas.
After the release, Nestle and Foremost quickly cut ties with the farm.
Mercy for Animals said it was seeking talks with Nestle to try to convince the company to adopt anti-cruelty guidelines for its milk suppliers.

President Barack Obama has pledged to take in 10,000 Syrian refugees who are fleeing war in their homeland.
The moment the Franks and their American supporters overcame one obstacle, another arose.
On April 30, 1941, Frank wrote to his old college friend from the United States, Nathan Straus Jr. "I am forced to look out for emigration and as far as I can see U.S.A. is the only country we could go to," he wrote.
The U.S. government was making it harder for foreigners to get into the country \u2014 and the Nazis were making it difficult for them to leave.
By early 1939, more than 300,000 people were on the waiting list to receive a visa to the United States, Breitman wrote.
The Frank family went into hiding in 1942, a day after Margot Frank received a Nazi order deporting her to a labor camp in Eastern Europe.

The humble white potato has lately been at the center of a rollicking debate.
Rather, it is because the Institute of Medicine has determined that the women and children in the WIC population of 8.7 million already eat enough white potatoes \u2014 or nearly enough.
Saying that the exclusion makes potatoes look unhealthy, the National Potato Council has been pushing members of Congress to speak out.
Mark Szymanski, spokesman for the council, said the group was "encouraging Congress to reverse a policy not founded in good nutritional science or common sense."
"We strongly urge you to oppose efforts" to interfere with "science-based rules regarding the federal child nutrition programs," the organizations wrote last month.
Last Tuesday, around 100 doctors went to Capitol Hill to urge Congress to back away from potatoes.
Advocates for the poor said they cannot tolerate what they see as congressional overreach.
The humble white potato has lately been at the center of a fierce fight.
This same group, with the help of Congress, took on President Obama in 2011 when he wanted to limit potatoes in school lunches.
Lately, a fierce fight has been raging over something very humble: the white potato.
"The National Potato Council has declared war on WIC," said the Reverend Douglas Greenaway, president of WIC.

Senators and members of Congress say it is their right to get involved.
"The National Potato Council has declared war on WIC," said Douglas Greenaway, president of WIC.
Congress has never before interfered in this way, said Julie Zaebst of the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger.
Still, she added, "young children\'s diets are much higher in french fries" than they should be.
Lately, a fierce fight has been raging over something very humble: the white potato.
WIC, he said, "is singling out one item from the entire food basket."
Senator Susan Collins, from the potato-growing state of Maine, praised the crop.
Meanwhile, nearly 100 health and science groups have joined together to ask Congress to stay out of the potato fight.
"The National Potato Council has declared war on WIC," said Douglas Greenaway, president of WIC.
Campaigners for the poor say Congress is going too far.
The government is pushing hard to get the potato included in a food program.
It provides food to poor mothers and their young children.
Those foods are the ones considered to be the healthiest for pregnant women and young children.
The council has been pushing the government to speak out.
The council took on President Obama in 2011 when he wanted to limit potatoes in school lunches.
The decision to leave out the potato, he says, is not based on "science or common sense."
Last Tuesday, about 100 doctors went to Washington, D.C.
What makes it worse, she added, is that it is doing it to help potato growers, not mothers and children.
"I didn\'t even dream that it was possible," she said at a news conference at Cardinals headquarters July 28.

The tension between the two Manley High School students started on Facebook, with a post that asked a direct, but loaded, question.
By the time Marquita Riley, 16, and Aaliyah Hudson, 17, ended up in their West Side school\'s "peace room," people in school had been saying that the two girls were going to fight.
"That way, \'cause if anything did happen, it wouldn\'t be my bad," she said.
The philosophy aims to bring together victims and people who wronged them to work through their problems.
It is also being used as an alternative to suspensions and arrests, which can lead to more trouble the community.
The idea is that if something bad happens or someone misbehaves, there needs to be a way to "restore order for the community to move forward," said Ilana Zafran of Umoja Student Development.
City authorities are dealing with shootings and killings among youths.
This idea of restoration is not something even adults do well because it can be messy and complicated, and involves vulnerability, and that is just hard."
But restorative justice is a tactic worth trying, experts say.
His ministry applies the tenets of the philosophy when working with troubled youths.
At Manley and Fenger high schools in Chicago, administrators have created peace rooms where students and workers can go to work out problems.

Julia Lipnitskaia stepped onto the Olympic ice Sunday in red.
Lipnitskaia had already announced her arrival with a spellbinding short program in the opening team competition Saturday night.
This time, it looks like the Russian team is loaded in all fields.
Known for his soaring jumps, power, and his charisma, the 31-year-old had the crowd in the palm of his hand.
But he proved he can still jump \u2013 though he was limping a bit afterward and said his back was not 100 percent.
Lipnitskaia admitted she was worried about skating after Plushenko.

About 7,000 years ago or more, a group of people called the Chinchorro lived along the coasts of northern Chile and southern Peru.
"Whereas the Egyptians considered only kings and other exalted citizens worthy of mummification, the Chinchorro accorded everyone in the community, regardless of age or status, this sacred rite," wrote Bernardo Arriaza, an expert on the mummies.
"Everybody say(s) that here," she said.
Indeed, weather historian Christopher Burt wrote about Arica in 2013, noting that despite its famous reputation for dryness, weather records from 1971 to 2000 suggest it has been somewhat wetter than usual.
Mitchell noted that many of the mummies found in the 1980s had no problems until 10 years ago, "when they started to deteriorate."
Their theory was that more airborne moisture had enabled bacteria to start to chow down on the centuries-old relics.
The result, Mitchell said, was the finding that bacteria were taking advantage of a more humid environment to "use the skin as a nutrient and start to break it down."
A 2007 report from the U.N. agency said that "the impacts of climate change are affecting many World Heritage properties and are likely to affect many more, both natural and cultural, in the years ahead."
The U.S. Agency for International Development is also concerned about how climate change might affect World Heritage sites, and it highlights an example that on a physical level sounds similar to what appears to be happening in Arica.
"Buildings in the rare medieval city of Leh in Ladakh, India, were constructed in a high altitude desert environment and are ill suited to current increases in precipitation," it noted.
It said that the frozen burial mounds of Scythian warlords (called "kurgans"), preserved in permafrost near Siberia, can be destabilized by Arctic thawing.
In this case, it was ice, rather than desert, that had preserved remains intact for a magnificently long time.

"Buildings in the rare medieval city of Leh in Ladakh, India, were constructed in a high altitude desert environment and are ill suited to current increases in precipitation," it said.
Many of these sites have been remarkably preserved precisely because of the fact that they have been undisturbed by climate for so long.
About 7,000 years ago, a group of people called the Chinchorro lived along the coasts of northern Chile and southern Peru.
The Chinchorro were unique in many ways, but perhaps most of all in how they were buried.
If the climate continues to change, the world could lose some of its history for good.
About 7,000 or so years ago, a group of people called the Chinchorro lived along the coasts of northern Chile and southern Peru.
Their lives revolved around fishing from the Pacific Ocean.
While "the Egyptians considered only kings and other exalted citizens worthy of mummification, the Chinchorro accorded everyone in the community, regardless of age or status, this sacred rite," wrote Bernardo Arriaza.
Scientists blame some of these changes on humans burning oil, gas and coal.
This may not be something that can be definitively blamed on global climate change caused by humans, cautioned Ralph Mitchell, a biologist at Harvard University.
They studied samples of mummy skin and dried pig skin, in various conditions.
The result, Mitchell said, was the finding that bacteria was taking advantage of a more humid environment to "use the skin as a nutrient and start to break it down."
The issue around the Chinchorro mummies illustrates just how vulnerable many irreplaceable cultural artifacts may be to a changing climate \u2014 human caused or not.
Its UNESCO department names certain places as World Heritage sites because of their importance to nature or culture.

"As a space-faring country it has been more than 40 years since we have been to deep space," out where asteroids lurk, said G. Scott Hubbard, a Stanford University aeronautics professor.
The "Asteroid Retrieval Mission" is still under development in Washington, D.C. For an agency that has retired the shuttle fleet and grounded a moon-landing plan, the mission represents a major new goal.
Asteroids are the rubble left from the formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.
N JOSE, Calif. -- Hoping to move the heavens, scientists are busy planning to pluck, push and park a spinning asteroid between here and the moon.

NASA calls it "an uncooperative object".
It may not even be solid rock, but just a tumbling bunch of ice.

Now, a researcher from Macquarie University in Australia has published a study examining recent extinctions within two disappearing groups of animals \u2014 reptiles and amphibians.
The results suggested that more than 3 percent of all frog species have disappeared, largely since the 1970s.
"Thus, the data suggest that a runaway train of extinction is now likely to produce what would be seen as a global mass extinction," Alroy writes in the paper.
To put those numbers in context, the data suggest that extinction rates for reptiles and amphibians are about 10,000 times larger than for all other organisms.
"I found a much smaller proportional number of extinctions for snakes and lizards \u2014 half as much," Alroy said.
And while climate change is likely to be an important factor in the coming years "we\'ve already seen the beginning of a major mass extinction."
So he\'s "hoping this paper will encourage more research of that kind."
Now, a researcher from Macquarie University in Australia has published a study examining recent extinctions within two groups of animals \u2014 reptiles and amphibians.
For instance, some places with high rates of extinction were also hotspots for the fungus, while in others scientists do not even know if the fungus was present.

Now, a researcher from Macquarie University in Australia has published a study examining recent extinctions within two groups of animals \u2014 reptiles and amphibians.
Alroy estimated past extinctions for certain types of amphibians and reptiles, including frogs, salamanders, snakes and lizards.
The results showed that more than 3 percent of all frog species have disappeared, largely since the 1970s.
The study suggests that about 200 frog species have gone extinct and hundreds more will be lost over the next century.
Then scientists might be able to start taking action to save them.
"So I\'m hoping this paper will encourage more research of that kind."
This fall, about 57,000 children will be denied a place in Head Start and Early Head Start.
Yasmina Vinci, executive director of the National Head Start Association, said sequestration represented the largest hit to Head Start funding since the program began in 1965.
"I think it\'s going to be devastating for families who were hoping ... for a year or two [of preschool] before their children got into kindergarten," said Cheryl Miller, executive director of the Indiana Head Start Association.
In Ohio, Peg Tazewell, executive director of Knox County Head Start, opted to increase class sizes from 16 or 17 students to about 20 rather than reduce the number of spots for children.
Some of the children will have to ride the bus as far as 20 miles.

A devoted group of Roosevelt scholars and admirers are finishing a design for a library and museum commemorating the life of the 26th president.
The physical library is expected to open in 2019 in Dickinson, a city of about 20,000 residents about 35 miles east of Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota.
The library has already made thousands of notes, letters and photographs available online.
"And I think that\'s an interesting phenomenon; it\'s a very 21st-century idea," said Daniel Stowell, the director and editor of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln.
"By having a traditional exhibit with a station where people could actually look up more in-depth information related to something that catches their interest, it tailors the exhibit to individual visitors," he said.
He established the Elkhorn Ranch along the Little Missouri River about 25 miles east of the Montana border.
The area, often called the "cradle of conservation," would lead the former president to write, "It was here that the romance of my life began."

The physical library is expected to open in 2019 in Dickinson, about 35 miles east of the Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota.
Any library for a president before Hoover must be built without the help of the federal government.
The university, which is spearheading the library project, hopes to add hundreds of thousands of more documents to the growing collection.
Stowell also sits on the advisory board for the Roosevelt library.
The digital records will be drawn from sources including Harvard, the Library of Congress and private collections.
"It was here that the romance of my life began," Roosevelt later wrote.
The National Archives in Washington, D.C., oversees all presidential libraries from Herbert Hoover on.
Scholars hope it will eventually include every Roosevelt-related item they can find.
"And I think that\'s an interesting phenomenon; it\'s a very 21st-century idea," said Daniel Stowell.
In time, it will slowly collect more actual objects to exhibit at the museum.
He said it will look "like the Gilded Age, but updated with computers."

The ark would need to be big enough to support a community of humans and other plants and animals in a fully recycling ecological system.
Any ark would therefore be an experiment, its inhabitants lab animals.
History has shown that people tend to react poorly in rigid states and social systems.
Add to these social limitations permanent enclosure, exile from our planetary surface, and the probability of health problems, and the possibility for mental and emotional difficulties seems quite high.
If there is life, the problems of living in contact with an alien environment could range from harmless to fatal, but will surely require careful investigation.
On the other hand, if the planetary body is dead, then the newcomers will have to transform it using only local resources and the power they have brought with them.
The process will take centuries, during which time the ark, or its equivalent on the alien planet, would have to continue to function without failures.

First, there would need to be a sustainable human civilization on Earth itself to teach us many of the things we would need to know to construct a viable ark.
Second, there would need to be a great deal of practice in an ark orbiting our sun, where we could make repairs and study the ark.
On Thursday, two police officers were shot during a night of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, police have confirmed.
An 41-year-old officer from the St. Louis County Police Department was shot in the shoulder and an officer from the Webster Groves Police Department, 32, was shot in the face, he said.
There is too much violence in our city and this crisis of trust makes us all less safe," said St. Louis political leader Antonio French on Twitter.
On Thursday, two police officers were shot during a night of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, which has been troubled since the killing of Michael Brown last summer.
There is too much violence in our city and this crisis of trust makes us all less safe," said Antonio French, a St. Louis political leader.
Several witnesses said that the shots appeared to come from a hill beyond where protesters had gathered.
Police in riot gear were gathered in the parking lot of the police station across the street.
A video of the events shows the protesters and the police standing idly when shots rang out.
Screams could be heard before the camera operator apparently began running.
"It was the first time I\'d heard a bullet whiz and pass my head," Rice said.
Mike Kinman, 46, a priest, had just arrived at the protest five minutes before the shots were fired.
Two police officers were shot in Ferguson, Missouri, on Thursday.
"They were way up the hill" and hidden in the dark, he said.
St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said two officers were hospitalized after the shooting.
More demonstrations erupted when a grand jury chose not to put Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot Brown, on trial for murder.
The Justice Department also cleared Wilson of any civil rights charges \u2014 that is, it said his actions were not motivated by racism.
There is too much violence in our city and this crisis of trust makes us all less safe," said Antonio French, a St. Louis political leader.

"Full protection under the Endangered Species Act is long overdue for chimpanzees, our closest living relatives," Dr. John J. Pippin said.
In its proposal, Fish and Wildlife pointed out that while some biomedical research on captive chimpanzees continues in the U.S., "there is a decreasing scientific need for chimpanzee studies due to the emergence of non-chimpanzee models and technologies."
Said Pippin, "Chimpanzees have repeatedly proven to be poor models for many areas of human disease research, such as HIV, malaria and other infectious diseases, neuroscience research and cancer."
Animal rights groups praised the move.
The U.S. government wants to give greater protection to chimpanzees.
In early 2011, Ajit Varki of the University of California-San Diego found that chimps and humans experience disease differently.
The latest count put the worldwide population of chimps at 300,000 to 430,000.
Knowledge once gained only by examining a live animal now can be learned in a test tube.
The U.S. government wants to give better protection to chimpanzees.
Right now, only chimpanzees in the wild are listed as endangered.
The researchers hoped doing so would lead to a cure.
But only one got an AIDS-like disease, and died.
An article in the British Medical Journal wrote: "When it comes to testing HIV vaccines, only humans will do."
The latest count put the number of chimps in the world at 300,000 to 430,000.
But Fish and Wildlife said such research will be limited.
Only studies that help the chimpanzee species will be allowed.
People have argued about using chimps in science for years.
When it comes to human diseases, chimps just make bad test subjects, Pippin said.
In both fish, only the scales showed signs of enamel.
Teeth are covered by a thin layer of enamel.
Some fishes, such as the North American gar (also known as Lepisosteus), have scales that are covered with ganoine.
The new study takes a closer look at ganoine, and shines new light on the evolutionary origins of enamel.
It is the study of genetic information stored in DNA.
They examined the Psarolepis from China and the Andreolepis from Sweden, two fish that are over 400 million years old.
It suggests that enamel most likely did not first appear in teeth.
Over millions of years, plants and animals have slowly changed.
Teeth are covered in a thin coating.
The scientists studied the DNA of the gar.

They believe comets may contain material from the earliest days of the solar system.
Studying the comets more closely may help us to learn about the history of the solar system.
Back on Jan. 20, alarm clocks on the craft woke it up to prepare it for landing.
ESA confirmed that those harpoons did not work.
Still, agency officials said the lander was in great shape and they were looking for ways to refire the harpoons.
Mark Bentley, an Austrian scientist who is a lead investigator on the Rosetta project, said that deciding whether to refire the harpoons is "tricky."
Because the comet has such low gravity, it is possible that firing the harpoons could actually push Philae off the comet.
Once it landed, Philae sent a message to the Rosetta orbiter to let it know where it was.
From there, Rosetta sent the information to Earth.
Scientists had warned that there was a real chance that the Philae landing would fail.
This week, scientists in Europe made space history.
The message took 28 minutes to cross 300 million miles of space.

This means fewer people will know things about plants in the future.
An example of what botanists do happened in Arkansas.
The plant is called the Missouri bladderpod.
He wondered what would happen as botanists get older and stop working.
Understanding plants and what they are made of is important, said Joe Miller.
Scientists know collections of plants can be hard to take care of.
The University of Missouri said in May that it would give its plants to the Missouri Botanical Garden.
The University of Arkansas at Little Rock closed its collection a few years ago.
They have collected more than 70,000 different types of plants.
The Nazi flags were torn down while defeated German cities still burned.
The new Federal Republic of Germany enshrined that ban in German law in 1949.
"Americans made a different choice with the symbols of the Confederacy."
Records show that around 450,000 Africans were kidnapped in Africa and brought to what became the United States.
Germany was ruled by the Nazis from 1933 until 1945.

It even became part of some official state flags.
Deidre Berger runs the American Jewish Committee office in Berlin.
She says it is difficult to compare anything to the Holocaust, the Nazi mass killing that took 6 million Jewish lives.
"Americans made a different choice with the symbols of the Confederacy," she said.
Potok praised South Carolina for recently voting to remove the Confederate flag from all official buildings.

They spend a part of each year studying the horrors of Nazi Germany.
The Nazis ruled Germany from 1933 until 1945.
The Confederacy was formed by Southern states that broke away from the United States.
The Confederate flag was treated very differently.
The gold and silver mines up in the mountains enriched the cities in the valley below.
The officials who allowed the companies to plug a drainage ditch and let the water build up inside the mountain?
Or the citizens of this town, who battled an EPA plan to clean up the area for more than 20 years?
No one can say whether one mine is connected to another and, if so, whose polluted water came out of Gold King.
"We love the place we live," Gillon said, his comments delivered in a slight drawl.
Silverton is a tourist town now.
Now, the owners of Gold King and Sunnyside are pointing fingers at each other.
"I believe Sunnyside knew it was going to happen and they stalled any action because it will cost them money to fix it," he said.
Since the spill, locals have complained that the EPA ignored warnings about toxic mine water.
On Aug. 5, a team was examining a former gold mine.

No one can say whose polluted water came out of Gold King.
Then it dumped the poisoned water into a creek.
Now, the owners of Gold King and Sunnyside blame each other.
"It (the plug) did not cause the water buildup at Gold King," Kinross said.
They also say the EPA either did not give them clear answers to their questions.', u'Sometimes, they got no answers at all.
Angels Vet Expresscare sees about 60,000 pets each year.
"But in the end, we figured we could do more for the animals by treating them rather than holding them," he said.
About 13 years ago, Gary started Angels Vet Expresscare.
Now it treats 100,000 animals each year.
Gary and his wife moved to the area more than 30 years ago.
Gary decided that he and Lisa needed to take action.
Angels Vet treats about 60,000 pets each year.
It treats 40,000 rescue animals.
Many of them are treated for free.
Running Angels Vet is not easy, Gary said.
Witnesses said the trembling of the earth went on for several minutes.
"This quake was so big, "said Prajana W. Pradham, who is helping to coordinate the emergency response for the CARE relief agency.
Nepal Republic Media said an Indian Air Force plane carrying 40 rescue and medical workers and 3 tons of supplies arrived in Kathmandu.
Many structures in Nepal are made of brick or rubble and stone, and scores of people were injured in the quake by falling bricks.
"The situation in the Everest base camp is now chaos," he told a Spanish news agency.
Alex Gavan, a mountaineer, posted on Twitter that the quake triggered an avalanche about 5 miles west of Everest.
Rain was forecast for Sunday, which could add to the misery of those whose homes were destroyed.
strong earthquake shook Nepal on Saturday.
He posted on Twitter that the quake started an avalanche about 5 miles west of Everest.
The bad weather could make life even harder for people whose homes were destroyed.
And every two days, she must deal with no running water at home due to strict water-saving measures imposed by the government in response to a prolonged drought.
The boxes were marked with "1465" \u2014 that is the number of families this one moving company has packed for Orlando since January.
Like Puente, thousands of others are bidding farewell to their lives on the island to start over elsewhere in the United States.
Alejandro Garcia Padilla said that at the rate the debt situation is developing, every man, woman and child on the island would owe $40,000 by 2025.
But some U.S. lawmakers have sponsored bills that could eventually allow Puerto Rico to file for bankruptcy.
Some call Puerto Rico "the island of enchantment," but Yessenia Puente does not see it that way.
Puente became a widow six years ago.

Another is to lower the amount companies must pay their workers.
In the coldest parts of the ocean, near the North and South Poles, the water is full of ice.
He decided to move the ship deeper into the ice for safety.
Soon, the waves broke up the ice around the ship into thousands of smaller pieces.
Scientists had never imagined that waves could break up ice so quickly.
There are stormy times ahead.
On Monday, Aug. 12, Musk unveiled the design of his Hyperloop, a $6 billion high-speed transit system powered by solar energy.
The line would travel at speeds of up to 760 miles per hour (mph) and have the feel of an airliner, Musk said.
The state is in the middle of trying to build its own bullet train, a $68 billion project that has grown in cost and fallen behind schedule.
This one operates like delivery systems that have been used at neighborhood banks, sending packages through pressurized air tubes.
They doubt that large numbers of drivers or airline passengers will be attracted to the bullet train.
But the circuitous path added to the cost, and resulted in slower projected trip times.
"You get into the public arena, and that is a different game."
Musk said the answer is his Hyperloop.
"Normally I would think this idea is borderline crackpot, but this guy has a track record," said Michio Kaku.
By contrast, the California bullet train system envisions a much bigger annual ridership: at least 20 million.
But the winding path added to the cost, and resulted in slower projected trip times.
"Musk has been able to get away with what he has done because he does it with his own money," said Lou Thompson.
On Monday, Musk unveiled the design of his Hyperloop, a $6 billion high-speed transportation system powered by the sun.
The line would travel up to 760 miles per hour (mph) and have the feel of an airliner, Musk said.
It would be a trip across the 382 miles, connecting two stations.
Imagine paying $20 and sitting down inside a Space Age car in Los Angeles.
The winding path added to the cost, and resulted in slower projected trip times.
He wanted to get it into the public discussion, he said, before the state wastes more time and money on what he called a failed system.
Then Musk started the rocket company SpaceX and co-founded electric car giant Tesla.
But the winding path added to the cost, and resulted in slower projected trip times.

On Monday, Musk unveiled the design of his Hyperloop, a $6 billion high-speed transportation system powered by the sun.
The line would travel up to 760 miles per hour (mph) and have the feel of an airliner, Musk said.
The panels would generate much more energy than the Hyperloop would use, Musk said.
They doubt that a lot of drivers or airline passengers will be attracted to the bullet train.
Musk said 7.4 million people could take the Hyperloop a year.
The winding path added to the cost, and resulted in slower projected trip times.
The cars would shoot through a steel tube on a cushion of air.

He revolutionized how people pay for things online.
He changed spaceflight missions for NASA.
"It would be great to have an alternative to flying or driving," he said.
It would instead be "both one of the most expensive per mile, and one of the slowest in the world."
He started and sold PayPal to EBay for $1.5 billion.
